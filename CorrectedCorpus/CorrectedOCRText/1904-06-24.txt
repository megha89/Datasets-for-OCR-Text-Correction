VOUGHIOGHENY
Tbe Proper Way of Pronouncing This
Indian Name
Perhaps the most difficult geograph
ical name in the United States is
Youghlogheny, or geny, as it Is some
times spelled, the name of "a creek in
western Maryland and Pennsylania
Few besides naties of the region pro
nounce it with the chief accent on the
penultimate and who so essays it with
the accent elsewhere finds his mouth
filled with a meaningless confusion of
owels and consonants The first syl
lable is "Yougb," pronounced "Yo,"
with a short "o" The second is"i"
short, the "o" following is almost if
not quite unheard in the mouth of the
natie, while tbe last two syllables are
those made familiar la "lleghany,"
though there is een here a question of
"a" long or "c" short
The pronunciation of Youghiogheny
is, howeer, a simple matter with the
modern spelling compared to what it
must hae seemed to the stranger who
met it with the old spelling On an
ancient map of the region the name Is
spelled "Yogbyyoyghgania" oubtless
this spelling came nearer than that
now in use to indicating aptly the In
dian pronunciation of the name

NOTES OF ISCOR
 The unsatisfactory condition of
the industrial world, incident to the
frequency of labor strikes, is a prom
inent topic of conersation whereer
one goes On a trip to San Fran
cisco the other day, two women
were relating their experience Both
were married and had families The
husband of one was a machinist,
who had been thrown out of a good
job by the strike on the Santa Fe
road With his family he was isit
ing friends, waiting for the settle
ment of the trouble between the
great railroad corporation and its
"striking employes, and hoping that
the adjustment would soon be made
that he might return to his work
The other lady was a miner's wife
Her husband had worked in
Cuer de Lene district in Idaho, and
also in the Colorado fields The
wages were good, and in the course
of a few months they managed to
sae $600 or $700  strike came
along and they had to moe to seek
work elsewhere, and their saings
were dissipated in a few weeks This
sort of experience had been repeated
seeral time's No sooner had they
got settled, and were getting a little
ahead, than a strike was precipitated,
compelling them to make a fresh
start in life It was eident from
tbe conersation indulged in that
the toilers were weary of this busi
ness; it was not to their taste They
began to realize that an organiza
tion instituted for their benefit,
whicb is the fruitful source of in
augurating war instead of peace, is
detrimental to their interests The
instances cited occurred in a small
railroad depot among tbe few pas
sengers therein awaiting transporta
tion to their respectie destinations
They sere to illustrate how wide
spread is the feeling, een among the
army of organized labor, that the
despotic methods of unionism to ad
ance the cause of the workingman
hae signally failed to secure the
promised industrial millennium It
is a moot question today if the real
sentiment of the toiling masses were
allowed free expression, whether it
would not be found oerwhelming in
faor of the oldestablished system
of eery man's right to sell his labor
whereer and for whatsoeer he
pleases, without let or hindrance of
any organization whateer The
history of labor unions has been,
and doubtless will continue to be, a
neerending round of organization,
disruption and reorganization
The goernor of Pennsylania has
appointed ttorneyGeneral P C
Knox successor to the late Senator
Mat Quay The attorneygeneral
has signified his intention to accept,
which will necessitate the placing of
a new man in the cabinet Presi
dent Rooseelt will no doubt secure
the right man for the place

On the 12th of Feb, at 8 in the morn
ing, the Etage left Eagle for awson,
distance 102 miles, fare $25 Four
big horses drew a 6eated sleigh with
plenty of robes and eight passengers
Jack owning, the drier, is an old
"sourdough," ery proud of his team
and reputation for getting in on time
The route is on the rier, and great
skill is required to aoid hummocks
and creices, the latter being especi
ally dangerous fter the first freeze
the rier falls seeral feet, and the
cracks, chasms, and sloping slabs of ice
make trael quite risky The ice that
comes floating down before the freeze
up, sometimes piles up in the rier
bends more than 10 feet high
We came 12 miles and crossed the
11 st meridian into Canada Ten miles
further and we came to a road house,
where we warmed, changed horses and
had a good dinner Just at dark we
reached Forty Mile, where we passed
the night and the custom house t
7a m were again on the road, with
the same horses and three more pas
sengers, who had come down from
Jack Wade creek en route to the "out
side" The thermometer showed 38°
below zero, and our drier and three
passengers had their faces frozen Half
way to awson, where we stopped for
dinner and fresh horses, the body of a
man had just been brought in who had
frozen to death on the trail two miles
away, but less than 80 rods from a
woodcutter's cabin '  
ITT , 
We arried in awson at 7 in the
eening The following day, Feb 1th,
I celebrated my birthday by resting in
my room in the hotel, only going out
for meals Feb 16th I started on a
bicycle for White Horse The route
lay up the Klondike for eight miles,
then up Hunker creek 19 more, to the
summit, beyond which is the head of
ominion creek Nearly the whole
distance placer mines are being worked
eery 500 ' feet or less Seen from a
short distance the great "dumps" of
pay dirt resemble hay stacks ll along
the route are saloons, stores and road
houses, and the whole region is "hum
ming" I stopped oer night at the
Summit hotel Next morning six
inches of fresh snow showed that the
wheel was out of business for a week at
least, so I put it on a stage that was
just leaing for White Horse and took
a seat by the drier ominion creek
is 38 miles long, and just as liely as
Hunker These are two of the best
creeks in the Klondike district They
hae seeral towns, each haing a few
hundred people, with stores, churches,
repair shops, etc The next day we
had left the mining region and entered
the forests that coer the hills The
third day we crossed the Stewart rier,
which is naigable for steamboats, 265
miles from its confluence with the
Yukon Crossed the Pelly rier, four
miles aboe its mouth at Fort Selkirk,
where it unites with the Lewes and
forms the Yukon proper Fifty miles
further up we crossed the Lewes, and
did not strike it again until we reached
White Horse, which is 330 miles by
stage route from awson, fare $75, ex
clusie of meals and lodging, which
aerage $550 per day Three regular
stages leae each end of the route eery
week, besides seeral extras One day
a strange object showed up in the dis
tance, a square tent on a sleigh, with
smoke coming through a hole in the
roof It was a cargo of fresh eggs en
route to awson, which the owner ex
pected to make money on if he could
keep them from freezing" Seeral dogs
followed our sleigh, and it was great
sport to watch them chase rabbits,
which were ery plentiful The light
snow was oer two feet deep Rabbits
could run on it, but the dogs would
sink almost out of sight Their hunt
ing instinct would make them start
after eery rabbit they saw, but after
floundering a few rods they would slink
sheepishly back to the road, only to re
peat the process the next time a rabbit
appeared The latter seemed to roally
enjoy the fun
On nearly eery stage we met I no
ticed one or more bicycles, but did not
try to buy them although the owners
were willing to sell When the road is
good a man can easily make 80 miles
a day with a wheel
fter eight days of staging I reached
White Horse, and neer had a railroad
look so initing Trael to the interior
is the heaiest eer known at this sea
son Eery day one or two stages
start for awson, each carrying 11 pas
sengers  stampede is on to the
Elsek diggings, 160 miles west of here,
said to rial the Klondike but not yet
so proen Not more than one in ten
of these stampedes profit any except
the hotel and transportation men Still
it is not reasonable to suppose that
Nome and the Klondike are the only
ery rich places in the north, and more
bonanzas are liable to be struck any
time
On Feb 28th I arried in Skagway
not much the worse for wear, and glad
I had made the trip, but like the boy
after a dinner of pusley greens, who
liked what he had had but didn't want
any more Sincerely,

Prof Williams aud his grammar
grade pupils hired two rigs Friday
eening and started on their way re
joicing to atteud the commencement
exercises of the lone union high school
The party arried in lone and suc
ceeded in taking in the town before the
eening's exercises began The pro
gramme proed to be a most interest
ing one, and so delighted the young
people from Jackson that they con
cluded to attend the dance that had
been arranged to take place after the
entertainment The Prof, objected at
first, but being only one but of a dozen,
and all of them grammar grade grad
uates at that, he was finally oerruled
and had to submit gracefully Being a
man who is not only heay set but rather
set in his way, he landed i the surrey on
the homeward trip with a solidity that
boded ill for those who sat on the op
posite side ll the occupants noticed
how tbe ehicle tipped his way, and
remarked that they belieed they
would tip oer Williams only grinned
and awaited bis opportunity Finally
the horses shied and Williams, so the
drier says, threw his ponderous weight
on the lower side and oer went the
rig with all its occupants The pro
fessor got up laughing, thinking that
he had at last played een with a lot of
them at least When daylight appear
ed it was noticed that his hair was
almost white, showing that he himself
had been badly frightened No one
was hurt, and the class agreed to pay
all damages if Williams would agree

On Friday of last week, at the Rich

wounding of another Mr Lench,
proprietor of the hotel, had some dif
ficulty in settling with one of his board
ers by the name of Jahns, or better
known as the "Crazy utchman"
fter a wordy dispute Mr Jahns se
cured a horse and rode to San ndreas,
where he imbibed freely and told of his
troubles la the afternoon he obtained
a rifle and asserted that he was going
back to the hotel at Rich Gulch and
een up mattnrs by killing Mr Lench
With the matter weighing heaily
upon his mind he proceeded to carry
out his threat rriing at the hotel
the first person be saw was bartender
Eans, a relatie by marriage of the
proprietor, and raising his gun he shot
Eans squarely in the forehead, killing
him instantly Mr Lench hearing the
shooting seized his shot gun and ran to
the relief of Eans, where he beheld
Jahns trying to get another cartridge
into the rifle Taking in the situation
hie raised his gun airl shot Jahns
through the right shoulder, inflicting
an ugly and painful wound, but not
necessarily a fatal one r Endicott
of Jackson was called in consultation
with a Calaeras doctor They care

Notes By the Way
June 19—1 send a few notes dotted
down while traeling on the train be
tween Cheyenne and ener It was
nearly midnight before we got fairly
started on the trip to the World's Fair
from the Sacramento depot, the delay
of nearly an hour being occasioned by
the congestion of passenger traffic in
cident to the excursion rates to St
Louis The increased trael and the
confusion necessarily arising from the
stopoer priileges allowed to tourists,
are the terror of the conductors all
along the line The remark is freely
made by railroad employes that they
hope there will neer be another
world's fair From start to finish this
cry of distress is more or less heard
Haing ample time during the seen
hours' stay in Sacramento, I did not
order tickets in adance It took the
agent one and a half hours to make out
the two tickets for msilf and Mrs
Webb It was not owliig to delay in
deciding upon the route That was
soon settled, going by the Central Pa
cific and Union Pacific, by way of en
er, and return by way of New Orleans
and the Sunset route The tickets are
frequently a yard long, and the map
ping out of the route by the sections of
the tickets is a study for the agents
The ticket holder often gets mixed as
to the course of procedure on the route,
and the conductors and other officials
get puzzlod at eery turn to unrael
the mysteries of these wonderful ex
cursion tickets '•'XV*
Through the Sierras in night time
and the sagebrush state in day light
the trip was without special interest
The writer passed through Neada
thirty years ago, and while towns along
the railroad hae grown, in seeral
cases, beyond recognition since the
early 70's, the geueral characteristics
of the treeless, sagebrush waste re
mains the same That this uniniting
desert possesses ast agricultural possi
bilities is eident from what has been
accomplished in isolated spots The
alley of the Humboldt, now surrend
ered to stockraising, awaits but the
magic touch pf irrigation to, transform
it into smiling fields of grain and gar
den, equaling in fertility the watered
regions of Utah and Colorado
Reaching Ogden early Thursday
morning we took a side trip to Salt
Lake City, remaining there until next
morning This preatjpn qf the Latter
ay Saints— founded in 1g7 by Brig
ham Young and his fellow religious
zealots under the impression that Gen
tile ways would not reaoh their wilder
ness home for a century— is conceded
at this day tp be a raadel pjty' Those
Mormon piqneers^whateer may be
said of their doctrinal teaching—plan
ned wisely and well as regards their
temporal Zion What impresses the
isitor with admiration are th,e liing
streams flowing pn either side of the
streets These adantages are not
possessed to anything like the same ex
tent in any other city of its size in the
United States Jn the center qf tftese
thorough fares are placed the electric
poles fqr power and light— another
feature peculiar tq Salt Lake On
either side tho street, car lines are
operated, one side for the qutgqing and
the other sjdo for th,e inclining, cars
There js no, cpnfusion, and no danger
in getting on or off the cars of colliding
with passing cars Such an arrange
ment of course would not be practicable
were it not for the unusual width of
the streets, thqrq heing ample room
for other ehicle traffic outside the car
lines It is neer found necessary to
cross the car lines by driers of buggies
or wagons Salt Lake is growing

that an applicant is well prepared, but
through nerousness or fright is unable
tq dp herself justice and cgnsequently
fails In, thU'paae a written examina

Bohool Entertainment
We unintentionally omitted the
school entertainment last week The
affair was a most creditable one, and
young people wb,Q wqrk qnd make a
success of such things bo early in life
should be gien eery encouragement
to stimulate them to greater efforts
There was no feature of the entertain
ment that did not bring credit to those
who took part The singing was ex
ceptipnally good, while the instrumental
music and recitations were all that
pould be expected from pupils of eir
ages The farce was well rendered and
greatly pleased the parents and friends
present Great credit is due those
who assisted the young people in
hecoming so proficient in their work

Republican Conention
The republican national conention
has been in session all the week, but up
to the time of going to press no nomina
tions hae formally been made The
nominee for president was selected by
the people of the United States months
before the conention met, and there is
nothing left for the conention to do in
that respect but to ratify the people's
choice Senator Fairbanks seems to
be alone in the fight for the ice presi
dency, and the next republican ticket
will undoubtedly be Rooseelt and
Fairbanks The conention is com
posed of the ablest men of the nation
ExSecretary Root was temporary
chairman, and Speaker J G Cannon
is permanent chairman The framing
of the platform and appointing of com
mittees has occupied the time so far
The California delegation has receied
faorable consideration in the selection
of committees The platform as out
lined is a strong one, and it seems to be
the preailing opinion of all the dele

be chosen by the largest majority eer

Preston School Contracts

let by the board of trustees for the fur
nishing of supplies for the Preston
School were gien to local men This
is a moe in the right direction So
long as the business men of lone can
furnish the supplies at reasonable rates
they should be allowed to do so The
success of any new institution depends
largely upon the good will of the peo

THE B RUPEE
Bahrain Got Rid ot It, bnt Not the
War He Intended
"There lied in Rampur, India, a
ender of sweetmeats named Bahram
whose wife had weak eyes," said the
story teller "One day this man went
to see a friend at the bazaar, and he
left his stiill in the woman's charge
'Be careful, mind you, about the
change,' he said to her But neerthe
less when ho returned home he found
that she had taken In a bad rupee
piece He could hardly sleep that night
for rage aiul sorrow In the morning
he arose early, and, determined to get
rid of the bad rupee, he set out through
the town, yoon he met a boy •
" 'Boy,' he said, 'do you know the
sweetmeat shop of H?' (H was a
rial ender) 'Well, take this rupee,
go to ll's shop and spend a pice for
sweetmeats there The sweetmeats
you may keep; I want the change'
"The boy departed merrily and in a
little while returned with his mouth
full
" 'So you got the change without trou
ble, eh?' said the man as he counted it
'nd did ll make no examination of
the rupee?' \ 
"'Oh,' said the boy, 'I didn't go as
far as ll's I got the sweetmeats at

ROCK FORMTION
In One Sense Stones o Grow, and
In nother They o Not
Rocks do not grow in the sense that
plants do They may increase In size
by means of accretion, and they may
also undergo other changes Old sea
beds, lifted up and exposed for ages, be
come stratified beds of sandstone or
limestone; olcanic ashes and laa
strewn oer hills and plains become
tufa, hard enough for building stone,
and the pebbly shores of riers and
smaller streams may sometimes
change into conglomerates The simple
mineral, howeer, does grow, especial
ly when it takes upon itself the form
of a crystal  sparkling prism of
quartz increases from an atom to
monster crystals of arying length and
size by what geologists know as a
"process of addition aud assimilation"
this process is wonderfully slow, but
with a mathematical exactness that is
a surprise to persons een "well up"
in the science of geology In one sense
6tones grow; in another they do not
The crystal may become longer and
larger, but the bowlder on the roadside
will not increase a hairbreadth in

Moat Horrible of ll reams
No words are strong enough to point
out the danger of slow poisoning by
drugs which are often taken to procure
sleep, whether it be an alcoholic night
cap, morphine, opium, chloral or any
other The medical man has recourse
with reluctance to these as a last and
temporary resort, and only he enn tell
how many lies are wrecked by the
ill timed use of them and their subse
quent abuse Of all horrible dreams
none is so awful as those which assail
people who habitually use these false
comforters Better than all the drugs
In the world for procuring sleep are
simple food, a regular life and a calm
mind— Cassell's
Its Hurtful Sedentary Habit
"I think," said the meditatie boy,
"that a wasp would be all right if it

CURIOUS WORSHIP
The Custom of Throwing Prayers t
an Idol In Japan
long the sacred road of Nikko, in
Japan, Is an idol about which centers
one of the most curious worships in
the world Upon the surface of the
statue are seen little pieces of what
appears to be dried paper If you stand,
by the idol for awhile and wait for a
worshiper to come along, you will see
what these bits of paper are The de
otee halts in front of the image, then
scribbles a prayer on a bit of the pa
per The wad he then chews up Into
a ball and hurls at the god If it
hits the face and sticks, the prayer is
sure to be granted, and the pious pil
grim goes away happy If the ball
sticks to some portion of the body, the
omen is not quite so propitious, and If
it falls to the ground there is absolute
ly no hope
Such a mode of prayer is een more
curious than the praying wheels of the
Buddhists, who set the wheel reoling
and reel off prayers by machinery s
John L Stoddard, the lecturer, saidPersonal
"One sees, of course, numberless
strange rites connected with religion
In traeling about the world, but
Japan Is the only land I hae eer
isited where deities sere us targets
for masticated, prayers!"

To Presere the Color of Floiera"
 way to presere the colors of flow
ers when pressing them is to immerse
the stem of the fresh plant in a solu
tion of 31 grains of alum,  of niter and
186 of water for a day or two, until
the liquid is absorbed, then press the
plant ln the usual way, sift some dry
sand oer the flower and submit to a
gentle heat for about twenty hours
The Funny Bone
 most unpleasant sensation is caused
by the iolent excitation of the ulnar
nere due to a blow on the elbow This
nere passes down on the inner side of
the arm and then ratheV inconsiderate
ly bends round and enters the forearm
at the tack of the elbow Joint ny
one who has felt his neighbor's elbow
sticking into his ribs knows that the
elbow is remarkably deficient In flesh
The nere is therefore at this point
ery near the surface and has little to
shield it from a blow If we are bo
unfortunate as to gie our elbow a
smart tap we obtain a practical con
firmation of the fact that the ulnar
nere is the principal sensory nere of
the forearm and hand
