 PUb That Could Talk
' natural curiosity captured on the

Bignor Caana and exhibited in all the
great cities of Europe during the years
1850, 1860, 1861 and 1862, where it was
adertised as the "talking flsh," was
in reality a species of the frican seal,
well known to naturalists on account
of ita wonderful powers of mimicry
This particular animal was about
twele feet in length and weighed
something oer 800 pounds It had a
fine, dogllke head and large, beautiful
black eyes, which seemed to sparkle
with intelligence wheneer the crea
ture was spoken to by any one It was
ery docile and when told to dance
would roll oer and oer in its bath
tub, with first tail and then head aboe
the water, all the time chattering as
though enjoying the sport as much as
the spectators did It soon learned
many odd tricks and, it is claimed,
learned to articulate at least three
words ery plainly — iz, "mamma,"
"papa" and "John," the last being its
keeper's name When told to pray it
would clasp its flippers In the attitude
of supplication and put on a sanctimo
nious look

THE IONE RO
 trip oer the road between
Jackson and lone must conince any
unprejudical mind that it is in a de
plorable condition The truth is ap
parent almost the entire length of
the thoroughfare that it is practi
cally worn out For the greater
part of the distance the wagon way
is also the water way It is dis
couraging, after the years of special
taxes leied for the main purpose of
 putting this road in good condition;
after pouring out money without
stint in the ain effort of making
 this artery of traffic a macadamized
road that would continue in good
shape, with slight repairing, for
• many years, to find that its metal
• eneering has been ground into dust;
that no semblance of a turnpike
 character remains Its crown — if it
eer had any worth speaking of —
has been conerted into a hollow
way, and eerything tends to show
that the ast sums of money ex
pended upon it — while admitting
 that some change for the better has
resulted as compared with former
days— hae fallen lamentably short of
meeting public expectations It is
useless to look for its transforma
; tion into a fairly good road under
' the existing road system Its con
' dition today is a standing protest
to the present wofully defectie
road law We hae not got, and we
neer will get, adequate returns for
the money expended Thousands of
dollars hae been wasted in trying
to water it; large sums hae been
thrown away in sprinkling it with
oil; but the one fact that faces the
casual obserer today is that neither
water nor oil can materially aid it at
present What it wants is road
building material of the hardest
character that can be had
 rumor is afloat to the effect that
a moement is contemplated in of
ficial quarters to spend the money
in the special road fund in pouring
oil on this troublesome highway It
will cost a couple of thousand dollars
to put sufficient oil to quiet the dust
for the summer season nd that
is the sum total of the benefit that
will accrue from the expenditure
We hae no hesitation in denouncing
any moement in this direction — as
the roadway now stands— as a reck
less waste of money Superisor
mick is reported to be opposed to
this scheme He wants the money
deoted to permanent improement
, — something beyond the mere laying
of a few clouds of dust in the sum
mer season nd we beliee his
judgment in this respect will be sus
tained by ninetenths of the tax
payers The only campaign of opera
tions that will command support is
to deal with this ital artery of
traffic with the iew of keeping it in
the best traelable condition, with
the funds aailable, during the win
ter months, as well as the period of
traction engine traffic Ths experi
ence of one season has exploded the
idea that the traction engine is an
important helper in the roadmaking
business It is the same as any
other kind of heay trael Its ten
dency is to wear out a road, not to
improe it nd the peculiar tootb
• like construction of its broad tires
seems to aid in the disintegration of
the road bed Still we do not claim
that the traction engine should be
ignored in the expenditure of road
money, but we do contend that the
tiding oer the wet season with the
least possible inconenience to the
• freighting business is the ital point
to be eer kept in iew in the dis
bursement of the road funds of the
three districts inoled

Big Game
Game Warden rditto, when dressed
in hunting attire, is an ideal looking
nimrod No one would eer suspect
him of being an officer of the law, a
friend of the innocent doe, and a pro
tector of the bounding deer Two
years ago Chezro rditto accepted an
appointment at the hands of the board
of superisors as game warden of ma
dor county t that time he took a
solemn oath to protect and defend the
game, and enforce the game laws of
the state and county as he iound them
upon the statute books in so far as it
lay within his power so to do rditto 's
sense of hearine is ery acute, and on
Saturday, while standing on the side
walk, he distinctly heard seeral re
ports of gun shots fired in the direction
of Mattley's field ressing himself in
hunter's attire, with gun in hand, he
boldly announced to his friends that
he was going after does and would
not return until he had secured his
game His friends stood in amazement
to see the officer of the law go forth \o
carry out his threat in supposed direct
iolation of what he was sworn to de
fend On the outskirts of town he
called his deputy, O Reichling, to his
assistance, and together they went
forth to ascertain from whence the gun
shot reports had come They had not
gone far before they discoered Chris
Bon in the act of shooting does in
iolation of the, law rditto had
found his man; he also found seen
does He forthwith made himself
known, and placed Mr Bon under ar
rest s the trio walked through
town on their way to the justice' office
the bystanders took in the situation,
and applauded the warden for the man
ner in which he had carried out his
deception Mr Bon plead guilty and
paid a $25 fine, lost his does, and wont
home satisfied that it was illegal to
slaughter does before the Ist of July
Barrett was on hand as usual to
claim the birds, but rditto has read
all the law books from ' Blackstone to
the county hospital reports, and under
stands his business He gae the does
to the sick and needy, and remarked
to Mr Barrett that he might be able
to fool all of the people some of the
time, and some of the people all of the
time, but that there was one fellow
that neer got fooled but once
eafness Cannot be Cured
by local applications as they cannot
reach the diseased portion of the ear
There is only ono way to cure deafness,
and that is by constitutional remedies
eafness is caused by an inflamed con
dition of the mucous lining of the Eus
tachian Tube When this tube' is in
flamed you hae a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can be
taken out and this tube restored to its
normal condition, hearing will be de
stroyed foreer; nine cases out of ten
are caused by Catarrh, which is noth
ing but an inflamed condition of the
mucous surfaces
We will gie One Hundred ollars
for any case of eafness (caused by ca
tarrh) that cannotbe cured by Hall's

Vandalism
On Sunday morning, between the
hours of 1 and 3 o'clock, some person
bent on mischief entered the Jackson
stage barn and proceeded in his own
deilish way to destroy whips, har
ness, cushions and trimmings, think
ing perhaps that he would preent the
stage from making its daily trip that
day The damage was discoered in
time howeer to secure the serices
of a harnessmaker, and all necessary
repairs were made in time for the stage
to be off at the appointed hour Just
what object any person could hae in
doing this cannot be conjectured If
it was for reenge against owner or
drier for some fancied wrong, it was
certainly a most cowardly way of seek
ing it Cutting the harness might en
danger the lies of many, and perhaps
friends of the one doing the mischief
On the other band, if the perpetrator
has the spirit of <lpst ruction born
within him, he was working to satis
fy his desire to do something that
would inconenience others Mr
Raab, the owner of the stage line, is a
gentleman who by hard work and hon
est dealings with his fellow man has ac
cumulated considerable property He
has no known enemies, and is at a loss
to know why any one should seek to do
him injury It has been his one desire
since purchasing the line to gie his
customers the best serice possible for
their money He estimates his im
mediate loss at between $30 and $0
Chris Meiss, the drier, is a young
man of ability, a thorough reinsman,
always at his post of duty, eer work
ing to carry out the instructions of his
employer, and always paying respect
ful attention to the requests of those
who take passage with him Eery
effort will be made to bring the per
petrator or perpetrators of this crime
to justice It may take a little time,
but t}io clew Is strong and the fear of
being grasped by the strong arm of
justice will be a far greater punishment
than to be confined within prison walls

NOTES FROM
GOL MINES
Gwin— Three hundred men are now ,
employed  great deal of work has
been done on top, building, repairing,
etc The 80stamp mill is running con
tinuously The mine is apparently do
ing its duty towards the stockholders
at the present time
Marsino Grael Mine—  new
formation has appeared in and around
the grael  cement laa carrying
free gold has been encountered which,
if it should continue, would necessitate
the erection of a small mill, and greatly
add to the output of the mine
FremontGoer— The situation re
mains, the same as last week The
sand flume is nearing completion The
strike is still on, and the company
shows no disposition to yield
The Kimball Properties—Kim
ball & Sons, of efender, own four
claims in the Pioneer district, iz, the
eadwood, eadsheep, and south ex
tension to the Pioneer, all adjoining
claims, and one next to the Q Mason
mine On the eadwood a small hoist
has been erected, and seeral tons of
good ore was taken out during the last
winter 20 tons of rock was milled last
year that yielded $30 to the ton in free
gold The shaft is 70 feet deep, and
the pay ledge is from 18 to 2 inches
wide It is conceded to be the efend
er ein Six tons of $30 rock and 150
tons of $6 rock, are now on the dump,
and will be milled during the summer
The shaft on the eadwood is 200 feet
deep Seeral years ago 75 tons from
this mine was crushed, and yielded $25
per ton in free gold The sulphurets
are ery rich, bringing the alue up to
a much higher standard This ein is
about 20 inches wide in the shaft
In the Pioneer extension a 00 foot
tunnel has been run, and the prospects
are good So confident are the owners
that these properties are good, that
they will bond them to any one who
will take hold of them and work them
properly When men who own such
properties are willing to take chances
on results, those who hae capital to
inest in mines should not hesitate to
open them up, with a iew of purchas
ing in case they proed satisfactory
Mother and Babe United
 tender and touching funeral was
that of little Mary Frates The re
mains of her mother, which had been
resting in Holy Cross cemetery in San
Francisco, were brought home so that
the flower of the family might rest upon
the bosom that had nursed her into ex
istence nd from loe's shining circle
the gems drop away, and from the
midst the garden's beauties, the most
delicate and fragrant buds, do some
times but appear to enrapture and en
chant s — and then fadeaway — to leae
the beholder sorrowful So it was with
little sister, for Mary lone Frances
Frates was known to all her friends by
that tender appellation, "Sister" She
ma but reign long enough to enrich the
heart cords of loed ones and then de
part, leaing an untold acancy that
neer can be filled "V'
 quintet of October and the flowery
seasons hae rolled away since little
Mary Frates was born to sweeten her
mother's last days upon earth, and
bless the declining' years of her father
Nature had been laish upon this child
She bestowed her bounteous gifts, for
"Little Sister" was blessed with a
sweet, amiable disposition which graced
with an intellect that attracted the at
tention of all These traits blended,
made a personality that won the ad
miration of strangers, and promised
ana! augured a grand woman The
souls of father and mother communed
with their baby darling on earth The
lmighty harkened to their yearnings,
and on the 27th of May, as old King
Sol was nearing the meridan, He beck
oned to her soul, and as gently and as
noiselessly as the sunlight departs from
the hills Sister's soul took , its onward
Bight to the great beyond, into the
outstretched arms of father and mother

Italian Picnic
Sunday's picnic was in many respects
the most successful held by the society
in many years There hae been larger
gatherings at times than were present
Sunday, but no more enthusiastic or
agreeable crowd eer met at Fullen's
groe From early Sunday morning
until 2 a m Monday morning, the
merry oices and sweet strains of music
could be heard unceasingly Each at
traction tended to add to the day's
pleasantness The merrygoround
was patronized by the babe In arms
and the grayhaired grandmothers
bowed down with age The literary
exercises were not carried out as pro
grammed, owing to the failure of one
orator to be present The disappoint
ment felt by the loss of one was more
than offset by the success of the other
The address of Charles H Crockerfis
spoken of by all as a masterly effort
Neatly dressed, with a clear and ring
ing oice, and perfectly selfpossessed,
Mr Crocker spoke as one who thor
oughly mastered his subject, bringing
great credit upon himself as well as
satisfying and honoring the committee
that selected him as speaker The
baseball game was one of the afternoon
attractions While not up to the
standard it was enjoyed by many
West Point took the $50 and Jackson
the $25 purse' The dance was better
patronized than eer The Stockton
band was greatly appreciated, and the
musicians declared it to be one of the
best natured crowds that they had eer
played for Not a disturbing element
appeared upon the grounds during the
day or eening Socially it was a great
success We cannot say how it result
ed financially until the committee
makes its final report

Condition of Boads
The county roads are now in fairly
good condition throughout the east
ern portion of the county If the
superisors hae more money at their
disposal during the year, a portion of
it should be resered for winter use
When a particular spot becomes im
passable it should be fixed at once, and
at a time when a solid foundation can
be put in To jeopardize life and prop
erty waiting for springtime to form a
crust upon which to sprinkle a little
grael is sometimes hazardous, and a
roadbed repaired in this way is only

Portußuene Characteristics
The men of Portugal are as fond of
show as are the women Their~fingers
are nearly always loaded with rings,
and about their bodies, which are
often as round as the bowls of their
tobacco pipes, hang chains as thick as
ropes, from which are suspended
bunches of trinkets
The Portuguese dandy is ery fond
of anything that will attract public
attention to his much esteemed per
son boe his snowy est he wears
a craat of gleaming colors, while in
his buttonhole Is stuck a full blown
rose of inordinate size I think I am
pretty safe in saying that most of the
promenadeis I hae, seen strutting
about in the chieU^ thoroughfares on
Sunday with a riding whip In their
hands and handsome spurs on their
heels hae neer set foot in the stir
rup The spur is to them a sign of
nobility which they arrogate to them
seles—a relic of the priileges of the
old chialry— London Standard
Retailers of Fine Sandmt
In the shop of n cabinetmaker in
New York a sign announces "sawdust
for sale" There is no eidence any
where of the bags of coarse pine saw
dust such as is used in butchers' shops,
markets and saloons
"We don't handle that stuff," said
the proprietor of the shop "Our spe
cialty is in the sawdust of fine woods,
such as mahogany, boxwood and san
dalwood We sell sawdust by the
ounce or the pound, not by the bushel
The sawdust of fine hard woods brings
good prices There are about twele
arietiesjof it, a nd _ each_has_ltß_apji
proprlate use
 "Boxwood sawdust, the most expen
sie of all, is used by manufacturers
to burnish siler plate and jewelry
Sandalwood is used for scent bags and
for the preseration of furs There is
no waste of sawdust in our business"

When Rubles Come From
The rubj mine 3Jn Burma are of four
kinds, the most aluable being gullies
formed by the action of water on the
side of the hills Next to these come
the shafts, or tunnels, sunk in the hill
sides; and then the wells These last
fire sunk in the alley, and are of two
sorts The deep wells are sunk to
fifteen or twenty feet, and the shallow
ones only reach to four feet, whero
the first ruby bearing stratum is found
Rubles, or rather red stones of all
sorts, are offered for sale in large num
bers and  at eery conceiable price
The inhabitants are well off, the min
ers being either Shans, in their enor
mous broad brimmed straw hats and
baggy trousers, or Chinamen, in indigo
blue
Oar ebt to sia
It is noteworthy that out of sia
came our alphabet and our rabic nu
merals The compass we owe to the
