The lesson of he presen srike of mine employes is he
dauger of employing a preponderance of ignoran workers of
auy one class or naiiy There is no danger i employ

ha a man of inelligence depends upon his own judgmen,
and canno be swayed by he clamor of he muliude In
almos eery issue ha arises, he senimen of hose who

a business of going abou seeking whom hey may deour,

The grounds on which ho new rial
is ordorod are ha Judgo W 13
Nuer, be rial judge, did no allow

ha i nl ly 1,200 objecions were noed
 in he rial
The decision ses forh ba during
ho ompaneliug of he jury he cour
ordered a special enire of 75 Tbe

of be bias and prejudice o sheriff
Sibley The eidence showed ba
be sberif bad been gahering eid
ecne and "had hus come o ener
ain an unqualified opinion ba he
defendan was guily" So far as he
challenge for bias is concerned, he
sberif in such a case is pu by he
law precisely in be posiion of a
rial juror and a sae of mind which
would disqualify a juror equally dis
qualifies be sheriff
In reference o cerain loe leers

In be rial i deeloped ba be
defendan, when she was Kmma Colo,
aged 16, married Charles liarro,

The prosecuion urged as a moie
for be murder ba she bad killed

do it.. VVUeu men's clothes don't fit
tbe idea ia conveyed tbat somebody
is trying to save money in the wrong
