The dedicaion in June of a mag

of he highes significance in he his
ory of his religious body
Buil as he resul of a sponaneous
recogniion of Mrs Eddy's life work and
of he imperaie demands of he mar
elous growh of he moemen, ex
pressing he liberaliy of housands of
Chrisian Scieniss, and embodying
he bes in archiecural design and
modern consrucion, his new building
was logically he cenral feaure of
his year's gahering
The church is one of he larges, If
no he larges in he Unied Saes,
is seaing capaciy being 5,012 Is
syle of archiecure is Ialian Renais
sance The pews and oher inerior
finishings are of mahogany The
 alls are Concord granie and Bedford
sone, wih beauiful decoraie car

o harmonize wih he Bedford sone
columns supporing he dome The
heigh of he building o he op of he

han Bunker Hill monumen The
dome is eighywo fee in diameer
and is coered wih erra coa o
mach he Bedford sone The build
ing presens a saely, dignified and
Impressie appearance, and i Is al
ready recognized as one of he land
marks of Boson
The cos of he building is some
hing less han $2,000,000 The new
chimes consis of eleen bells, he
larges of which weighs ,000 pounds
The smalles bell weighs 00 pounds
The organ is one of he larges and
fines in he world
The original "Moher Church" which
adjoins he new building seas abou

are required o accomodae he aend
ance I is said ha when his edifice

was planned some of he members
were disurbed on accoun of is size
They hough ha he proision of so
large an audiorium was enirely un
called for, he aendance a ha ime

Mrs Eddy, organized he Firs
Church of Chris, Scienis, in Boson
in 1879 wih wenysix members So
slow was he growh of he moemen
a firs ha in ISB9, en years laer,
here were only eleen churches
From ha ime, howeer, he increase
was more rapid In 1899, here were
301 churches There are now 657
churches and 275 socieies no ye or
ganized as churches, making 032 so
cieies holding church serices In
1889 here were only 50 members in
he enire connecion In 189 he
oal membership was 2536 Fie
years laer i had reached 18,13
These figures show ha he principal
growh has aken place during he

The dedicaory exercises were a
ended by isiors from all pars of
he Unied Saes and Canada, from
Grea Briain, usralia, Sweden, en

he Hawaiian Islands, Souh merica
and oher foreign counries
One hundred and foryfie church

said ha when funds are no longer

Uncle Sam has recenly inauguraed
a unique and ingenious projec in con
necion wih his Indian wards — or
a leas he mos populous diision
of hem This is nohing less han a
scheme for renaming eery chief and
brae, eery squaw and papoose of
he Sioux ribe The objec of his
wholesale rechrisening Is o insure he
righ descen of propery, somehing
ha has been aended wih much
difficuly under he old condiion of
affairs when he Sioux had no family
name, and each redskin could be
idenified only by his own indiidual
fanciful name, a cognomen which mos
likely had no he slighes resemb
lance o hose of any of his relaies
The renaming of he 25,000 mem
bers of he Sioux Indian ribe was or
dered by Presiden Rooseel on he
adice of Hamlin Garland and George
Bird Grinnell, well known auhors,
and oher persons who hae made a
sudy of he needs of he Indians
To decide upon he r naming was
howeer an easy maer in comparison

ized from he ouse ha i would be
one hing o gie he Indians new
names and quie anoher o induce he
sons and daughers of he fores —
eer suspicious of he whie men — o
accep and use hese new names
Howeer, he Grea Faher a Washing
on was forunae enough o enlis he
cooperaion of r Charles lexander

and clergyman, who is a fullblooded
Sioux, and who came ino naional
prominence some ime since when he
married Elane Goodale, he alened
young New England poeess  he
Presiden's soliciaion r Easman,
who is considered he bes educaed
Indian in he world, agreed o person

Jus wha his responsibiliy mean
will be beer undersood when I is
explained ha no only was r Eas

he Sioux ribe and personally besow

en he new names Jus imagine
selecing gien names for 25,000 per
sons of boh sexes and apporioning
perhaps half as many or one hird as
many differen family names in ad

In his porion of his noel mission
ary work for Uncle Sam he Name
Gier, as he Sioux now erm heir
educaed ribesman, has displayed rare
judgmen and a fine regard for family
hisory and radiion among he Sioux
— a houghfulness ha has done
much o win he good will of hese
inelligen bu conseraie Indians
for he new projec Wheneer pos
sible he has perpeuaed an Indian's
old name in his new one For insance
High Eagle becomes Mr Higheagle,
Bobailed Coyoe was changed o
Rober T Wolf, and Roen Pumpkin
has been ransformed ino Rober

r Easman has been making a
round of all he Sioux reseraions
which are locaed for he mos par
in he akoas and elsewhere in he
Norhwes When he arries a a

The day had no been a rich one for

"Mighy slimlooking, hey, Red?"
In reply Reddy drew up one side of

and wih a one uerly new o him,
said sernlyPersonal
"Look here, Red! You and I's
friends — ha's all righ; bu as sure
as I'm a hief, his here ain' no suff

For an answer Red hrus his hands
ino his pockes, eying Jim curiously
he while, and urned on one foo wih
a long low whisle
"I neer had no moher," murmured
Jim "She died when I was a lile
chap, so I neer knew her, bu i mus
be awfully nice for a feller o hae
a moher like ha o be good o him,
and learn him hings Why, who

These words of regre upon he pas
of his young life, and he expressed
desire for somehing beer, from one
whose only home almos since In
fancy had been he sree, and whose
companions had been crooks and
ne'erdowells, was oo much for he
incorrigible Reddy, whose worship
consised of heroes ha were daring

He could hardly suppress his con

The habi of years could no be

forward, and in a second his fingers
would hae been on he bunch of
paper money which he eil eye of
Reddy "spoed" in he old man's
pocke Like a flash came he sigh
of he purse, he gray lock of hair, he
words in he newspaper ha made
such an impression upon him — no, he
would no, he could no any more
His hand dropped o his side The
old man disappeared wih he money,
safe from Jimmy's wicked fingers
Jim's head sank unil his chin resed
upon his naked ches, his companion
glaring a him wih eyes furious wih
anger
"Well, 'ain no use," said Jim,

In he new Year Book of he e

is a descripion by  J Crosby, of he
ofiice of Experimen Saions, which
shows, in a number of insances, wha
splendid resuls are being aained
hrough he inroducion of common
sense agriculural sudies in some of
he counry illage schools, and how
hey direcly affec and benefi heir
home owns There is wha appears
o be, an almos ideal Pennsylania
illage high school, which he wrier
isied He describes wha he sawPersonal
In Erie Couny, Pa, surrounded by
a good general farming and dairy
counry, is he illage of Waerford,
on he ouskirs o€ which is he sie of
For le Boeuf, of French and India
war fame  Waerford he firs
school in Erie Couny was esablish 1
in 1800, and here as far back as 1822
was ereced a sone academy build
in ir which is used oday as he rfain
par of he highschool building The
ownship of Waerford has a popula
ion of 1,60 and abou one haii re
side in he borough of Waerfd Tr»
borough has is own elemenary
school, bu he high school is suppor
ed and conrolled joinly by he bor
ough and ownship
This high school, wih is hree
eachers and hree courses of sudy
(language, scienific, and agriculural),
has an enrollmen of 80 pupils, and 35
of hese are in he agriculural course
This course includes agriculure, fie
hours a week for four years The
work of he firs year is deoed o a
sudy of plan life — germinaion, plan
growh, plan food, reproducion, prop
agaion, ransplaning, pruning, and
use of plans; he second year o a
sudy of field, orchard, and garden
crops; he hird year o domesic ani
mals, dairying, and s»U physics, a~ 1
he fourh year o he chemisry of
soils and of plan and animal life
Tex books are used in he class
rooms; a small library of agriculural
reference books, repors and bulleins
of his eparmen and experimen
saions, and agriculural papers con
ribued by he publishers is in almos
consan use, and lecures on agricul
ural subjecs are gien before he
class and before he whole school by
he insrucor in agriculure, who is
an agriculural college graduae Bu
he feaure of insrucion which
chiefly disinguishes his agriculural
course from he ordinary high school
course is he prominence gien o he
laboraory work and he oudoor prac
icum For he laboraory work here
is no elaborae apparaus The pupils
make much of heir own apparaus,
furnish heir own reagen boles, and,
moreoer use hem In he planlife
course he pupils sudy no elaborae
and carefully prepared drawings, bu
he plans hemseles wih reference
o heir life hisory and economic uses
For he oudoor pracicum he
school is unforunae in haing
neiher land nor domesic animals nor

good farm wihin a radius of 3 or 
miles, nearly eery barn and poulry
yard in he illage, he bucher shops,
and he farm implemen sores furnish
cosly illusraie maerial and exend

good lie sock eiher bring her ani

barns and fields for his purpose I
is said o be a rare hing for a good

Thfe wrier was forunae in being

Ocober and in haing an opporuniy

indeed surprising  he close of he

Homeerof and Craf
The "homeerof" idea, referred o by
George H Maxwell in his address be
fore he Biennial Conenion of he
General Federaion of Women's Clubs,
is closely allied o he "home ars and
crafs" propaganda, in which so many,
in and ou of he federaion, are iner
esed The homecrofer, owning his
home and a lile pach of ground — an
acre or wo, more or less — is of all
persons he one mos likely o be iner
esed in home crafs — lile lines of
manufacure, which, added o he pro
duce of his ground, may afford a sup
por o his family, eiher consanly or
as a subsiue for wageearning em
ploymen when some grea shop or
facory may be suspended ided,
perhaps, by a lile gas engine or elec
ric moor, he may hae a choice of an
infinie ariey of crafs, o which he
and his family may profiably engage
Here is a combinaion which seems o
offer relief from he demoralizing and
deializing condiions of our presen
facory sysem; also a mode of muli
plying he number of hose ciizens,
independen of boh landlord and em
ployer, who are he backbone of

nd so lleyne found himself no
only chosen as squire o a knigh, bu
also as squire o hree damozels, which
was een furher from he par which
he had hough o play in he world
nd now here came a ime of sir

when he marches of Picardy and Nor

In he ancien and populous couny

which promised eiher honor or profi
Greaes of all he musers, howeer,

from he ancien Hampshire houses, all
were pushing for Chrischurch o ake

nd now, could Sir Nigel hae shown

of rank required, he migh well hae

which, joined o he hree hundred e

would make a force which any leader
migh be proud o command Care
fully and sagaciously he eeran

swarm of oluneers Many an anxious
consulaion he held wih Black Simon,
Sam ylward, and ohers of his more

Sain's ay, howeer, he had filled up
his full numbers, and musered under

red lion of S George upon he cenre
of he breas When all was compleed
and he muser called in he casle

were men who had followed he wars

Six long weeks were aken in hese

There was cruely in i, doubless, and

"You would dare!" said she "You

"You would dare!" repeaed he lady,
in a choking oice "You, a graceless

She had spoken wih a rising oice

Heyne sared openeyed a his

" I know i," she cried; "I am a mos

A New Potato Culture.
A queer tale In agriculture comes by
way of Chicago. It is stated that a
half-bushel of sawdust, a dash of
chemical solution and fifteen potatoes
carefully enveloped with the sawdust
will enable the average householder to
grow a bushel of tubers on his house
top or in his cellar within sixty days.
This process has been discovered and
elaborated by W. D. Darst, of Great
Falls, Mont Moreover, the grower
will have no potato bugs to contend
with, no turning over of the soil at
certain intervals, and no contest with
worms.
'..'ae product of Mr Darst's process
is termed the "vineless potato" from
the fact that, grown under these ap
parently unnatural conditions, there is
no surface vegetation, because of
which, each potato buried in the saw
dust is enabled to produce at least
twelve normal-sized tubers.
Recently at the Oakland Plaza, la
the rear of the Oakland Hotel, Mr.
Darst disclosed the methods of grow
ing potatoes by his system. Operating
on the theory that the presence of sur
face vegetation was only a method of
securing nourishment and in reality
sapped the vitality of the tuber, Mr.
Darst experimented more than six
years and found he could overcome
this seemingly natural course on the
part of the plant by supplying it arti
ficially with its needs.
By employing sawdust, peat, straw,
or any other earth product that would
permit of the circulation of air, moist
ure and heat, and by applying solutions
of various fertilizers, discovered
that a single potato would multiply
itself by attaching to itself from
twelve to sixteen other potatoes of
approximately the same dimensions
without throwing off any of its energy
above ground.
Packed in loosely arranged bins per
mitting the free access of air and ar
ranged in rows six inches above each
other, with an allowance of one cubic
foot of sawdust to the seedling, Mr.
Darst has demonstrated the rapidity
of growth and the proportions that the
potatoes may attain by showing th.;t
within sixty days fifteen potatoes will
produce a bushel. In the character of
his experiments and the success that
has attended them Mr. Darst, it is
stated, has the indorsement of Luther
Burbank, the eminent horticulturist
and botanist. — From Chicago Record
Herald.
Counterfeit Blossoms.
When the dogwood is in bloom in
the spring woods, he would be a very
unobservant traveler who did not
know it; yet it is questionable if one
out of fifty of the multitude of people
who come home from their country
walks with their arms full of snowy
branches has ever noticed the real
flowers of this beautiful tree, a
matter of fact, what are commonly re
garded as the petals of the dogwood
are no part of the floral structure at
all, but merely four large white leaves,
which, during the winter, served as
protective wrappers to the flower buds.
The real flowe:s are about the size of
shoe-pegs, of greenish color and are
bunched several together in a small
cluster in the midst of the four white
leaves, and if observed at all by the
average wild flower gatherers, are
iiistaken for stamens.
So, too. with the flowers of the
pretty "painted cup," which when it
blossoms in May frequently makes
whole meadows rosy with brilliant
color. Plucking one, we may think we
are looking at a pike of gorgeous,
flame-colored flowers, while the fact
is that the striking effect is produced
entirely by numerous reddened leaves
intermingled with the real flowers
which are as plain as Cindere s
sisters and practically hidden from
sight.
Indeed, so fond is Mother Nature of
befooling her unobservant devotees
that she has caused one whole family
of plants to be given over to this make
believe habit of flowering. To it be
long that favorite little preacher of the
April wood — Jack-in-the-pulpit; the

patterdock and pickerel weed the
muddy margins of shallow streams;
the skunk cabbage, and that aristo
crat of the greenhouse, the Immacu
late calla lily. With all these the
flowers are unrecognizable in them
selves as such, except by the initiated,
being minute and crowded on a fleshy
spike.
Another pay deceiver is the poin
setta of the hot-house. In this case it
Is a circlet of scarlet leaves which
popular estimation rates as a flower,
while the poor little real blossom
clustered in the midst of these robbers
of their good name live and die unap
preciated. Relatives of the poinsetta
are the wild spurges of our sandy
fields.. The flowers of many of these,
inconspicuous in themselves, are sim
ilarly provided with relatively showy
appendages, deceiving all but studentr.
The Department of Agriculture has
recently published a bulletin coutaiu
lng suggestions for constructing a
model dairy barn. It has been the
endeavor of the Department to plan
a barn embodying the best ideas In
sclemilic and sanitary construction
that cm consistent w.l.i practicability
and cheapness, and it is believed the
rt;.;ult accomplished by the plan pub
lished will help the dairyman to get
the best products from his cows In the
most economical manner.
The plan is designed for 24 cows,
nnd allows ample room for calf pens
and box stalls for bull and cows; also

room and silo. In presenting the plan

Department to insist that the arranpe

Important features often overlooked
by the builder and which are vita!
to a well-planned structure.
The amount of space allowed for
the various purposes named on the
plan is thought to meet the require
ments so far as the square feet of
floor space is concerned. The ar
rangement of the space can be adapted
to the needs of the particular location.
The design calls for a width of 36
feet 4 Inches outside. There are two
main reasons for adontiner this width;

first, it allows ample room for the
stalls and passageways, and, second,
It permits of the most economical use
of lumber in building. The lengtn
shown is 84 feet, but this feature is
wholly dependent on the number of
cows the dairyman wishes to handle.
One of the weakest joints in barn con
struction is the small amount of win
dow space usually allowed. This error
is rectified by the Department in this
plan by allowing approximately 6
square feet for each cow.

tained by application to the Depart

Clean Food
Era
We are inclined to believe that some magazine writers in their anxiety te
attract attention to themselves have overstated the case against the meat packers.
We do not sell meat but believe in fair play, and also in a complete knowledge,
by the people, of exactly what they are eating.
We have always printed on each and every pkg. of
Grape -Nuts
Food
exactly what it is made of and the scores of visitors who pass through our works
every day find the Pure Food Factories as clean and sweet as a maiden's fresh white
apron. The food is thoroughly cooked in these factories from the choicest white
wheat and barley, the sweet offering of the fields.
No food on earth gives the same sustaining
power from meal to meal as Grape -Nuts»
BECAUSE—
The starchy parts of the wheat and barley are changed by moisture and heat
to a form of sugar required by the human system and almost immediately absorbed
without stress to the digestive machinery. And again, the certain elements in these
grains are incorporated to insure rebuilding of the soft gray matter in the brain and
nerve centres to fit one for the wearing work of the day. A dish of Grape-Nuts and
Cream at each meal supplies the GO and you can feel it in a way that leaves no
question. It is not stimulation but simply scientific feeding.
