THE MINE ELECTION
The poliical oulook, judging from he resul of he

from a republican sandpoin The democras eleced Plaised
goernor, wo ou of four congressmen, and claim he legis
laure on join ballo, which will gie hem one Unied Saes
senaor from ha sae No for hiry years hae he demo
cras scored such a success in ha sae The republicans
while expecing a reducion i he pary oe, were surprised
a he magniude of he democraic icory Opinions differ
as o he cause of his hereofore reliable republican sae
breaking loose from is oldime poliical moorings The
, siuaion is similar' o ha which preceded he elecion of
Cleeland in 188 The long period of uninerruped ascen
dancy of any pary gies birh in he minds of many o a
desire for a change The fac ha he counry has enjoyed
prosperiy during his period is no srong enough o oer
come his yearning for change, paricularly when fanned by
parisan appeals ha a change of adminisraion will bring
beer imes The facional srife wihin he republican ranks
represened byhe sruggle beween he insurgens and regu
lars, has probably dampened he pary spiri more han all
he effors of democracy combined When one wing of a po
liical pary akes issue wih he conrolling facion on a
ial quesion of policy, like he ariff for insance, he effec
canno be oherwise han bewildering and harmful In face
of his warning oice from Maine, i behooes republicans
o sop heir bickerings, and work harmoniously o carry he
Noember elecions The paramoun quesion now is, no
whebiier insurgen or regulars shall conrol he republican
pary, bu wheher republicans or democras shall conrol
he nex congress The drif of he elecions so far is aderse
o he pary now in conrol There is a feeling abroad ha
a change in pary majoriy in congress would make lile
difference o he oiling masses anyway, and would no dis

coneying he idea ha he bank was

when i became known ha here was
no he slighes basis for uneasiness ;
ha he bank was as sound as any in

o mee any emergency  The rumor
was floaed o Jackson, and inquiries
were made a he paren bank, bu
nohing in he shape of a demand for

Indeed, he deposis amouned o more

Smoke Signals
The raeler on he plains in he
early duys soon learned he signifi
cance of he spires of smoke ha he
someimes saw rising from a disan
ri3ge or hill, and answered from a
differen direcion I was he signal
alk of he Indians across miles of in
erening ground, a signal used in
rallying he warriors for an aack, or
warning hem for a rerea
The Indian had a way of Bending he
smoke up in rings or puffs, knowing
ha such a smoke column would a
once be noiced and undersood as a
signal and no misaken for he smoke
of some camp fire He made his rings
by coering he lile fire wih his
blanke for a momen and allowing he
smoke o ascend, says Harper's Week
ly The column of ascending  smoke
rings said o eery Indian wihin
hiry milesPersonal "Beware! n enemy is
near!" Three smokes buil close o
geher mean "anger" One smoke
merely mean "enion" Two
Bmokes mean "Camp a his place"
Frequenly a nigh he seler or
he raeler saw fiery lines crossing
he sky shooing up and falling, per
haps aking a direcion diagonal o he
lines of ision He migh guess ha
hese were he signals of he Indians,
bu unless he were an oldimer he
migh no be able o inerpre he sig
nals The oldimer and he squaw
man know ha one fire arrow, an
arrow prepared by reaing he head
of he shaf wih gunpowder and fine
bark, means he same as hree
columns of smoke puffs" n enemy,
is near " Two arrows mean "an
ger," hree arrows, "The danger is

"The enemy is oo powerful for us"

Peach Culure
We las week gae a noice of some

duc of he garden of C M Meek, in
Jackson These samples were no
only of large size bu as fine in flaor
as any we hae eer ased  pecu
liar feaure of his maer remains
o be old The ree from which his
frui was plucked was planed many
years ago, and while i grew srong
and healhy, he frui neer amouned
o anyhing I was looked upon as a
useless ree as far as frui bearing
qualiies are concerned The big fire
which desroyed he Meek residence,
ogeher wih oher buildings, scorched
his paricular ree o such an exen
as o kill one half of i The oher
half, howeer, seemed o hrie on
his bapism of fire, and las year he
ree yielded 200 pounds of peaches—
no he insipid and unpalaable frui
of former years, bu fine, luscious,
richflaored frui ha would com
mand a good price in any marke
Thi year he ree is also well loaded
wih he same kind of frui Now he
quesion arises, wha was here in
his scorching of hree summers ago o
change his hen worhless ree ino a
fruibearing ree ha would be
crediable o any orchards? Was i
acually purified by fire? id he
scorching kill he poor qualiies of he
ree, and leae he good qualiies no
only unimpaired, bu of increased
ialiy? Or was i he ferilizing
ashes of he fire ha pu he elemens
in he soil ha made he wonderful
difference This is a problem worh
soling by hose conducing scienific

The facs are jus as we hae saed,
and he cause is worhy of careful

conered ino aluable fruibearing

anage in he legislaure hrough his

ing eery measure presened in he

careful aenion possible by my fel
lowmembers of he sae senae and
myself in a general desire o safe
guard he axpayers o he inerior
agains possible wase or misuse of
he fund creaed by heir combined
assisance
I hink his has been done sais
facorily in he measure which he
oers of he sae will be asked o
approe a he general elecion in
Noember To begin wih, during
he enire erm of operaion of his
consiuional amendmen he ax will
be leied upon eery kind and
characer of propery in he sae of
California, including railroad or any
oher corporae or priae propery,
which wna subjec o axaion on July
lfi^, 1010 Secondly, here is creacn
he sae reasury a special fund, o lie
known as he Panamai'acific Iner
naional ESxoiUion fund, ino which
all moneys colleced from his axley
are o be paid; nn;l s proidsd
ha he sae legislaure shall pres
cribe he imp, manner, erms and

hereafer for he purpose of disburs
ing his fund, where conracs ami

how of n iepor3 shall be made nnd
wha disposiion /shall bo made of any

Ine axpayers of he sae are fur
her safeguarded by a proision
auhorizing he sae commission o
make such propsr conracs wih he
exposiion company as will enile he
sae of California o share equally
wih subscribers o he sock of he
company in any reurns from he ex
posiion In his way, he sae ir
ually becomes a "sockholder in he
enerprise wihou a sockholder's

I am of he opinion ha he people
of California should no be afraid o
oe his axley a he polls in No
ember Under Consiuinal mend
men No 1, drawn by myself nnd of
which I sood sponsor a he las re
gular session of he sae legislaure,
here will be d separaion of sae and

serice corporaions will be axed up
oi heir gross receips; always pro
ided he oers of he sae approe
his proposed consiuional amend
men a he polls in Noember By
he applicaion of a percenage of he
gross receips as he basis of axaion,
he sae of California will ge he
benefi, of is percenage of any grea
increase of business deried by rail
roads and oher public serice corpora
ions, so ha for eery $100 earned by
a railroad during he progress of he
exposiion, he sae will receie $00,
a greaer percenage han could be
obained hrough he old sysem of
physical aluaion Had his amend
men been in force in 1909 here would
hae resuled more reenue ; for he
enire axley bill as passed a he
las session proided no raise
I call he aenion of he people,
herefore, o he legal fac ha his
ax for he proposed exposiion will be
he only ad alorem ax hey will be
called upon o pay during he operaion
of he proposed consiuional amend
men

he opinion ha he Panama Pacific

•©•••• ••election on the question of establish
ing a county high on the day prior to
the general election. It is contended
that the two elections on succeeding
days— 7th nnd Bth November— will be
apt to Interfere one with the other.
The only plea that has been advanced
for this fiction by the supervisors is
that it will save the expense of one
distribution of electric booths and
supplies. One trip over the county
will answer for both elections. This
seems to be running the economy itfea
into the ground. The few dollars saved
by thia arrangement does not begin to
offset the inconvenience of the voters
occassioned thereby. Certainly voters
distant from a polling place are not
likely to make the two trios necessary
to cast a ballot at both elections.
Arrested in
Calaveras County.
Bert Hancock was arrested at Camp
Seco last Monday, on a warrant issued
by W. L. Rose, justice of the peace
at Sutter Creek, on complaint of his
wife, charging him with neglecting to
provide for his family. The warrant
was served by the authorities of Calu
veras county, and the accused was
lodged in jail at San Andreas. Sheriff
Gregory went over there Tuesday, and
brought the defendant to Jackson, and
placed him . in the county jail. On
Wednesday he was taken to Sutter
Creek to answer to the charge.
Some time ago Hancock was married
to Mrs Frout, who was a resident of
this town for several years. She was
• then a widow, with several children,'
two of who were minors, between ten
and fifteen years of age. After a
time the family returned to this
county, living at Sutter Creek, Han
cock securing work at the South
■ Eureka mine. According to his ac
count, after receiving his pay he went
around and paid his bills, as far as the
money would go. This was his habit,
as he wished to deal honestly with all.
A difference arose between him and
his wife on financial matters, and he
left some three weeks ago. Pie ob
tained work at the copper mine at
Camp Seco, and had been worKing
there about a week when arrested on
this charge. It is said he had not re
tteived any pay up to that time. The
affair has given birth to a good deal of
unfavorable , comment. Hancock has
no children of his own.
Deafness Can not ue Cured
by local applications as they cannot
reach the diseased portion of the ear)
Thero is only ono way to cure deafness
and that is by constitutional remedies.
Deafness is caused by an inflamed con
dition of the mucous "lining: of the Eus
tachian Tube. When this tube is in
flamed you have :i rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing 1 , and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can; oe
taken out and this tube restored to its
normal condition, hearing will be de
stroyed forever! nino cases out of ten
are caused by Catarrh, which is 'noth
ing but an inflamed condition of the
mucous surfaces.
We will gi\» One Hundred Dollars
or any ca?o of Deafness (caused by ca
tarrh) thai cannot be cured by Hall's
Catarrh Cure. Send for circulars, free.

Primary Election Cost
The cost of the late primary election
in Amador county was approximately
$3500. While this is a heavy toll for
simply furnishing candidates for the
various offices to be filled by election,
it is moderate •in comparison with
some counties. In Sacramento the
expense run up to $20,000. When the
cost per capita is considered, however,
Amador stands pretty well up to the
top of the list. There were less than
1500 votes cast in this county, so that
the cost per vote was about $2.50.
The aggregate cost was considerably
more than at a general election— state
or presidential. The next legislature
will no doubt amend the law so as to
make more economical as well as more
efficient. Taxpayers will not be satis
fied to pay so heavily for simply nam
ing candidates for office.
Don't Break Down.
Severe strains on the vital organs,
like strains on machinery, cause
break-downs. You can't over-tax
stomach, liver, kidnej'3, bowels or
nerves without serious danger to your
self; If you are weak or run down, or
under strain. of any kind, take Electric
Bittevs the matchle33, tonic medicine.
Mrs J. E. Van de Sande.of Kirkland,
111., writes: "That I did not break
down, while enduring a most severe
strain, for three months, is due wholly
to Electric Bitters. " Use them and
enjoy health and strength. Satisfac
tion positively guaranteed. 50 cents
at Spairnoli's'drusr store.
