RISING THE SLOON LICENSE
The inroducion of au ordinance before he board of ciy
rusees o increase he reail liquor license from $15 o $5
per quarer came as a surprise o he ciizens generally Few
were aware ha any such moe was in conemplaion I was
unheralded by any discussion of he subjec pro and con
The acion is no based on any peiion of propery or busi
ness men, which is he usual course when any radical change
is proposed in he conduc of municipal affairs Trusees are
supposed o reflec he senimens of heir consiuens, bu
he Ledger is unable o explain he rue inwardness of his
change of he license sysem, eiher as regards he moies
behind i or he objec sough o be accomplished hereby
The proposiion has been he subjec of a grea deal of dis
cussion, and he iews expressed are widely diergen I is
admied ha he saloon business is oerdone, boh in Jack
son and hroughou he couny Saloons hae been fosered
and encouraged by a sysem of low license exending oer a
period of many years, he increase being gradual s a
general proposiion, s conceded ha high license is he
mos pracicable mehod of regulaing he liquor raffic The
suberfuge of rying o limi he number under a low ariff
has proen exaious and unsaisfacory in eery way Bu
conceding his, he wisdom of rushing a he hing blind
fold and hurriedly is iewed wih serious misgiings by
many I is no a simple maer of geing rid of half a
dozen saloons more or less, bu he disurbance of propery
alues ha mus necessarily flow from any iolen shif of
policy, ha impars graiy o he siuaion Jackson was
iocorporaed less han hree years ago under an implied, if
no express, pledge ha business ineress would no be
menaced by any maerial increase of license In oher words
ciy licenses would be graded o conform wih couny licenses
Jackson is no now, and has no been for years, enjoying any
hing like a boom The demand for business houses in he
business secion is fully supplied ny radical sep ha
would suddenly drie a number of saloous ou of business
should be, well pondered oer before decisie acion is aken
I is a long way from being he simple problem ha I looks
The business cener is he pulsaing hear of auy own Srike
a he hear and he whole communiy mus suffer Vacan
business premises mean a loss of populaion, and umbling of
rens, wih he ineiable resul of a general depreciaion of
propery alues, and a corresponding shrinkage of he assess
men roll, and curailmen of ciy and couny reenue de
ried from direc propery axes So ha if increased reenue
is he ulimae aim he oucome is ap o briug bier disap
poinmen This is he iew aken by he conseraie,
hinking elemen
On he oher hand, some, who ake an exclusiely moral
iew of he subjec, will commend and applaud any moe ha
squins in he direcion of lessening he saloon eil I is
purely a senimenal quesion wih hem, separaed from he
economical and ciic iew s a rule hey are no propery
holders, and hae lile esed ineress o be jeopardized
They are sincere enhusiass, and would hail he absolue
prohibiion of he liquor raffic a one fell swoop, regardless
of is immediae consequences, as a reform icory of he
highes imporance Bu s cerain ha he proposed
jump in he license ax was no aken a heir reques or ou
heir iniiaie
I canno be'denied ha some would be benefied The
score or so of saloon men who would be able o mee he
rebled oll, would expec o be more han repaid by he in
creased business which hey calculae would come from he
knockou of compeing esablishmens This aspec is so
uerly selfish ha i will fail o command he respec of auy
oue ouside of he few beueficiares concerned Surely he
goerning body of auy ciy would scorn o be influenced by
appeals promped by such a spiri In he absence of any
peiion calling for a radical deparure from he exising
policy, more or less wild sree alk is bound o be indulged
in The Ledger beliees ha he majoriy should rule, and
russ his maer — which is a ruly delicae one — will be
fully discussed by our ciizens generally, and aced upon
inelligenly, wih he sole iew of promoing he ciy's wel

REGULR REPUBLICNS THE VICTORS
 he primaries held las Tuesday hroughou he sae,
compulsory in all ciies haing a populaion of en housand

figh was o elec delegaes o he sne aiid 'disric conen

hereby elec one of heir own crowd as Unied Saes senaor
o succeed Perkins There was a bushel of selfishness for
eery grain of disineresedness in he league moemen,
and as he criical ime drew near he oers began o ge
heir eyes open o he moies promping he league manipu
laors The leaguers were sucessful in Berkeley, Oakland,
Fresno, Humbokl, San Luis Obispo, and maybe Conra
Cosa, wih, he balance of he sae lined up almos solidly
agains hem I is well he republican oers jumped on
he moemen wih boh fee, and flaened i ou so horough
ly ha s no likely o gie any furher rouble during he
campaign Now ha he poliical amosphere has been
cleared of his oerhanging cloud, republicans will be able
o ge ogeher aud work harmoniously o roll up an old
ime majoriy for Taf aud Sherman
esrucie fores fires hae been uncommonly numerous

causing an immense loss in he desrucion of propery oher

in face of he presen sringen sae and federal laws lor
proecion of foress, aud he presence of an armj' of rangers
o enforce he laws and guard agains fires, ha hese sweep
ing conflagraions should be apparenly increasing insead of
decreasing I should be remembered, howeer, ha we hae
had a phenomenally longconinued ho spell, following an
unusually dry winer uring excepionally ho summers
i would be somehing ou of he ordinary if brush fires were
no more frequen han under oher circumsances Their
occurrence' does no necessarily imply inefficiency on he par
of officials charged wih he oersigh of such maers nd
such fires are no always aribuable o he carelessness of
campers or huners Naure herself can, aud does, play
he role of incendiary under cerain condiions Sill here
can be no quesion ha mos of hem are brough abou by
human agency, wih carelessness as a leading facor When
hey do occur, howeer, officials and priae ciizens should
work ogeher harmoniously under some inelligen head for
heir exinguishmen When he fire fiend is abroad in his
fury, s no ime o haggle oer redape rules issued from
Washingon Hard, common sense is an infiniely beer
reliance han a olume of general rules issued housands of
miles from he danger lines In Calayeras couny much
fricion is repored o hae occurred beween he fores serice
officials and local firefighers The laer waned o back
fire in accordance wih mehods which long experience had
augh hem o be mos effecie The officers, on he oher
hand, waned o adhere sricly o he formulaed rule ha
backfires should no be sared a a greaer disance han
sixy fee from he fire line If such a rule does exis, s
abou as absurd as anyhing ha could be imagined, and
men would necessarily hae o expose hemseles o fearful
risks in aemping o comply wih i n official in com
mand of a firefighing crew should 'hae full discreionary
powers, and no be hampered by anyhing in he shape of
redapeism
Judging from he showing made a he primaries his week
he democraic pary in California is no going o much of r
