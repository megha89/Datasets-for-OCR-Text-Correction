SASH WINOWS
fr*w>baPersonal i utch Inention of the
 enteenth Century
The history of sash wiodows is some
what obscure, but Personal probability is
that they were a utch inention and
that they were introduced into Eng
land soon after the reolution of 168&
The deriation of the word "sash" In
♦ills sense is the utch "sas," a sluice
old Euglish "sasse" In Queen Anne's
reign they were yet so comparatiely
uncommon as to be mentioned as a
special feature of houses that were
adertised as "To let" In the Tatler,
for instance, No 178, May 2730, 1710,
there is this adertisementPersonal
"To be lett, in eonshire Square,
near Bishopsgate, a ery good Brick
House of 3 Rooms of a Floor, and a
good Hall, with ery good light and
dark Closets, the whole House being
well wainscoted, and snsh'd with 30
Bash Lights, a ery pleasant aud con
enient Office below Stairs," etc /
Prom England they passed into
Prance, where the first to put them up
was Marshal de Lorge at his new
house at 1 Montmartre Speaking of
this Lister in 1C99 writes in his "Jour
ney to ParisPersonal" "We had the good for
tune here to find the marshal himself
He showed us his great sash windows,
how easily they might be lifted up and
down aud stood at any height which
coutriance he said, he had out of
England by a small model brought on
purpose from thence, there 'icing noth
ing of this poise In windows in France

How Water Freezes
It used to puzzle all thinking people
why ponds and riers do not freeze be
yond a certain depth This depends on
a most curious fact— namely, that wa
ter is at its heaiest when it reaches
10 degrees P— that Is, 8 degrees aboe
freezing point On a frosty night as
each top layer of water falls to 40 de
grees it sinks to the bottom; therefore
the whole pond has to drop to 40 de
grees, before any of it can freeze At
last ft is all cooled to this point, and
then ice begins to form But ice is a
ery bad conductor of heat; therefore
it shuts off the freezing air from the
big body of comparatiely warm wa
ter underneath The thicker it gets
the more perfectly, does It act as a
great coat and that is why een the
Arctic ocean neer freezes beyond a
few feet in thickness— Marine Jour

Hani to Get
A certain young fellow receied a
goernment berth, for which he had
to undergo a ery strict examination'
One day a friend of his who had been
noticing how little work he did to earn
his salary tackled him
"I say, Walter, my boy," he began,
"you don't perform a great deal of la
boi* do oiiV"
"No, I don't hae to"
"Aren't you expected to work?"
"Of course not" was the candid re
ply "It takes so much hard work to
get a job like this that the authorities
haen't the nere to ask a man to do
anything more to earn his salary after
he gets it"

PURE SUNLIGHT AN AIR
flnces Here WliUh Shame the Old
AVorld'it FnorPersonal' OimfM
, We hae ofteu heard of "sunny Ita
ij" or the "clear light" of Egypt, says
the esert; but, beliee tne, there is no
unlight there compared with that
, which falls upon the upper peaks of
the Sierra Madre or the uninhabitable
wastes of the Colorado desert
Pure sunlight requires for its ex
istence pure air, and the old world has
little of it left When you are hi
Rome again and stand upon that hill
where all good Romanists go at sun
set look out and see how dense is the
atmosphere between you and St Pe
ter's dome That sanie thick air is all
oer Europe, all around the Mediter
ranean, een oer in Mesopotamia and
by the banks' of the Gauges It has
been breathed and burned and battle
smoked for 10,000 years
Hide, up nnd oer the high tablelands
of Montana— one can still  ride ; there
for days without seeing a trace of hu
manity—and how clear and scentless,
how absolutely intangible, that sky
blown, sunshot atmosphere! You
breathe it without feeling it, you see
through It a hundred miles, and the
picture is not blurred by It Once
more ride oer the enchanted mesas of
Arizona at sunrise or sunset, witli the
ragged mountains of Mexico to the
south of you and the broken spurs of
the great Sierra around about you, and
all the glory of the old shall be as
nothing to the gold and purple and
burning crimson of this new world
Moable ropa In lanionilx
It has loug been known that dia
monds, especially the class known as
"rose diamonds," are likely to explode
if subjected only to what would seem a
ery ordinary degree of heat such as
strong rays from the sun, etc It is
now belieed that the explosions are
the result of the rapid expansion of
certain olatile liquids inclosed in cai
ties near the center of these precious
stones A great many diamonds, een
though cut, mounted and worn as gems
of perfection, are still in an unfinished
condition— that is, the liquid drop from
which the stone is being formed has
not as yet deposited all of its "pure
crystals of carbon" These moable
drops may occasionally be seen with
the naked eye
When this Is the case, a strong mi
croscope will gie the drop the appear
ance of a bubble in the fluid of a car
penter's leel It is also highly prob
able that besides the liquid mentioned
these caities may contain gases under
great tension This being the case,
one may readily comprehend how a
ery small amount of heat would
cause the liquid and gas to expand to
such a degree that the diamond would
gie way with all the characteristics
of a miniature explosion
Something He Had Forgotten
"So you enjoyed your continental
trlp/dld you?" Inquired the simple old
gentleman "I haen't been oer In
fifty years, but my recollections are
still iid I remember once standing
on Mont Blanc, watching the sun sink
behind the blue waters of the Mediter
ranean, while to my right the noble
Rhine rushed onward to the Black sea, 1
and the Pyrenees, still holding the
snows of winter, were on the left I
remember while standing there"—
"But Mr Grey," feebly Interrupted
his listener, "I was on Mont Blanc
myself, and really — you'll excuse me —
but you really must be mistaken in
your geography"
"Mistaken?" returned the old man
lightly "Not a bit of it But I for
got; it's different now You know, my
dear boy, that since my day the entire
map of Europe has been changed by
these awful wars, and so of course you
can't appreciate what it was fifty years
ago"
Ancestry of Shoemaklng
There is nothing ulgar about the
ancestry of the shoeniaking trade In
the United States The first shoemak
er came oer In the Mayflower His
name was Thomas Beard, and he had
an income from the London company
of $100 a year and receied fifty acres
of land on which to settle Seen
years later the city of Lynn was
founded, and eer since it has been
making shoes for the world Philip
Kertland, a natie of Buckingham
shire, was the first ' shoemaker of the
city of Lynn In George Washington's
day Lynn had 200 master workmen
and 600 journeymen shoemakers, turn
Ing out eery year no less than 300,000

KalKutiiie the Elbe
A curious means of moing boats Is
employed on the rier Elbe— a chain
890 miles long at the bottom  of the

In the usual way The boats are ISO
feet long and proided with 200 horse
power steam engines which turn a
drum fastened on the deck The chain
comes In oer the bow, passing along
on rollers to the drum, around which
It is wound three times The chain Is

"J could hae married either Whip
per or Snapper if I'd wanted to, and
both of those men whom I refused
hae since got rich, while you are still
as poor as a church mouse"
He— Of course I'e been supporting
you all these years They haen't
Two Signs
"To snuff a candle out accidentally
la a sign of marriage"
"Yes, and to turn down a lamp inten

BHE HA HER WAY
Vhe Story of m Tmuii Racket and a
Sarcaattc Maiden
She was a demure looking girl, young
and Blight, and her hair clung to her
forehead in babyish little rings  In
her hand fiho held a tennis racket
Three of 'the strings were J'sprung"
She explained to the salesman In the
big sporting goods house that the rack
et was an expensie ope; tnat It had
broken at the first trial; that the fact
of its haing done so Bad caused hr
much annoyance, as she had bought It
for a birthday present r In conclusion
she was here to return it
The salesman noted the ' babyish
curls, and, adopting the manner of a
bored but rather good natured cat to
an irresponsible kitten, he promised to
hae the racket restrung jj
"But I don't want It restrung," said
the girl "I want a new one"
"Olbut I can't gie you a new one,"
said the clerk reproingly "This one
has been used"
"Yes," said the girl meekly; "it has
been used, and therein was my mis
take You see, I fancied I had bought
a tennis racket and so described it to
the recipient He foolishly, belieed
me and used It Had we both known
that your firm was charging $7 for pa
pier mache souenirs fashioned after
the form of a racket, why, he Would
hae put it upon his wall as a decora
tion Yes," she continued politely; "I
admit we erred in using it" Ana she
smiled prettily  
 Then she gae her address and
walked out' The next day the firm
sent a new racket— New York Times
The Rainbow
When a ray of sunlight falls on a
raindrop It is refracted; 'then part of
the light Is reflected from the internal
surface and again refracted on leaing
the drop The white sunlight is not
only refracted when It enters and
leaes the drop, but dispersion also
takes place The eye sees bright cir
cles of light for each kind of light, and
since sunlight is made up of different
kinds cf homogeneous light we get a
series of circular arcs, showing the
spectrum colors, the red being outside
and the other colors following In the
order of descending wae length The
whole constitutes a primary rainbow
A secondary bow is sometimes seen
outside the 'first This is formed by
the light being twice reflected Inside
the raindrops The less refrangible
rays are on the inner side Rainbows
due to still more internal reflections
are too feeble to be obsered It Is
possible to get a white rainbow If the
sun is clouded or If there is a mixture
of raindrops of ery different sizes I
liiKhtning Precaution
An electrical engineer declares that
the center of the room is the safest
place from lightning
"There is a constant tendency on the
part of the electricity in the sky to
reach the ground," he says "To do this
it must hae a conductor Atmos
pheric electricity always follows the
outside of the conductor or agency
that leads it to the ground That's
why the middle of the room is safest
during an electrical storm
"I know of a number of Instances
where a bolt of lightning followed
the walls of a room, burning it on all
four sides, while the people In It being
away from the walls, were only slight
ly shocked That Is the only safe pre
caution known to science" Personal

THE BUYER OF BEEP
He la • Man /Of Oonaa*aao About
the Stockrarda
The buyer occupies a position of con
equence In the stockyards community
Ho Is an expert, usually a man of mid
dle age, who has obtained bis educa
tion and technical ability partly in the
packing houses and partly on the ranch
An experienced buyer Is likely to re
ceie, a salary of fi,ooo to |5/ *0 a
year, and he Is worth all of that for on
his ability to tell by a moment's in
spection what quality of beef will be
produced by a steer that be neer be
fore laid eyes on depends primarily the
excellence of the product Issued by his
house and hence the Increase of Its
business
The buyer's work is not arduous, and
to all appearance his task 1b a simple
one He walks along the flat board
laid along the top of the fence, glanc
ing keenly at the cattle in the different
pens Some he passes by without a
pause, others he stops to Inspect more
closely, and occasionally he displays
his Interest in a group by asking a
question or two of the man in charge
Long experience enables him at a
glance to distinguish between a grass
fed steer and a corn fed steer, to de
cide whether an animal is entitled to
be classed as "fancy," "good" or "com
mon" and to guess within a few pounds
of an animal's exact weight by glanc
ing at him The buyer makes his pur
chases "on the hoof," paying the mar
ket price ruling for the day for the
grade in which it Is decided each group
of cattle' belongs In a few words the
transaction Is completed, and the buy
er's Interest in the affair Is ended—

An Anecdote of Bach
The uke of SoxeTVelmar once init
ed John Sebastian Bach, the Nestor of
German music, to attend a dinner at
the palace Before the guests sat down
to the feast Bach was asked to gie
an Improisation The composer seat
ed himself at the harpsichord and
straightway forgot all about dinner
and eerything else He played so long
that at last the duke touched his shoul
der and said, "We are ery much
obliged, master, but we must not let
the soup get cold"
Bach sprang to his feet and followed
the duke to the dining room without
ottering a word But he was scarcely
seated when be sprang up, rushed back
to the instrument like one demented,
struck a few Chords and returned to
the dining room, eidently feeling much
better  "I beg pardon, your highness,"
he said, "but you interrupted me in a
series of chords and arpeggios on the
dominant seenth, and I could not feel
at ease until they were resoled Into
the tonic It is as if you had snatched
a glass of water from the lips of a man

Falcon* In Japan
In the olden times in Japan all the
daimlos (similar to the old English
lord) had great sport with falcons, aa
they went out to the field to catch other
birds with falcons The falcons were
tamed well and used to catch large
birds, mostly cranes" When people now
go out hunting with falcons, the men
In charge hold them upon their fin
gers As soon as one sees any bird
he lets the falcon rush at the bird; as
soon as the falcon reaches the bird he
bites at the throat and throws the bird
down to the ground Meanwhile the
holder runs to the place where they are
and catches both of them
Falcons are not large birds; but, as
they belong to the eagle family, they
are strong and brae and neer afraid
to go at any bird to kill it, but the men
In charge of falcons of course take
great care In feeding and taming them

Gall, Not Heart, In China
The Chinese, says the Shanghai Mer
cury, lay stress on the amount of gall
a man has and not on the amount of
heart Thus we read of Hou King;
who was goernor of Honan in the
sixth century, that he once captured a
rebel named Li Cheh, brought him into
the market, chopped off his hands and
his feet, ripped up his heart and cut
out his itals The ictim, howeer,
continued to Jest with his features un
distorted and his countenance un
changed His gall bladder was then
seen , to hae the capacity of a pint
measure, which completely accounted
for his stocisin In 1045, when the ar
mies of the Mantchoos were gradually
oerrunning China, one Wu Han Chao
made head against them in Annul, b  t
he finally fell into their hands The
historian records that his gall was
three inches long 
After the Strike
He tried the door with his key, but
the thing was locked on the inside —
locked and bolted' And just as he
was about to apply the knocker a
oice, stern and admonitory, reached
him from aboePersonal
"Hello! Who are you? What do
you want?"

THE COUNTING OUT PROCESS
In Tuolumne county at the late
election the hottest fight gathered,
as in Amador county, around the
contest for sheriff The outcome at
the polls was that 'A flams, the re
publican nominee, d uated Sweeney,
the democratic incumbent and candi
date for reelection, by a slim margin
of two otes On this slender show
ing the political schemers resoled
themseles into a committee of ways
and means to defeat the choice of
the people as expressed at the bal
lotbox At the canass of the re
turns by the democratic board of
superisors, it was found that the
election officers of one small pre
cinct, Springfield, had failed to send
in a tally list with the returns, and
objection was made in behalf of
Sweeney to the counting of the ote
of the precinct on this ground The
officers of election were summoned,
and the missing tally sheet was re
coered Still the" cry to throw out
the ote would not down The tally
list did not accompany the sealed
package containing the returns The
district attorney gae his opinion in
faor of counting the ote, but in
face of all this the democratic
majority oted to reject the returns
in toto, and thereby declared Sween
ey elected by a majority of one ote
That is a nice sample of justice, to
gain a partisan end It is the most
barefaced fraud perpetrated by an
official body that has come under
onr notice for a long time It is
safe to say that it will fail of its pur
pose Of course, Adams will contest
the matter in the courts How in
dignant the soereign oters of
Springfield must feel at the thought
that they can be disfranchised be
cause of the simple error of an elec
tion officer in neglecting^to inclose
a tally sheet with the returns If
this action is to be sustained, people
will begin to think that the right of
suffrage in free America rests on au
extremely insecure basis We en
ture to say that the democracy of
Tuolumne county will be the princi
pal sufferer by this insane moe
Citizens, as a rule, regardless of
partisanship, loe fairness and right
dealing aboe all things, and they
will not tolerate a reersal of the
choice of the oters on such a barren
technicality as the absence of a por
tion of the election returns in the
sealed package Such highhanded
proceedings will come to nought
Later reports show that this
scheme was speedily frustrated
The superior court on mandamus
proceedings ordered the superisors
to count the ote of the precinct,
thereby giing the election to the
republican candidate, and placing
Sweeney in the position of con
testant
INTEMPERATE AVICE
In our democratic cotemporary
last week there appeared an article
signed Frank O'Connell, President
Jackson Miners' Union No 115
It berates the workingmen because
they do not flock in a body to join
the infant organization, which prom
ises to introduce the millenium for
the workingmen of Amador county
It is not the proince of the Ledger
to urge men to join, or refrain from
joining in this moement The toil
ers of Amador county are as a rule
intelligent men, and ought to be
able to judge, each one for hiaiself,
as to what course he should pursue,
without adice from any one, and
especially without the assistance of
agitators from the outside We do
deem it a duty we owe to the com
munity to protest against the in
cendiary utterances of the article in
question, which hae no other object
in iew but to make the working
men dissatisfied with their lot, and
the conditions under which they
hae lied happily and contentedly
for so many years The writer
intimates that the present system of
employment is "legalized robbery"
That is a ery indefinite expression,
notwithstanding that it is emphatic
and intended to catch the ears of
the unwary Of course, the writer
does not attempt to explain what he
means by such inflammatory lan
guage The proposition is simply to
kindle the fires of dissatisfaction; to
array the wageearners against the
wagepayers This seems to be the
primary object in iewPersonal and with the
display of such a spirit we beliee
the bulk of lawabiding, peaceloing
citizens will conclude that it is best
to leae such apostles of mischief
seerely alone The only clearcut
idea that we can find in the com
munication is that miners are to
join hands with those who are "bat
tling for the abolition of the wage
system, and the emancipation of
the wage taker from the grasp of
corporate oppression" So this agi
tator aims not to raise the price of
labor, but to wipe out the wage sys
tem entirely He would pull down
the whole fabric of wage earning
That means the abolition of all dis
tinction between employers and em
ployes The end in iew, therefore,
is not reformation, but reolution
The era of the workman being worthy
of and receiing the just alue of his
hire is to be replaced by the era of
socialism and all things in common
Such is the laboring man's paradise
toward which these isionaries are
trying to steer the "magnificent
essel 1 ' they hae recently launched
No wonder the dreamers meet with
scant encouragement in a sensible
community like the people of Ama
dor county It would be just as
well to take a small tumble, and get
down to earthy and practical things
FREETRAE A POOR REMEY
The president is sincere in his cru
sade against the  trusts — there can
be no doubt of that  But the presi
dent is statesman enough to know
that the tariff neither gae birth to
these enormous aggregations nor
largely fostered them after they
came into existence The shallow
theory of those who would assail the
trusts by remoing the protectie
tariff from the goods which they
handle is that foreign goods would
then come into the country and drie
down the prices It is true enough
that foreign goods would come into
the country if the tariffs were re
moed Foreign goods are already
coming into the country in spite of
high tariffs But foreign goods are
trustmade as well as our own, and
if they once command our markets,
driing our own factories out of ex
istence, the prices will rise higher
than they eer were before This is
not guesswork, but the lesson of ex
perience While we are shouting
against the oppressions of American
trusts", let us not forget that when
the manufacturers of Great Britain
commanded the American markets
the prices were much higher than
they are now
If the antitrust crusaders wish to
punish the trusts they might be able
to do something in that line by re
moing the protectie tariffs" But
in punishing the trusts what will
happen generally to our country?
In the first place, the tariff protected
trusts do not monopolize a single in
dustry in the United States We
hear much of the steel and iron
trust, and it is the biggest one on
the American continent But the
fact remains that about onehalf of
the total output of manufactured
iron and steel is the product of small
and independent factories Of the
total production of iron ore in 1901
the steel trust produced only 43 per
cent Of the Bessemer the trust's
share was 58 per centPersonal Of the steel
rails the trust's share was 59 per
cent Of all rolled products the
trust's share was 50 per cent For
the year 1902 the production of the
independent concerns will show a
larger per cent It is proof that
the small concerns are growing and
that the trust cannot monopolize the
situation But whateer of situa
tion there could be remaining after
our markets had been opened to
foreign goods would most certainly
be commanded by the trust, for it
can lie longer in the face of such a
competition 
In punishing the trusts we would
destroy the smaller industries Fur
thermore, we would take from
American workmen an amount equal
to the labor performed in the pro
duction of all imported goods One
does not need to dele in history and
study the laws of political economy
in order to form a conception •of
what this would mean to our coun
try We need only hark back to
the gloomy days of 1893 456, when
3,000,000 willing American laborers
were_out of employment Far better
would it be for the United States to
put up with the eils which we hae
with us than to return to those
greater ones of seen years ago —

LABOR AN WEALTH
In ihese times of labor prosperity,
and, as a result, of labor, agitation
and unrest,a number of stereotyped
phrases are being handed around,
intended to intensify the fealing of
dissatisfaction with existing condi
tions We are told that the work
ingmen are the creators of all the
wealth of Amador county, and the
inference is that haing created it,
they should also be the possessors,
if not of the whole, at least of
the major share, thereof As an
abstract proposition,' the statement
is far from the truth, g Man' IsPersonal not
the creator of anything He can
imitate, make and fashion put of pre
existing materials an almost infinite
ariety of articles, but he cannot
create The wealth that has been
deeloped around us lay dormant in
nature long before, by the handicraft
of man, it was brought to its present
condition to minister to the comfort
of human kind But the main
trouble is that the word labor when
applied by these agitators in con
nection with weal th is used in the
restricted sense, as meaning mere
manual labor There is no denying
that labor is king in this world of
industry and actiity But there
are arious kinds of labor In fact,
all men are laborers It is an en
tirely mistaken idea that the men
who do the commonest kiud of work
are the only toilers that desere con
sideration Those who work with
the brain are entitled to as much, if
not more, honor in the adance
ment of wealth and progress, than
those whose energies are confined to
the exercise of muscle and strength
alone It is in the line of mental
actiity— the inention of labor
saing machinery and the harness
ing of the forces of nature to the
cause of human adancement— that
the march of progress is mainly due
All labor is equally  honorable
There is nothing dishonorable in any
kind of labor directed in legitimate
channels The worker that deles
in the mine is just as  much honor
ably employed as the man that de
signs a locomotie But when it
comes to the recompense of labor
that is another question The price
of labor, like the price of eery other
commodity, is goerned by the law
of supply and demand That kind
of labor, which is scarcest is the
highest priced; the grade of labor
that is commonest or the most
plentiful is always the lowest priced
Genius — and by that term we mean
an abnormal expertness in any de
partment of human actiity— always
commands, and as a matter of right
should command, a higher, compen
sation than mediocrity This law —
bearing as it does the royal sign
manual of nature's approal — has
always held supremacy in human af
fairs It is in accordance with that
fundamental law of selfprotection
which leads eery man to secure the
highest possible price for his capital
— labor Let agitators try as they
may by organization and the force
of numbers to break down this rule,
they can neer succeed Under
exceptional conditions the law may
be disturbed temporarily, but in the
end nature will assert its supremacy
by a return to normal conditions
WHY THEY COME
Senator Harris of Kansas isited
Europe' during the summer and, on
his return, takes the stump and de
nounces' the protectie tariff be
cause he bought in Europe a pair of
shoes made in Massachusetts for
less money than he was asked for
the same make of shoes in Boston
According to official returns 648,745
people  came from foreign lands to
make homes in • the United States
during the past year It would be
interesting to know how many more
stayed at home because the price of
American shoes is less in Europe
than is asked for the same shoes in *
the United States It is absolutely
certain that 99 per cent of the immi
grants to the United States come
because they know that it is easier
to get the price of a pair of shoes
here, than it is in Europe, een if
they had cost twice as much here as
there— Seattle ' 'PostIntelligencer

Farnsworth Indeed, in Amador coun
ty he is wellknown and highly re
spected, haing sered the county as
district attorney for one term He ran
away ahead of his ticket in this county
on account of the personal friendship
and esteem of many republicans But
Shaw suffered throughout the state,
not because of a lack of qualifications,
but simply because he occupied a
smaller space on the ticket than his
running mate Angellotti Farnsworth
on the other hand held the antage
position on the democratic, as Ange
lotti did on the republican ticket
Hence he ran for ahead in some coun
ties, while Shaw fell far behind It is
pleasing to be able to state that not
withstanding the aderse circum

the party strength was sufficient to
pull him through in spite of his tre

THE REAL MOTHER OF TRUSTS
"While the leading topics that!
President Rooseelt will discuss in
his forthcoming message to Congress
will be the tariff and the trusts, it
is said that he "will discuss them
separately, because he holds with
other republican leaders that the
tariff is not responsible for the
trusts" This is not, howeer, a
mere party iew, adopted because
of party exigency It is a truth
that is readily apparent The catch
phrase of democratic orators is that
the "tariff is the mother of the
trusts" It would be much nearer
the point to say that prosperity is
the mother of the, trusts When it
is declared that the tariff is, the
mother of trusts the demand is that
the tariff be killed When it is said;
that prosperity is tbpir source, who
wants to kill prosperity? If there
were no capital there "would beno
trusts, but who" wants, to "rid the

There was a total of 2806 otes
cast in Amador county at the recent
election, against 2833 polled at "the

showing a falling of twenty seen
X)f this number there were 2699
otes counted for goernor There
were more otes counted for tde
bead of the ticket than for any other
office on state or local tickets
And still there was a loss on this is
sue of 107 otes  This loss repre
sents ballots rejected on the score
of being improperly marked, and
perhaps a few that failed to ote for

pears that four per cent of electors
failed to register their preference
for goernor A much larger per
centage of failures is shown for

justices of the supreme court the
loss is enormous Two candidates
were to be oted for, and the total
number of otes recorded is 4280,
which represents 2140 persons ot

on this issue oted for two candi

failed to record their wishes at all
This amounts to nearly onefourth
of the oting strength of the county*
On the county ticket, the largest
number of otes cast was for the

is intended to make labor scarce in this
icinity, but is really calculated to
bring laborers here instead of keeping
them away The idea is to get them
to stay away while plans are perfected
to strike for higher wages We en
ture to say if that time eer comes un
der present conditions itwill proe the
most disastrous moe for the people, of
Jackson — business men and laborers
alike — that could possibly oertake the
town The mines here would, close
They Would close not only 'from choice,'
but from necessity ' Our, mines are
lowgrade propositions, and any at
tempt to reise the scale of wages
now existing', would be promptly re
sisted by a complete paralysis of the
mining industry Now if the business
interests of Jackson want to inite a
calamity of that kind, which means
their own undoing, they can do so by
giing aid and encouragement to the
mischief breeders and agitators who
are now seeking to disturb the rela
tions of employers and employes

eafness Cannot be Cured
by local applications as they cannot
reach the diseased portion of the ear
There is only one way to cure deafness,
and that is by constitutional remedies
eafness is caused by an inflamed con
dition of the mucous lining of the Eus
tachian Tube When this tube is in
flamed you hae a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can be
taken out and this tube restored to its
normal condition, hearing will be de
stroyed foreer; nine cases out of ten
are caused by Catarrh, which is noth
ing but an inflamed condition of the
mucous surfaces

SUIT TO RECOVER INSURANCE
Speer Bros Sue the Scottish Union and
Sational on Four Policies, on Which '
Payment of Loss Was Refused 
The suit of W E Speer and Arthur
Speer against the Scottish Union and
National Insurance Company to re
coer the sum of $181932 with interest
at seen per cent was commenced in
the superior court on Monday morning
A jury trial was waied by both par
ties, so that the court alone is to de
cide the issues inoled The case has
been pending for oer 18 month?
Plaintiffs' side of the case is looked
after by W J McGee and John F
ais, while defendant's attorney is
J W Goodman of San Francisco, an
attorney who is eidently a specialist
in insurance cases, and who is also as
sisted by C P Vicinl The plaintiffs
were owners of Granite station, near
New York Ranch,, and outbuildings
connected therewith, consisting of
dance hall, barn, blacksmith's shop,
and personal property contained thora
in On this property they took out
four separate policies of insurance, in
the Scottish Union, coering all the
property liable to damage by fire The
policies wore written by L J Fonten
rose, and signed by Mrs L J Fonten
rose as agent for the Insurance corpo
ration uring the night of the 11th
of Noember, 1900, a fire occurred, re
sulting in the total loss of the build
ings and personal property, comprising
hay, barley, liquors, \ furniture, etc
The origin of the fire was wrapped in
mystery The agents of the company
were promptly notified, and au ad
juster appeared on the scene of the fire
about a week after the occurrence in
company with L J Fontemose to esti
mate the loss The policies proided
that in no case should the company In
case of loss be liable for moro than
threefourths of the alue of the prop
erty at the time of the fire Appraisers
were appointed and an umpire to fix
the alue of the loss and the amount
the company should pay uuder the
threefourths clause They reported,
but still the company declined to put
up, and finally suit was brought to re
coer the sum aboe named, being the
amount awarded by the arbitrators
Eery legal obstacle was resorted to
by the defendants, and twice the com
plaint had to be amended before it was
found proof against demurrer It
seems that plaintiff had preiously insu
red a dwelling on the Speer ranch, two
miles distant from the station, in the
same company, and this property was
destroyed by fire a few months before
the fire occurred which swept the sta
tion property The loss on the ranch
dwelling house was promptly paid by
the company The second fire follow
ing so close upon the other, awakened
suspicion and led the company to in
estigate closely, resulting in a de
termination to contest The company
tries to aoid payment on the ground
that It was a fraudulent fire
W E Speer was the first witness, and
was on the stand Tuesday morning and
all day Wednesday It was brought
out on crossexamination that no
one slept on the premises on the night
of the fire; that no one had lied there
steadily for three weeks preceding the
fire That his brother was in the habit
of going to the station in the morning,
working in the blacksmith shop and
tho saloon, and returning to the ranch
home at night That on Noember 3
a dance was held in the hall, and both
Speer boys were there all that night,
but from that time until the fire no one
bad slept on the premises, except his
brother for one night and he was not
positie about that He claimed there
was 451 tons of hay in the barn at the
time of the fire; no horses, harness or
wagons', the hall had nothing therein;
two stoes in the dwelling and a quan
tity of barley, flour, liquor and cigars
in the saloon and store, all of which
was destroyed The witness was sub
ject to crossexamination, but stood
the ordeal without any material Im
pairment of his oidence in chief
Arthur Speer, A C Barrett, T Bar
rett, and one or two others testified,
and the plaintiffs closed their case
Thursday afternoon The defense
introduced no testimony A number
of witnesses had been supoened, but
were not called The case was not
argued orally, but will be submitted on
briefs; plaintiffs waering the opening
brief; defendant to hae 10 days to file
brief, and plaintiffs 10 days thereafter
to file answering brief
There is no doubt, whicheer way
the matter is decided, that it will be
appealed to the higher court The
defense seems to rely upon the failure
of the insured parties to send in proofs
of loss within the time allowed by the
policies, and also on the fact that the
promises were not occupied at the time
of the fire

summer, came down from those alpine
regions early last week, and has' taken
a position at Electra until the com
mencement of next season's operation?
He reports that all work about the
dams of the upper system has been
suspended for the winter Fie men
hae been left in charge to look after
the works during the winter months
Next year, and indeed for seeral years
to co mo, it is intended to do consider
able work In that locality In fact,
the improements contemplated by the
company are merely beginning The
dam at eer alley has not been fairly
commenced, only the preliminary work
haing been started this year It is
claimed that millions of dollars will be
spent in increasing tho storage capacity
of the company A shortage of water
was threatened just before the starting
of the heay rains last month, but for
tunately the crisis was tided oer by
the timely arrial of a copious rainfall
The works of the company are running
full force The recent heay rains did
no damage to the ditch or the works
Eerything appears to hae got down
to a good working basis This is a well
earned reward The company has ex
pended a mint of money in this ast
undertaking, and deseres to reap a
substantial harest for the pluck and
energy displayed in conducting the

ance The candidates are not required

accompanied with, an affidait, others
are without the force of the oath

A Serious Time
There was a serious cae in the
Oneida mine, ln Amador county last
Monday, by which two former Cala
erai men had a close call for their
lies , Hosea Allen, son of H G Allen
of this place, and Jack Stroud, Personal also
well known here,' were the ' ictims!
They were at work in an upraise,
when the ground began to gie way,
and sought refuge under a cap The
ground continued to fall, nearly crush
ing the men, and cutting off their re
treat from the outside world
A crew of rescuers was at once put to
work, but the ground was bad to
handle, and despite the hardest and
most courageous work it was fifteen
hours before they were reached When
at last they were relieed from their
perilous position, it became a question
of how to get out The ground was
falling all about them, and it was about
as dangerous to attempt to get away as
to stay 
At length young Allen made a break
and succeeded in getting away safely,
just as the ground fell again, burying
Stroud from sight It took about
another hour of strenuous work to get
him out Both men finally reached
the surface, but little the worse from
their long imprisonment — Calaeras
Prospect
The cae aboe referred to occurred
two weeks ago at the 1850 foot leel
The men were put to work to secure a
dangerouspiece of ground, that gae
timely warning of falling Before
they could get the timbers in place the
mass of loose debris fell, completely
shutting them in So thoroughly was
the opening filled that all air was shut
off The men were thus imprisoned
from 11 o'clock at night until 9 the
next morning They kept their candles
burning during this anxious time, and
this was a source of danger, as a burn
ing candle will consume as much air
itality as a liing man The ictims
of this perilous adenture escaped with
out a scratch, but with an experience
that will; be remembered by them
through life ; •

A FAITHLESS LAWYER
lccepted a Retaining Fee and Then
Played Ills Client False
A lawyer tells how he once played a
client false "I shall hae to make a
lawyer out of that boy of mine I
don't see any other way out of it," de
clared the well known attorney, with a
laugh "He came into my office on his
ray home from school and laid a nick
el down on the desk before me 'What
is this for, son?' I asked 'Retainer,' he
answered soberly 'Very well,' said t,
entering into the joke 'What hae I
been retained upon?' My boy dug down
into his pocket and produced a note
from his teacher and placed it before
me without comment It was to the
effect that he had been 'cutting up' and
adised a whipping 'Now, what would
you adise?' asked he in a businesslike
oice after I had read the note and
saw the trap that young rascal led me
Into 'I think that our first moe should
be to apply for a change of enue,'
said I 'Very well,' he answered
'You're handling the case' Then we
will turn the note oer to your mother,'
said I I saw the young imp's face fall
at this, but he braced up and said,
'See here, pop, you're bound to see me
through on this, 'cause you'e accepted
my retainer, you know!' 'I'll argue
your case before the court,' I answered,
'but'you'll hae to accept the decision
I would not dare to attempt to influ
ence the court' Well, I pleaded the
boy's case, promptly had it thrown out
of court, and the boy got what ho de
sered, a good whipping It was the
first time I eer played false to a
client"— etroit Free Press 
A Gluttonous Boy
A merchant died at Ispahan in the
earlier part of fast century who had
for many years denied himself and hip
son eery Bupport except a crust of
coarse bread On a certain occasion
he was oertenipted to buy a piece of
cheese; but, reproaching himself with
extraagance, he put the cheese into
a bottle and contented himself and
obliged the boy to do the same, with
rubbing the crust against the bottle,
enjoying the cheese in imagination
One day, returning home later than
usual, the merchant found his son eat
ing his crust, which he constantly rub
bed against the door
"What are you" about, you, fool?" was
his exclamation "It is dinner time,
father You hae the key; so, as I
could not open the door, I was rub
bing my bread against it, as I could
not get to the bottle" "Cannot you go
without cheese one day, you luxurious
little rascal? You'll neer be rich"
And the angry miser kicked the poor
boy for not haing been able to deny
himself the ideal gratification
Kind Words Mean Much
Cultiate kindness of heart, think
well of your fellow men, look with
charity upon the shortcomings inthetf
lies o a good turn for them as
opportunity offers, and, finally, don't
forget the kind word at the right
time How much a word of kindness,
encouragement or appreciation means
to others sometimes and how little it
costs us to gie it!
We do not need to wait for some
special occasion When calamity oer
takes a friend, words of sympathy and
encouragement are offered sincerely
enough, yet in certain respects, as a
matter of course Such an occasion
calls for expression on our part, and
we naturally respond But why wait
for occasion? Why not speak the kind
word when there is no special occa
sion?— Philadelphia Ledger

FILTHY MECCA
Tlie Holy City Is the irtiest Spst la
All Islam
Mecca, the holy city of the faith,
is called by many names Some call
it "the Mother of Purity," "the Cita
del of Arabs," "the Holy Mosque"
Others speak of It as "the Mother of
Compassion," "the Supreme Sanctity,"
"the Guardian Angel of AJem" The
deout neer utter the" word Mecca
without adding toit some adjectie
of praise, suctf as "the blessed," "the
"exalted," "the great," "the highly es
teemed," and so on The town Itself
is about two miles in length and one
mile In breadth
The dirtier the pilgrim keeps himself
the more respected he is as a pious
Moslem Consequently Mecca, being
as it is the most sacred city of the
faith, is literally the filthiest In Islam
The most Important streets measure
about ten yards in width The rest
are mere lanes," wonderfully and pic
turesquely crooked and some six feet
wide The streets were crowded with
tents, camels, mules, asses, horses,
pariah dogs and a motley crowd of pil
grims, unspeakably disheeled and un
washed, while the lanes were abso
lutely filled with eery kind of offal
and refuse Mecca, wlilch lies In a
hollow, would be a regular cesspool
were it not for the pariah dogs, lean,
snarling brutes of a bright yellowish
color, that sere the purpose of sca
engers, and the fierce, dry, Arabian
sun that is the sole sanitary inspector
In the country The din the dogs make
at night is Indescribable A pack of
jackals would be quiet in comparison
Hair Needs Exercise
One reason why so many men are
bald, according to a foreign medical
Journal, is' because they allow their
hair to die through want of exercise
Under the skin which coers the head
are seeral muscles, It explains, and
these; are neer stirred into actiity,
the result being that they do not per
form their proper function, and conse
quently the skin Js insufficiently nour
ished and the hair gradually dies
"Women," It continues, "do not be
come bald, and the reason is because
they spend much more time combing
and arranging their hair than men do
uring this operation the skin on the
head is stirred into actiity, and as a
result the muscles remain actie and
the hair flourishes
"It is eident, therefore, that the best
way to preent baldness is to rub the
skin frequently and igorously, for un
less this is done the muscles' will be
unable to supply it with the proper
amount of nourishment"

THE BALKY HORSE %
'A Little Trick That, It Is Said, WIU
Start Him Eery Time
For the benefit of those who hae
been caused a great deal of anxiety by
a balky horse, lost trains as well as
tempers and sometimes een ruined
th> liorse, the next time they hae the
errrorieuce to ruu across a balky horse,
no matter how bad he Is, let me tell
you how to start him ninetynine times
out of a hundred 7~'l
Of course it may fall one time in a
hundred When a horse balks, no mat
ter how badly be sulks or how ugly he
Is do not beat him on't throw sand
in his ears, don't use a rope on bis
fore legs or een burn straw under
him Quietly go and pat him on the
head a moment Take a hammer or
een pick up a stone in the street
tell the drier to sit still, take his lines,
hold them quietly while you lift up
either frou^foot' gie each nail a light
tap and a good smart tap on the frog,
drop the foot quickly and then chirp
to him to go In ninetynine cases out
of a hundred the horse will go right on
about his business, but the drier
must keep his lines taut and not pull
or jerk him back
 If I hae tried this once, I hae tried
it 500 times, and eery time I hae
suggested it people hae laughed and
een bet 55 and bottles of wine that I
could not do it So far I hae won e
ery bet This may make yoH smile, but
a horse has more common sense than
most people are willing to gie him
credit for The secret of this little trick
is simply diersion I am a firm belie
er that with kindness and proper treat
ment a horse can be drien with a
string— Horse Shoers' Journal

ried in a stall, and on occasion was
split after the manner of a steel or

Where Women Propose
In the Ukraine, Russia, the woman
does all the courting When she falls
in loe with a man, she goes to his
bouse and Informs htm of the state of
her feelings If he reciprocates, all is
well, and the formal marriage is duly
arranged If, howeer, he is unwill
ing, she remains there, hoping to coax
him to a better mind The poor fellow
cannot treat her with the least dis
courtesy, nor has he the consolation of
being; able to turn her out, as her
friends in such a case would feel bound
to aenge the insult His remedy,
therefore, if determined uot to marry
her Is to leae his home aud stiy away
as long as she is in it A similar prac
tice to that in the Ukraine exists among
the Zuni tribe of Indian^ The woman
does all the courting and also controls
the situation after marriage  To her
belong all the children, and' descent,
including inheritance, is also on her
side, i • ;
Unique Venice
Venice is unique and always as long
as she exists will be unique The city
is built on 117 islands connected by be
tween 350 and 400 bridges There are
streets, all ery narrow except in the
neighborhood of St Mark's, but the
gondola is the uniersal means of
transportation When you leae the
station, you find the Bait waes of the
Grand canal lapping against the mar
ble steps and gondolas drawn up
agalust them like cabs and buses If
you wish to keep all the illusions you
hae cherished about Venice, enter it at
sunset, at the full of the moon— on San
Marco's night if the calendar permits—
and depart before daybreak Then yon
,will retain in your mind a picture of
the Venice of song, story and tradition
—the ideal Venice
She Cornered Him
The city editor, was troubled, not to
say angry ; '•*
"Hang It all," he exclaimed, as he
read the letter addressed to his depart,
ment, "my wife has been asking me
that question for the last week, and I
refused to be bothered"— He looked at
the letter again and jumped out of his
chair "Thunder and guns," he cried,
"it's her handwriting too! Now that
she has learned the trick she'll' make
me settle eery social, household and
historical question that comes up, and
I'll be right on hand to take the blame
if I make a mistake"
For a long time he remained buried
in thought Then he resigned—Brook

PATH OF OCEAN CABLES
,tibraarlne Tablelands That Stretch
Across the Atlantic
There seems to be no logical reason
why cables cannot be laid across any
section of the oceans of the world, no
matter how great the depth Some por
tions of the Atlantic cables are three
miles below thesurface, and this is not
necessarily the extreme depth, for the
cable may and probably does, pass
from the top of one submarine hill to
another without drooping
into the deep alleys between',^ says
Llpplncott's Magazine The greatest
known depth of the sea is 40,036 feet,
or 7 35 miles, found in the south At
lantic midway between the island of
Tristan da Cunha and the mouth of
the Rio de la Plata Soundings hae
been made to the depth of 27,480 feet
in the north Atlantic south of New
foundland, and about 3t,OOQ feet, or
nearly V 4 miles, is reported south of
the Bermudas • Een such enormous
depths as these need not hinder cable
laying so' far as the theory is con
cerned, but in practice, for reasons of
economy in maintenance and other
wise, It Is found best to take adan
tage of faoring conditions in the
ocean's bed To illustrate, all of the
cables between the United States and
Europe run up along our coast until
they reach the neighborhood of New
foundland before starting across to
their destination in Ireland or France
The reason for this is found in the
range of submarine tablelands, form
Ing an ideal cable bed, which lies be
tween the three latter countries  
The Sea Tront
The gamest of salt water fish, after
the striped bass, is the weakfish, or sea
tront The sport of angling for them
is generally enhanced because, feeding
as they genera '!y do near the surface,
it Is possible to fish for them with light
tackle The best places to find them
In the icinity at New York are 'Ja
maica bay, the southwestern shore of
Stnten Island and the mouth of the
Shrewsbury rier  While they hae
been caught weighing upward of twen
ty pounds, a six or ten pounder is a
good size, and the aerage will only
run from one to two and a half There
Is neer any doubt when a weakfish
bites He does not nibble around the
hook, but takes the bait at one fan
swoop and then starts off with it like
a limited express with time to make
up He is a shy fish, and the man
who uses a small line, light leaders
and snells to his hook and keeps quiet
while fishing is the one who is apt to
hae the best luck — Country Life In
America'
