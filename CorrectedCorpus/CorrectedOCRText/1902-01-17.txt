FOLLIES OF FASHION
SARTORIAL VAGARIES OF THE CEN
TURIES THAT ARE GONE
Grotesque Styles Tbat Relffaed In
the Time of Chaucer — Raiment
That Rialed the Rntnbaw and
Men Who Stnrched Their Bearda
It Is a little gratifying to reflect that,
howeer the man of today may com
pare with his ancestors of bygone cen
turies In 'physique and morals, bis
dress Is much more moderate and in
expensie, een If it Is less pictur
esque, than theirs
It Is true that here and there one
may find some foolish young man
whose tas^e in dress is as extraagant
as that pf any "buck" of the days of
the Georges There is, for instance, a
son of a well known peer who has the
reputation of neer wearing a suit
twice ' He has a wardrobe of waist
coats of all the colors of the rainbow,
rapging from a light blue spangled
with siler stars to a deep green satin
with buttons of eighteen carat gold,
each of which Is adorned with the
painted face of a beautiful woman
wealthy aristocrat is credit
ed with haing as many B|ilts and uni
forms as there arii ila'ys"}!) tbeyeaf
and with spending on his tailor's bill
a sum which would pay the yearly
salary of a minor cabinet minister
But such men are modestly arrayed
compared with the dandles of many a
past century The earl of Northum
berland who lied in the latter part of
flip fourteenth pentury boasted no few
er than' sixty suits of plpth gf gold
alppe, and ' tlje bishop of Ely pf thap
time had a chapge of raiufent for e
ery day of the year
Much later In Queen Mary's time,
the wardrobe of a bishop might hae
been the eny of Solomon for the a
riety and costliness of its contents, and
een a simple illage priest, according
to Pufler, wore "a estment of crimson
satin, a estment ot crimson elet, a
stole and fanonset with pearl," ijtpwns
facptjwfth taffetas, efc" •
In the days of Chaucer fashionable
men wore clothes as many colored as
Joseph's coat, so that "while one leg
would be a blaze of crimson the other
would be tricked out in green or blue
or yellow, without any regard to har
mohy or contrast"
Een as late as the middle of the
eighteenth et-ntury a dandy would deck
hlnitiflf in "a iid green coat, a waist
coat of' scarlet, »Uow breeches an<J
blue stockings," and the gfutlemau of
a few years later wore, among simi
lar sartorial agaries, "a coat of light
green, with sleees too small for the
arms and buttons too big for the
sIePVSS; 3 pair of Manchester fine stuff
breeches, without money (n their popk
ets; clouded silk stockings, a club of
hair behind larger than the head that
carries it a hat of the size of a six
pence on a block not worth a far
thing" ;  V
Personal 4t one fasbjonable epoch our ances
tors, to quote the words of a quaint
chronicler, "would weare clothes so
tighte to ye skin that It might well be
ppneeied they wore no clothes at all,"
and ot a&ojther they would wear them
"so' yolumiuoiis iliat a suite
might well hae afforded r^ymentior
a whole famllie, and so stuffed out
with feathers that, of a erity, their
wearers resembled nothing so much as
walking sackes"
At ' another period I£ was the gro
tesque fashion to combine on one per
son the dress of all the countries of
Europe— the hat would be Spanish, the
coat French, the trousers Turkish, and
so on— so that the wearer was a "walk
ing epitome of the dress of a conti
nent" '"' PersonalPersonal,i
At one time shoes would be worn
with square toes of such width that a
royal proclamation was Issued limiting
the width to six Inches, and these
shoes were succeeded by others which
came to the finest of points at the toes
In Henry ll's time shops with points
two feet long were worn by the fash
ionables, and in the reign of Henry
IV these points had grown to such an
inordinate length that In order to be
able to walk at aJJ If was necessary to
attach the tips to the knees by chains,
which were of gold or siler, while the
tops of the shoes were cared with all
kinds of fantastic designs
Jn £he early par* pf the eighteenth
century it was a common thing for a
man of fashion to spend seeral hours
a day with his alet among the many
quaint operations being "the starching
pf the beard and the proper perfuming
of garments, the painting of the face
and anointing with oils, tinctures, quin
tessences and pomatums'" It Is een
said that some of the dandies of the
time bathed In wine and milk "for the
preseration of their complexions and
the rejuenation of their energies"—

COSTLY PLATE
Borne London Companies nae Old
and Interesting Serices
Few people,- at least In this country,
possess plate worth such a fabulous
sum as that owned by London's lord
mayor during his term of office Its
face- alue has been computed to be
slightly oer £20,000, though three
times that amount would not buy it
owing to the historical interest attach
ed to many of the articles
The two solid siler soup tureen <
which are employed at the banquet to
distribute 100 gallons of clear turtle to
the guests are alued at £300 apiece
and are said to hae been in possession
of the corporation for oer a century
Moreoer, there nre a gross of siler
dinner plates worth £1,500, 200 ice
pails alued at nearly £1,000 200 en
tree dishes, the cost of which £2000
would not coyer; 80 split) siler meat
dishes worth another £2,000, and hun
dreds of other articles, such as grape
scissors, salt cellars, wine cups, wait
ers' trays, decanter labels, etc, all of
solid gold or siler and alued at oer
£5,000 !
Thig collection of plate is constantly
being Increased, for' eery lord, mayor
at the expiration of his term of office
is expected to add an Item, the cost of
whiph must not be lower than 100
guineas,,'" "
In addition the lord mayor's official
regalia Is costly In the extreme The
diamond pendent that bangs about his
neck could not be bought for £1,000,
and his collar cost a quarter of that
sum, while his pearl sword necessitat
ed the corporation spending £900 when
It was new
Buf fhe Other companies in the city
possess plate of een greater alup
The Goldsmiths, for instance, own the
mpst priceless collection, the worth of
which It Is impossible to estimate It

POINTERS ON MANICURING
When the nails are fragile, a little
wax and alum rubbed upon them will
'strengthen them If brittle, a little

When about to uiunictirp the bauds,
dip the fingers Into warm, soapy wa

or two in order to soften the nails and
the scarfskin about them
The scarfskiu should be gently push

"When I go to the theater," says a
churchman quoted i the Philadelphia
Record, "I sit in a finely upholstered
seat Underneath Is a rack for my bat
and on the back of the seat ahead is a

church which I attend eery Sunday
Is an uncomfortable, straight backed
pew, Jntp which the ushers always in
sist upon crowding isitors after my
wife and I are seated until sometimes
six persons are seated, in a space
scarcely large enough for four to sit
comfortably Hats and wraps must
look out for themseles
•(Qf course, when I go to the theater
I pay for my seat; but In spite of the

Visiting Cards In Sweden
An old Swedish custom is for people
to indicate their business upon their
isiting cards One will receie the
card of Lawyer Jones or Banker Smith
or Notary Johnsoq or Music Professor
Brown or Grosserer (which means
wholesale merchant) "Ferguson or Geol
ogist Thompson, and if a man eer
held an office it is customary to indi
cate that fact upon his card A burgo
master is always a burgomaster, a con
sul is always a consul and an alder
man' aiways an alderman The pre
fixes "Hon" and "Mr" are seldom
used, and the title, whether commer
cial or professional, is obsered I con
ersation in the same way
It is customary also for ladies to
print their maiden names upon their
isiting cards In smaller type under
their married names, particularly if
they hae a pride of family and want
people to know their ancestry
Aniesttietloa In China
A Chinese manuscript In the Paris li

1,700 years ago It states that when a
surgeon conducted a serious operation
be gae a decoction to the patient, who
after a few moments became as insen
sible as If he were dead Then, as thf
case required, the surgeon performed
the operation — Incision or amputation—
and remoed the pause of the malady
Then he brought together and secured
the tissues and applied liniments "Aft

tient recoered without bains expe

Hnge Spiders Woe Them
Eery one who owns a little strip of
garden knows what It is to clear away
spider webs, a matter of small diffi
culty and lightly performed, but  pop
ular naturalist who lately returned
from the great woods of Central Amer
ica came across spiders' webs of such
strength and huge dimensions that
they were positie obstacles in his
path Needless to say, the tenants of
these webs were of a monstrous size
"I measured one of these fabrics,"
be says "It had a diameter of more
than sis feet without including the
long brace threads that run out like
forestays to the extremity of the sur

Conscience Money
''Conscience money" In Great Britain
now amounts to thousands of pounds
annually The first sum noticed was
on March 30, 17S0, when £3GO was car
ried to the public account In conse
quence of a note receied by the chan
cellor- The writer with troubled soul
Implored him, "as an honest man, to
consider the money the property of the
nation and to be so just as to apply
it to the use of the state In such a
manner that the nation may not suffer
by its haing been detained and thus
to ease the conscience of an honest

Cartons Freak of Insane Persons
A Belgian physician, speaking of
simulation by the Insane, says that in
eases of Insanity where the intellectual
faculties are not too much disordered
the insane may simulate another form
of insanity than their own The forms
of' insanity most often simulated are,
in order of frequency, imbecility, de
mentia and mania The other forms
are not so frequently simulated A
lunatic generally simulates insanity to
escape punishment and an expert phy
sician "should not therefore in such
cases be satisfied with a diagnosis of
simulation Such diagnosis daes not
exclude real insanity, and the physi
cian should therefore endeaor to as
certain whether or not the simulator is
himself a lunatic With care, patience
and a long continued obseration it is
possible to make a complete and cor
rect diagnosis, and this Is the more lm
portant as in these cases the serious
question of responsibility arises—Lon

Why Tomsk Waa Igmored
A correspondent of an English paper
tells why the great Transslberlan rail
way does not run through Tomsk, the
capital "How much will you gie us
If we bring the line past Tomsk?" ask
ed sureyors and engineers who
mapped the route, "Nothing!" replied
Tomsk "We are the capital of Siberia,
and you can't aoid coming here" "Oh,
can't we?" replied the route finders
"If you don't produce so many thou
sand rubles, there will be Insurmount
able engineering dlfliculties that win
preent us coming within a long way
of Tomsk" These engineering difficul
ties were discoered, and so the Trans-
Blberian railway sweeps along fifty
miles to the south of Tomsk, and a
branch line had to be made • ><

A SAVORY RECORD
The Webb gae good adice in last
week's issue of his Ledger, when he
adised people to trade at home
How well he has followed his own
adice is known to all citizens
Whereer he has been able to sae a
cent by purchasing elsewhere, he
has let home tradesmen seerely
alone "Don't do as I do, but as I
tell you to do," should hae been in
corporated in the Webb article^-
Dispatch
It is not the policy of the Ledger
to resort to offensie personalties,
after the pattern of the aboe We
hae lied long enough to know that
it is useless to try to answer an un
scrupulous liar His field of enter
prise is boundless, and his conscience
interposes no barrier to the gratifi
cation of his malicious spirit We
reproduce the aboe sample of his
raings to show our supreme con
tempt for the opinion of critters of
his ilk It is a mirror in which the
community may see reflected the true
image of his own little self Tf it
pleases him to publish such stuff for
the gratification of his readers, it
affords us equal pleasure to tickle
his depraed nature still further by
extending the article to the still
larger circle of the Ledger readers
But who is this that presumes to sit
in judgment upon the priate affairs
of his betters? Is he not a refugee
from the alleys, drien by short
ness of fodder and stress of circum
stances to seek shelter with his
brethren in the mountains? He
sought to be a leader among the
faithful of his political tribe, and
managed to get himself elected as
the chief sachem thereof, and was
thereafter dropped like a hot stoe
He was ain enough" to imagine that
he was the idol of the dear people,
and as a feeler inited himself to a
seat at the school board, and was
literally buried by unfriendly otes
He is supposed to be running a dem
ocratic sheet, but the only good
sense he has eer displayed was in
selecting his ideal candidate • from
the republican ranks Were it not
for his periodical pilgrimages to the
county's strong box in shape of po
litical patronage, he would hae
famished for lack of grass He feels
the need of an auxiliary safe, and
adised his townsfolks to set up a
city goernment This would pro
ide another aluable source of pap
from his standpoint, but the oters
detected the bug and jumped on the
scheme with both feet His faorite
pastime since his adent in Amador
has been to borrow money from who
eer would loan— He tried his
scheme on the writer, but it failed to
work, and this failure to respond to
his monetary disability is no doubt
the secret of his wrath This may
be the true key to his career as a
journalist, to proceed to abuse those
who refuse to pungle up at his bid -
ding To impart interest to his
mediocre sheet he inited corre
spondence on local topics, and pour
ed out the ials of personal abuse on
the first one that foolishly aailed
himself of the offor, under the im
pression that it ,as made in good
faith That is the way he prosti
tutes a noble calliug He has been
talking against the town of Jackson
eer since he set foot within its
limits, always predicting eils lurk
ing in the future — eils that hae
neer materialized and are neer like
ly to materialize — and the eilmon
ger continues — without any strings
attached to him — to make the imagi
nary plague spot his abiding city
He does business largely without
cash, and his creditors hae to
"make een" by trading the amount
in adertising; and he thereupon
boasts of this discreditable fact, and
falsely attributes it to the superior
quality of his journalistic wares
He chronicles that "John Doe from
Slabtown, and Richard Roe from
Jackson Gate, isited Jackson on
business," and insults the intelli
gence of Amador county by intimat
ing through a standing notice in his
columns that this sort of driel is
the mainstay of a county paper He
can find something to^cbmmend in
eery town in Amador county, ex
cept the one wherein he has cast his
lot Like most financial failures,
he prates about how other people
ought to inest their means in the
upbuilding of the town, but has neer
raised one stone upon another in
that direction himself He hugs tbe
delusion that a city composed ex
clusiely of persons like himself
would be a eritable Eden, while
sensible citizens think it would be
the place of all places on earth to
keep away from He goeth to church
and thanketh tbe Lord that he is not
like other men; and the people with
one accord doth gratefully say
"Amen"
We apologise to our readers for
wasting so much space on so small
a subject We do not approe of
this style of writing We neer re
sort to it freely ami oluntarily The
only excuse we can gie for it now
is, that it is sometimes necessary to
answer a fool along the lines of his
own folly
FEES OF COUNTY OFFICERS
Fees were collected b"y the re
spectie county* officers during the
month of December, and paid into
the county treasury as followsPersonal
U S Gregory, sheriff $ 900
D A Patterson, recorder  192 65
C L Culbert, county clerk 82 60
The insignificant showing made by
the sheriff's office calls for explana
tion The amount receied last
month from this source is aboe the
aerage One month the receipts
fell as low as $4; another $6 The
truth is the fees of the sheriff's of
fice hae irtually ceased to be a
source of county reenue Years
ago, it was an important source of
reenue The change has been
brought about not so much by fall
ing off in the business of the office,
as by tinkering with the laws go
erning the disposition of the fees
The truth is the fees hae been di
erted from the county treasury into
the pockets of the sheriff and priate
parties appointed by the court un
der recent chauges in the law as
commissioners for the sale of prop
erty under foi-eclosure All these
changes, while benefitting priate
indiiduals, and placing more pat
ronage in the hands of officials, hae
been detrimental to the interests of
the taxpayers There neer was
ajiy demaud in public sentiment for
the euactmeut of such laes The
machinery of goernment neer ran
more smoothly or with greater sat
isfaction to the people generally
than when all fees and commissions
collected by county officers were
required to be paid into the
county treasury As the law now
stands the sheriff is authorized to re
tain "for his own use and benefit,
the mileage, fees and commissions
for all serice of papers whatsoeer
issued by any court of the state out
side of his county" That is the
little joker that is responsible- for
the curtailment of reenue from
sheriff's fees The system is a per
nicious one, not merely because it
helps to swell the income of a county
officer who was before amply paid
for his serices, but for other rea
sons It remains for those respon
sible for such unwholesome changes
in the law to explain the true in
wardness thereof" We frankly ad
mit that we arc at a loss to explain
it in any way consistent with the
interests of the county
ANOTHER MOVE TO WATCH
There is a moe on foot by the
Bar Association of San Francisco to
make the costs of a jury in ciil
cases a county charge The only
plea urged in behalf of this moe
ment is that as the law now stands —
requiring the litigant in whose faor
judgment is rendered to deposit the
jury fees— a hardship is inflicted
upon poor litigants They, in many
instances, are debarred from de
manding a jury by this proision
The proposed change, howeer, is
simply another of those insidious
moes to encourage litigation at the
expense of the public We beliee
it to be the duty of the press, with
out regard to party, to fight against
any further change in this direction 
Indeed, there is ample room for re
form in the opposite direction The
county treasury is now bearing, and
has borne for many years, the main
burden of expense in deciding the
legal rights of priate contestants in
court Superior court fees hae
been whittled to almost nothing A
day's trial in court costs litigan ts
$250; while for the salary of the
superior judge alone, the taxpayers
are called upon to pay $10, to say
nothing of the salary of clerk and
sheriff The legislator who has the
courage to make a determined effort
to correct this outrage will earn the
lasting gratitude of the people
When priate parties get into a
wrangle about their rights, and ap
peal to the courts to settle their
quarrel, the losing party should be
made to\ bear the entire burden
thereof The one who is adjudged
to be in the wrong should be made
to pay It is a gross miscarriage of
justice to throw the costs upon in
nocent parties The argument tbat
poor litigants in the matter of pay
ment of jury fees are at a disad
antage, is a specious one They
would be at a disadantage under
any arrangement Because some
persons without means become in
oled in law suits, that is no reason
for imposing additional financial
burdens upon other poor men — the
bulk of the taxpayers — who hae no
interest in the outcome of the legal
strie

THE AMAI>OR LEDGERPersonal JACKSON, qALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, JANUARY IT 1902
Opinion seems to be diided as to
the most practicable aud desirable
route for the isthmian canal The
fact that the French engineers,
after a thorough examination of the
ground, decided in faor of the Pan
ama route, would indicate that that
is the more feasible plan Much
work has been done on this Hue, and
the French interests may be bought
for forty millions — a large sum it is
true, but not worth haggling oer if
important adantages are to be
gained thereby On the other hand
many faor the Nicaragua route,
for the reason probably that it would
inole less money No doubt Con
gress will digest the arguments pro
and con before finally committing
the nation to this stupendous but all
important enterprise The canal
will undoubtedly be built, and that
to by the United States, but let us
see to it that we secure the best
route obtainable A few million dol
lars one way or the other should cut
no figure in deciding the line of this
undertaking

make arrangements for the annual ball
for the benefit of the company The
attendance was larger than usual at
such gatherings It was decided to

this might interfere somewhat with the
success of the ball The following
named gentlemen were appointed an
executie committee, with full power
to arrange for the ballPersonal Dr, A M,

six year old son, confided to her
custody, spend two days of each month
with the father at the Oneto ranch,
fie miles from Jackson Mrs Oneto
obtained a diorce from Bartolomeo
Oneto some time ago The decree aU
lowed $30 per month for the support of
the minor child, and that the father
should enjoy the child's company two
days each month Mrs Oneto lies in
Jackson, and tho father resides near
Irishtown- The child has manifested
an unwillingness to leae his mother,
and hence the father's action in court
to enforce the proisions of the decree
The court ordered that the child be
taken to the Oneto ranch next Satur
day, and be returned to its mother on
Monday; this course to be followed
once eery month Also that the $30
per month for main talnauco be left at

Kirkwood — A meeting of the Kirk
wood Company was held in Jackson
the first of the week The indebtedness
of nearly $600 was wiped out by olun
tary contributions on the part of those
present It wits decided to crosscut
for the ledge at once, from the present
depth of the shaft — about 715 feet
They will run east first, as the pre
ponderating opinion Is that the ledge
lies in that direction It is also the in
tention to go west, as the surface indi
cations point to another lodge In that
direction Eerything was harmoni
ous at the meeting, and there was no
feeling of discouragement manifested
A gopd deal (jf further prospecting will
be done before they entertain tho least
idea of abandoning operations Those

Df,l MONTE— The directors of the
Del Monte group of mines in Calaeras
county, at their meeting held January
3, adopted resolutions authorizing the
superintendent to buy and install at
once a compressor and outfit for the
operating of power drills upon their
new omssoul tunnel Tlw superin
tendent immediately thereafter closed
with Jas E Dye of Jackson, for the
purchase of his Rlx and Firth single
cylinder compressor, situated on the
Amador Gold mine near Jackson In
addition to this, he purchased tho re
ceier, qut-pflhind ajyes used in con
nection therewith, 3000 feet of 3-inch
compressed air pipe, and a quantity of
drill steel with sharpening tools The
work of remoing these, to the mine
has already begun, under the super
ision of the superintendent and his
expert assistant, Cornelius O'Neill Jr
The force of men at the mine has been
increased, and all are now actiely en
gaged in preparing for the installation
of the new plant Grading for road
ways and for foundation worfc has al
roady begun, and plans and estimates
hae been prepared under the direc
tion of Messrs Garbarini of Jackson
The compressor will first be remoed
to Sutter Creek for necessary foundry
work, after which it ilj be in all re
spepts equal to a new machine -The
estimated cost of the installation of this
outfit is $2500, gross; a figure below
the not cost of a new outfit The en
tire financial outlook of the company
is brighter than at any time since the
Incorporation Only a few thousand
shares now remain unsold, and most of
these hae already been spoken for, so
that we can positiely assort that no
more stock will be upon the market
after March first They hae money
in the treasury and forthcoming from
monthly payments to prosecute the
work with full force, and intend to
make Del Monte mino one of tho busi
est little communities in the mining belt
Work is still being carried on in the
east drift, in which Indications still
show large alues ahead; as also upon
the old shaft oer tho west drift, in
which the ledge has been uncoered
two feet in width at a depth of 40
feet, -with gopd prospect showing
Rail Rpad Flat mining district has de
eloped quite a boom within the last
few months, seeral mines haing been
started with good financial backing, so
essential to successPersonal and work in most
of them is being^ prosecuted upon ex
cellent prospects The Jones mine and
the Little Giant, both near neighbors
to Del Monte, hae been working upon
aluable ore deposits, and others are
meeting equally encouraging bodies of
rock
Amador-Phoenix— A clean-up
was made at this mill last week
Mixed rock from the dump was run
through, and it was not expected that
it would proe of paying aule We
hae not learned how much it yielded
per ton The mill is now idle, but will
be started again shortly, on ore from
the leel now being opened as soon as
fuel can be procured
Argonaut— The shaft of this mine
has reached a depth of 2020 feet, and
sinking still continues in tho hardest
kind of greenstone
Burned With Gas
Albert Lagomarsino, the young man
who runs the car at the Kennedy mine,
met with a painful experience last Fri
day He was attending to the heating
of some coal tar for tarring the cables
It was at night time, and he went to
add more fuel, taking an open lantern
to throw light upon the work Tar
when heated generates an inflammable
gas As soon as the light met this gas
an explosion occurred, the jet of (lame
catching him full in the face His in
juries compelled him to quit work, and
on reaching his home on Stump street,
Jackson, Dr L E Phillips was called,
and dressed his injuries The burns
are not deep, but they were serious
enough to cause the skin to peal off
He is getting along nicely, and no per
manent marks will result from the
mishap He is still unable to resume
his employment, but expects to do so
in a few days

Good Work
A good piece of road work has been
done from the north Main street bridge
to the gulch below the old toll house
on the Kennedy grade The stretch is
about a quarter of a mile in length
The whole of it has been treated with
a thick coat of broken rock from the
Argonaut dump The job was finish
ed last Tuesday It has been done at
far less cost than any equal stretch of
roadway macadamized by the county's
rock breaker Thos Maher started
the ball, by hauling rock from the Ar
gonaut to tho road in front of his
premises Frank Hoffman, Tom Nor
man, John Strohm and Dae Mattley
then got in with their teams, and re
inforced with a team employed by the
road commissioner, they hae made
this piece of road — which for years has
been one of the worst places between
Jackson and Sutter Creek — to compare,
faorably with any portion of highway
in the county They hae been about
three weeks in doing the work It
now remains for the owners along Main
street to take up the work where these
road-makers hae left off, and extend
the improement to the middle fork
bridge Jackson will then hae a busi
ness street to be proud of, instead of an
eye-sore, as at present

Re Wouldn't Interfere
An old Scotchman wont to stay for
a short time, as he said, with friends
of his, a young couple with no family
After liing with them for some, two
or three weeks the young couple began
to get tired of their isitor, but did
not like to tell him the state of tlielr
feelings toward lilin, so they arranged
a little plnn between them as to how
they would get rid of him -
"Tomorrow," said the husband,
"when I come home for dinner, I shall
quarrel about the soup and say it is
not good In the midst of our quarrel
we will appeal to our friend, and if he
takes your part I will gie him notice
to leae the house, and if he takes my
part you do just the same"
Next day at dinner the "quarrel"
arose about the soup, and in the heat
of the argument "uncle" was appealed
to; but he coolly repliedPersonal
"Ye see, ma freens, for a' the time 1
intend tae be here— Just a month or
twa— l hae made up ma mind no tae
Interfere wi' ye'r boose affairs"
A' Story of Wendell Phillips
At the close of the ciil war and be
fore he was well known Wendell Phil
lips, the distinguished abolitionist,
went to Charleston and put up at a ho
tel Ho had breakfast sered ln bis
room and was waited upon by a slae
Mr Phillips seized tho opportunity to
represent to the nesro in a pathetic
way that he regarded him as a man
and a brother and, more than that,
that he himself was an abolitionist
The negro, howeer, seemed more anx
ious about his breakfast than he was
about his position In the social scale
or the condition of his soul, and finally
Mr Phillips became discouraged and
told him to go away, saying that ho
could not bear to be waited on by a
slae
"You must 'scuse me, massa," said
the negro "I is 'bilged to stay here
'cause I'm 'sponsible for de siler
ware"
Charity* Choice
"Mummy," said a small girl—"mum
my, dear, I do wish I might gie some
money for poor children's dinners"
"So you may, darling"
"But, mummy, I haen't any mon
ey"
"Well, darling, If you like to go with
out sugar I will gie you the money
instead, and then you will hae some"
The small child considered solemnly
for a moment, and then said "Must
It be sugar, mummy?"
"Why, no, darling I don't mind
much What would you like to do
without?"
"How would soap do, mummy,
then?" exclaimed the small maiden in
triumph— Philadelphia Ledger

When King Edward VII was an un

huntsman, and few men could beat him

An old German was on his deathbed
In his earlier years he had led a wild
life, but since the death of Schneider,
one of his boon companions, he had re
formed and gien up his bad habits
This Schneider In his day had been a
mighty drinker, famous for his capacl-
Ity and carouses
The priest was ministering to the dy
ing man, consoling him with isions
of the paradise he would soon enter,
telling him that he would meet there
his old friends ana what a joy it would
bo to see Ui ;;i ''i again
The dying man asked feebly, "Will
Schneider be there, your reerence?"
Thinking to gie him pleasure, the
priest replied, "Yes; Schneider will be
there"
"Ach!" said the other "Dot Is ery
bad All dose dringlngs und eadlngs

"But there will be no drinking In

"But you said Schneider would be

Long Courtahlp* In Norway
Norwegian weddings are almost al
ways celebrated at the close of a short
Scandinaian summer, a season which
the industrious Norsemen find too short
In which to work and from which they
would neer dream of taking the days
that are necessary for the long drawn
out festiities of the Norse wedding
So the maidens who are wooed all the
year round are usually wedded at the
beginning of winter Norwegian woo
ings are ery frank and ery long a-do-
Ing On summer Sundays the lanes,
tlie highways and byways are ateem
with loers Each couple saunters
slowly along, not In the least shy, his
arm about her shoulders, her arm about
bis waist Nor do they untwine their
arms If they pause a little to chat with
friends, not een if they stop to speak
with casual acquaintances Ten or a

first day of courtship and the day of
piarriage, while a seen years' betroth

Fable of the Babbling Brook
Once upon a time a fish In search of
adenture came to the broad moutb of
a brook which emptied Itself into a
great rier Ho turned Into the smaller
stream, ascended Its current and lis
tened to Its constant babbling as ho
went leisurely along
As he proceeded he noticed that the
brook became ery much narrower and
shallower Yet It kept up its babbling
Just the same Finally he reached" Its
head and found It to be ery Insig
nificant
"Brook," said the fish, "neer In my
life before hae I seen such a large
nioutli and heard so much babbling
with so little head behind It"

ERRORS OF HISTORY
FICTIONS THAT FOR CENTURIES HAVE
POSED AS FACTS
Wliy the Colossus of Ithodea Could
Not Hae Spanned tbe Harbor— The
Force of LeouUln at Thermopj Ijc
The William Tell Mj-th
There hae been woen Into history
Diauy Interesting stories that time and
Inestigation hae proed myths, but
In spite of the efforts of the Iconoclasts
these mistakes of history still pass
current with many people 
Probably one of the most affecting
scenes connected with the making of
literature Is that described In the oft
repeated story of the blind poet Milton
fllctating "Paradise Lost" to his daugh
ters Dr Johnson, howeer, has been
quoted as denying It He said, further
more, that Milton neer een permitted
his daughters to learn to read and
write
A faorite "piece" with western and
southern schoolboys on recitation and
exhibition days was a set of erses tell
ing of the heroic stand of Leonldas and
his brae "300" at Thermopylae The
Abbe Barthelemy, who asserted that
he had inquired minutely Into the sub
ject, wrote that, according to Diodorus,
Leonidas had 7,000 men under him and
that Pausanias gae the number of Lo
onidas' army as 12,000
Did Caesar say to the pilotPersonal
"Why do you fear? You hae Caesar
on board"
Many trustworthy historians declare
that Caesar neer used the words
quoted
The inside of cigar box coers are
sometimes ornamented with a picture
of the Colossus of Rhodes, with ships
In full sail passing between the out
stretched legs of the gigantic statue
These pictures reflect the»popular and
what for centuries was the historical
Idea of the Colossus, which was ac
counted one of the seen wonders of
the world It ' may be Interesting to
know that all drawings of the statue
are purely imaginary and, what is
more, are modern, not ancient, efforts
The Colossus was erected in 805 B O
The most trustworthy of ancient ac
counts of It Is contained In a manu
script dating about 150 B C, in which
the height of the statue is gien as 105
feet The entrance to the harbor of
Rhodes Is 350 feet across, so that It
was manifestly impossible that the legs
of the Colossus should span the en
trance to the port or that ships should
sail beneath It
As a matter of fact the Colossus was
not built across the harbor, but on an
open space of ground near It; but, for
all that, it was a wonderful statue
People whose sympathies are easily
aroused hae wept oer the %rongs
of Belisarius, the conqueror of j tH6
Vandals, who, many were taught,
"begged his bread at the city gates"
after haing commanded ictorious
armies and been of much serice to
the state The good old general was
unquestionably an unfortunate and
much abused man, but there is no
proof that he begged his liing at the
city gates or elsewhere Yet Van Dyke
engraed him and Daid, the great
Frenchman, painted him, and trage
dies and romances were written
around him In the belief that he did sit
at the city gates a forlorn and discon
solate object with palm outstretched
for alms
The facts are, a conspiracy against
the Emperor Justinian being discoer

The schoolbook tale of William Tell

Is also without foundation In fact
Tell's name doesn't een appear in the
chronicles of Zurich, and the most an
cient writing In which the story Is
mentioned bears date some 200 years
after the eent It pretends to describe
The story Is a ariation of an old Scan

Charles V of Spain on bis abdication

Coming down to later times, the peo
ple of three different countries claimed
three different men as inentors of the
steam engine In America there is a
popular belief to this day that Robert
Fulton built the first successful engine
and steamboat In England the Mar
quis of Worcester, who published an
account of a steam engine In 1663, has
receied credit for the Inention In
France Solomon de Caus (1C15) was re
garded as the genius who bad gien to
the world a new motie power Each
of them may hae conceied and work
ed out the idea of a steam engine with
out the slightest knowledge of what
had been done In that direction before
their day, but none of them might
rightly lay claim to being the first In
the field
On April 17, 1543, Don Blasco de
Garay launched a boat of 200 tons bur
den at Barcelona In the presence of the
Emperor Charles Y The bpat was pro
pelled by steam and made ten miles an
hour She was called La Sanctlssima
Trlnidada The emperor gae to Don
Blasco a handsome present; but did not
regard the Inention as practicable,
and nothing came of It From this it
would seem that Fulton was centuries
behind the times— Mew York Mail and

Jk Simple Little Trick at Once Ef-
fectie and Mysterious
Here la a trick that is always effec
tie, and, while It Is ery simple in
deed, still It Is bound to appear just a
wee bit mysterious, and many, espe
cially your little brothers and sisters,
will be unable to explain it
Take two ordinary claret glasses and
fill one to the brim with claret and the
ether equally full with clear water
Coer the top of the glass containing
water with an ordinary isiting card
so that there are no places around the
edge uncoered by the card Turn the
glass upside down and place It on the
top of the glass containing claret and
adjust the glasses so that their edges
meet exactly all the way around
Now moe the card slightly to one
Elde so that there will be a little space
at one side of the glasses inside unco
ered by a card At once a thin stream
of claret will begin to rise through this
space, not mixing with the water at
all, but Its edges clear and sharply de
fined The water, too, will begin to de
scend Into the glass containing the
claret, a pure, glistening white stream
against the ruddy red
The stream of claret, too, rising
through the sparkling white of the wa
ter presents a beautiful effect, and in a
moment the claret will begin to spread
about the top of the upper glass like
the unfolding of a red rose and the wa
ter will spread In fhe bottom of the
lower glass The two fluids will not
mix, but will present a delightful con
trast of red and white with sharply de
fined edges _-
Personal In a ery short time the "claret and
water will hae changed places, the
claret being ln the upper glass and the
water In the lower This Is due to the
difference ln weight of the liquids; wa
ter, being the heaier, forces itself Into
the lower glass, and a portion of the
claret Is moed up to take the place of
the descending water— New York ' He

CURE FOR CATARRH
A Remedy Which an Old Virginian
Says I» Infallible
An old Virginia horse breeder who Is
isiting In New York claims to hae an
Infallible cure for catarrh "It seems to
me," he said "that 90 per cent of the
people of New York city suffer more
or less from catarrh If they will do
as I suggest, they can cure themseles
In short order
"A friend of mine who used to lie
In Yonkers had such a seere case of
catarrh that he was compelled to gie
up his business and go to Colorado
The doctors told him that the high alti
tude of that state would benefit him
He remained In Colorado nearly a year
and then found himself as badly off as
when he left Yonkers 'After he had
made up his mind that nothing could
cure him and that he might as well
die at home as among strangers he met
an old tinker, who gae him the reme
dy, which cured him In three months
"Dissole a little powdered alum In a
pint of elder inegar Use the solution
as a gargle three or four times a day
It won't do any harm if you swallow
some of It Two or three times a day,
but particularly just before going to
bed, dip a chicken feather In aseline
and stick the feather up the nostrils
I suppose any contriance bought at a
drug store for the purpose will do Just
as well as a chicken feather, but the
old tinker insisted that there was some
medicinal irtue In the feather
"The gargle clears the throat and the
lower portions of the air passages from
the nostrils The aseline heals the dis
eased condition of the affected parts
In a week the sufferer will feel better,
and if he will keep up the treatment he
can be assured that he will be cured"

Slxklller'a Arm a Deadly Weapon
"Another man has been killed by a
blow of the fist, which suggests the
thought that at- times the naked fist of
a man, gien proper impetus by a well
deeloped biceps, Is an exceedingly
dangerous and destructie Instrument,"
said a man who for many years lied
at Vlnita, In the Cherokee Nation
"It recalls a bit of history local to the
Indian Territory," he continued "Not
far from the Arkansas line there lied
a half breed who went by the name of
John Sixkiller He was a bad man,
but not bad in the ordinary southwest
ern way—that Is to say,, he was'not a
'gun fighter,' although he enjoyed a
general mlxup Immensely, and until
the Cherokee council interened he In
dulged In many such affrays
"After three men whom he had laid
out' had died of thenPersonal Injuries the coun
cil (tribal legislature) met and passed
an act declaring that 'John Slxklller's
right arm Is a deadly weapon' and that
'he Is forbidden to use It against an ad
ersary except to protect himself from
death or great bodily Injury' "
