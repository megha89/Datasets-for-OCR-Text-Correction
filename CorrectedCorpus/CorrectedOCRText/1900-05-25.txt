for the timber and will be a sufficient
quantity to insure a supply for the

The Stockton Mail of "last Saturday

. to this city of tlio ittriking of oil in the
McSorley gold mim: at Camancbo, just
over the. San Joaquin county line in
Calavaras county last ««.vk. The mine
is owned by an English syndicate, and
' a shaft was down nearly 200 feet in the
blue gravel when thu oil was struck.
Its presence was first made known by
the pronounced . nmull of petroleum,
and a small flow was encountered later.
, H. J. McSorley, foreman of the mine,
instructed the men to continue to sink
to a depth of 300 feet with all possible
f-pfeed, giving special attention to oil.
indications. Operations had progressed
so far at last accounts that a good flow
of oil seemed assured. There Is con
siderable excitement in that part" of
the country over the find.
This is not the first time oil has been
encountered in Calaveras county. For
some time a spring at Mrs. Haddock's
place near Wallace has been giving
forth oil in such quantities that Mrs.
Haddock has been skimming it off
the surface of the wal«r and using- it
for fuel. .
Joe Foster of Camanche went-upPinJo
the higher mountains with another
party whose name we did not learn to
spend a few days outing, hunting, etc.,
last week. They made, their camp in
an abandoned cattle cabin above Blue
Mountain, and' on Thursday Joe
thought he would take his gun and go
out for a little small game, leaving bis
partner at the cabin. He traveled
around through the snow for a few
hours with little success and finally
concluded to return to his partner". He
started for home, supposing he was
but a short distance away, but after
wandering around till about dusk and
being no nearer home than when he
started, he shot a passing deer for
food, as he was by this time getting
very hungry^ He started • a fire and
cooked his meat, after which he made
. preparations to spend tho night in the
forest. Next morning he filled his
stomach and pockets with venison and
started out to find his temporary home
or civilization of some sort, but he had
no better success than on the day
previous, and again prepared for the
night near ' an old log, but' discovered
that he had no more matches with
which to make a fire, and was compell
ed to eat raw , venison for his supper.
The weather was very cold and as he
had no fire this night, he had to banish
the idea of sleep in ordor to use his
energies in other ways to keep from
freezing to death. He passed the sec
. ond night without, any thing serious
occurring, although a bear. some time
in the night gave him quite a scare by
approaching within a few feet of him
and critically surveying him and snuff
ing the air for a : moment, 'but finally
walked away. On Saturday morning
he again made the attempt to get out
of his predicament, and along in the
afternoon he turned up at Woodcock's
sawmill near West Point, and was in a
most exhausted and broken down con
dition. Foster's, partner had be
come alarmed and had started out for
help.

Monday morning the first serious
mishap occurred on the West Side
Flume and Lumber Company's narrow
gauge line when ten trucks, making
five cars, loaded with logs, wero backed
off the track. The accident was caused
by an open switch.
' The first reports of the ' wreck to
reach Carters were to the effect that
all the trucks were completely demol
ished, there not being enough left to
kindle a fire with.
Later more definite news was re
ceived, when it was learned that all the
trucks were naturally damaged to some
extent after rolling down an embank
ment with a mixed load of ponderous
pine saw logs, and piling up in a pro
miscuous heap, though tbe wreck was
not a : serious ' one and required but
small repairs before * everything was
again as good as new.
The wrecked log train was being
backed from a side track to the main
line by engine No. 2, engineer Jones in
charge. This side track or spur" is
located three miles this side of Camp 8.
Just who is responsible for the mis
placing of the switch that caused the

Diplomas Bestowed Upon the
Graduates.
PRESIDENT B. I. WHEELER RAKES AN ADDRESS
Grand President Bust, N. S. G. W,
Makes Grand Parlor Commit
tee Appointments.
University of California, May
17, 1900.— Vacation has begun at the
University of California. The gradu
ating exercises yesterday marked the
completion of the most notable com
mencement work ever celebrated in
Berkeley. Diplomas were bestowed
upon 256 graduates of the academic
colleges, and upon 155 graduates of the
professional schools of San Francisco;
the degree of Doctor of . Philosophy
upon Miss Jessica Blanche Peixotto
and Walter Charles Blasdale; and the
Master's degree upon a number of
candidates.
The commencement procession was
impressive. The candidates for degrees
and the members of tho faculty, . all in
cap and gown, and the rodents, alumni
and guests of honor, rnaruhed in long
procession from North Hall to the en
larged gymnasium. I'rosidont Wheeler
delivered his annual address. The
student speakers were Edwin M.
Wilder, Alfred C. Skaife, Willard G.
Parsons and Lillie E. M oiler. The
University medal was awarded to
James D. Mortimer, a student of
electrical engineering from Chicago, as
the most distinguished student' of the
graduating class.
President Wheeler dwelt upon the
great inadequacy of the University's
Income. The annual income, exclusive
of that of the Wilmerding School, is
only $420,000 per year. Harvard Uni
versity has five dollars of income for
every one that the University of Cali
fornia enjoys. The annual expenditure
per student of the University of Cali
fornia is less than $150; at the Columbia
it Is $400, and at the Harvard about
$350. ," !
Mrs. Hearst made commoncoment
week very delightful for the students
and alumni. On commencement day
she entertained fifteen hundred people
at lunch at Hearst Hall. Last Monday
she took the graduating class' by
special train to her country place In the
Llvermore Valley, La Hacienda del
Pozo de Verona, thirty-five miles south
of Berkeley, for a lunch and garden
party. Last Friday evening the soni
ors were her guests at the commence
ment ball in Hearst Hall. Saturday
evening the graduating class gave a
dinner in honor of Mrs. Hearst at tho
Palace Hotel in San Francisco.
A notable event of commencement
week was the annual public j address
last Tuesday afternoon before tho Phi
Beta Kappa society by Rev. Robert J.
Burdette of Pasadena, Mr. Burdette,
Professor Joseph La Conte, and four
men and two women of the graduating
class were on that day initiated into
Phi Beta Kappa.
The standard of scholarship of the
University has been raised by the
adoption of the rule that any student
who fails to accomplish at least five
hours of work each term to'- the
thorough satisfaction of bis instructors
shall be dropped from the rolls. Here
after there will be no discrimination
against athletes. The old rule that
the athlete must attain a standard of
scholarship not required of other
students, if he would not forfeit the
right to represent his University in
intercollegiate contests, has been re
pealed. A rule has also been establish
ed that there shall be no sin-rial exami
nations, but at the beginning of each
term re-examinations will be offered in
all courses, so that any student may
have the opportunity to make his
record clear.

A DEMOCRATIC OPINION.
A Sensible View of the Seal Value of
the' Philippine Islands.
Santa Barbara Press: "The Phila
delphia Record," belonging to the rea
sonable, rather than the hysterical class
of Democratic journals, has taken a
sensible view of the Philippine ques
tion from the beginning. The "Record"
believes the people of tire United States
capable of providing a government for
the tribes of the Philippines that will
afford them every liberty and / protec
tion, and still give this country a val
uable acquisition— valuable not only in
its material self, but as an opening to
the immense trade of t>ie great con
tinent beyond.
Commenting up'in the reported dis
covery of extensive gold deposits in the
interion of Luzon, the "Record" says:
"Readers of any life of Nelson will
recall his Interest in the Spanish vessels
which carried treasure from the Philip
pines a century ago. Under the prim
itive methods of that time gold enough
was mined to make of those Islands the
richest possession in Spain. No modern
methods have ever been applied there.
It was the deliberate policy of the Span
ish Government to keep the poeple of
the islands both poor and ignorant. To
enrich or educate them was regarded
as the surest means to promote their
rebellion; hence most of the great re
sources of the Philippines remained un
developed. Spain was satisfied to draw
some $10,000,000. annually from them,
besides the personal gains of the Span
ish officers at Manila. Every attempt
to introduce modern appliances for min
ing or working plantations was defeated
as a deliberate policy." A sugar grower
says it took him years, and cost him a
great deal of money, to get authority
to build a tramway on his 3ugar. plan*
tation. . '":" •-'••
"All travelers who have reached the
interior of the Philippines agree that
there are undeveloped resources which,
under, the direction of enlightened capi
talists with full liberty* to employ the
best machinery, would j yield immense
riches. Enough gold has been extracted
by simple means to reveal great possi
bilities. There is also iron, copper and
coal. ' The timber resources, including
mahogany and teak,' are vast, and can
easily be made profitable. Up to the
present moment the products of the
field have been the chief resources of
revenue. It is not unreasonable to think
that under the policy of this country
the mining of gold will be carried on
with great - results. . The enterprises
which are certain to follow the pacifi
cation of the islands will give ample em
ploj ment to the natives in the primitive
occupations of agriculture, lumbering,
mining and the like, and we shall have
no reason to fear the competition in
manufacturers of the Filipinos. The
idea that an indolent people reared in a
tropical climate could be induced to in
vade a northern and civilized country
to compete with its thrifty population
in industrial work or that manufactur
ing enterprises like our own, but with
cheap labor, will spring up in southern
islands, could occur only to a statesman
in need of an argument in favor of a
tariff wall between the archipelago and
the Continent. If this Government
shall adopt a sensible course the Philip
pines will prove a most valuable acqui
sition."

ARE FIGHTING FOR WATER
Colorado and Kansas Inter
.. "ests Clash.
FLOW OF TOE ARKANSAS RIVER THE GOKTENTION
Hydrographer F. H. Newell of the
Geological Surrey Talks In
terestingly.
After years of threatening, the Su
preme Court of the United States is to
be asked to decide the case of Kansas
against Colorado In the matter of the
diversions of the Arkansas river In the
latter State. This river in Kansas
flows through some thirteen counties,
forming a valley of 2,500,000 acres,
almost as rich as the valley of the Nile.
The claim made. is that Colorado has
diverted so much of the water of the
river as to seriously damage Kansas
farmers.
. Commenting upon this litigation be
tween the two statos, Mr. F. H. Newell
having charge of the irrigation survey
ings of the Geological Survey, made
some interesting remarks. "That
trouble would sooner or later ensue,"
Mr. Newell said, "between these two
states over water rights,' has been for a
long lime evident . to people familiar
with the conditions affecting them. A
number of years ago the Geological
Survey undertook some important sur
veys of Colorado with a view to deter
mining the perennial water supply of
its rivers and its capacity for .water
storage. The rivers heading in Colo
rado furnish a vast water . supply and
the sites available for reservoiring the
flood waters of these streams are very
numerous. Our work enabled us to
locate and survey a largo number of
such sites, but there are hundreds of
others, although right in the midst of
the work af making these- surveys, . we
were cut off through lack of appropri
ation. .. .1,-;  .
COSTLY LITIGATION.
"Very expensive litigation is likely
to result from this attompt of Kansas
to compel Colorado to stop using water
and I think when they get through
with it, they will be just about where
they are to-day. I cannot but think
that if this expense could be devoted
to the continuation of the work upon
which the government surveyors were
engaged some years ago, a definite
knowledge would be obtained as to the
possibilities of, supplying both States
with a water supply on a business basis.
• "If the floods of the rivers flowing
through these States were properly
conserved in storage reservoirs -there
would be enough water to supply all
the lands at present under, irrigation,
and to vastly increase the irrigated
area, whereas now there is a scant and
unreliable supply even for that land
which is said to be 'under irrigation.' "
"How would a proper distribution 'of
water between the two States be effect
ed, if all the water possible should be
stored? 1 '
"It would necessarily have to be
through some third disinterested party
acting as agent, and in whom both
States would have confidence. I
believe that in a general inter-State
matter of this kind the federal govern
ment is the most logical and natural
party to decide and administer such a
case equitable and satisfactorily."
A GREAT WASTE OF MONEY.
"There are other cases are there not,
besides the Arkansas river which are
likely to cause trouble and litigation:?"
"Dozens. This is simply one of
many. Litigation must necessarily en
sue between Colorado and Nebraska,
between Colorado and Wyoming; in
fact until some general system such as
I have suggested Is adopted, there will
be lawsuits and controversies between
States wherever a river crosses from
one State to another, which will in
volve an aggregate cost of enormous
proportions, while the outcome cannot
in any case be satisfactory. It appears
to mo to be very largely the old
question of people who should be good
neighbors, fighting, over a dividing
fence and wasting time and money
enough to build a good bull-tight fence
instead of getting together in the be
ginning and co-operating. If the irri
gation interests in question would come
together and bend their efforts towards
getting the government to complete its
half finished work of reservoir survey
ings in that section, then the matter
would be in such condition as to enable
the parties in interest to proceed intilli
gently on a definite basis."
Guy E. Mitchell.
IRRIGATION APPROPRIATION.
The irrigation appropriation 0f5250,
000 which is asked for the use of the
Geological Survey, would enable that
bureau to vigorously prosecute its
needful work of getting at the facts
concerning the water possibilities of the
arid region, and making surveys to
show definitely where water can be
stored, lh what quantities and how
much there will be to store. These are
all subjects of vital interest to arid
America and which Congress owes it to
the West to provide for liberally.

' ' * Beneficial to California.
"' (From the San Francisco Post.)
Colonel Ben C. Truman, one of Cali
fornia's Commissioners' to the Paris
Exposition, has written an interesting
letter on matters pertaining to ' his of
fice to the Los Angeles "Western
Graphic." As Commissioner Colonel
Truman has had opportunities of view

parisons are of an. instructive, nature.
In speaking of the exnibit which the
Southern Pacific Company sent to the

quality and j will do the /state an im

one of the most energetic as well as one
of the most brilliant ' men . living, be

"I've got a little touch of indigestion,

The one medicine for disorders and
diseases of the stomach and organs of
digestion and nutrition is Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery. It increases
the activity of the whole digestive and
nutritive system, clears away obstruc-
tions, stops the loss the body sustains by
undigested or partly digested food, pun-
fies the blood from the poisons resulting
from imperfect digestion, and increases
the secretions of- the blood-making

called "hopeless" cases.

While the Naval Appropriation bill was being discuss-
Ed, Senator Lodge, in a short speech, gave what is generally
considered as an official notice to Europerthat this govern
ment is prepared to fight to maintain;: the Monroe Doctrine,
if necet-sary. The Monroe Doctrine is by the way the one
important question upon which there is no political division
in the Senate. During his speech, Senator Lodge incident
ally served notice on Germany that no dickering for the pos
\ session of the Danish West Indies would be tolerated by this
government. It was not a jingo speech, but a plain state
ment of the situation. His speech made a sensation in di
plomatic circles, and was cabled in full to all of the great
European powers. The following extract from the speech
has pith in it: . "My reason for desiring more ships and de
siring them quickly is my belief that the safety of the U. S.
depends upon the strength of our Navy. We do not need
the Navy for the protection of our insular possessions. The
danger lies in our great coast line and in the defense of the
Monroe Doctrine in this Hemisphere." Of the relation of a
stronger Navy to the Isthmian Canal, Mr. Lodge said: "We
are about to enter upon the construction of an Isthmian
canal, and we must be the navai masters of the Carribean
Sea. We must have a more powerful fleet than we have
today. The safety of the canal depends upon the strength of
our Navy. All admit that the canal ought to be built, and
the time is near when the work will be begun. •If we are to
protect the canal as well as our own coast, we must have a
navy proportionately strong. I hope and believe that we
shall have no war, but a great fleet is the best insurance of
peace. However, we would be foolish, indeed, if we should
close our e3'es to the possibilities of the situation. We could
never allow the Danish islands to pass into any other
hand than ours. Any European nation which should un
dertake to take possession of those islands, right on the road
to the Canal, and to make them a great naval station, would
by that very act become an enemy of ours. We could submit
to no such thing as that." \
Santa Rosa Press-Democrat: Next summer 1,450 Cuban
school teachers, at the invitation of Harvard Uuivers^, will
spend six weeks in Cambridge, Mass., for instruction in the
English language. These teachers, two-thirds of whom are
women, have recently been appointed to take charge of the
schools in Cuba, and, as their salaries range from $30 to $75
a month, they could not hope to make this visit unaided.
The authorities of Harvard have guaranteed $70,000 for their
use, the War Department taking them to Boston on Govern
ment transports and returning them from New York in the
same way. No tuition fees will be charged. The plan is for
the women to lodge in private houses by invitation and tlfe
* men in college rooms placed at their service by students.
I They will also be instructed in geography by illustrated lec
;tures and excursions,; in the history of Spanish-American
colonies, on American school, public libraries and a number
;-of American industries. ThiVis a most commendable under
taking, for. the initiation, of which credit is due to President
&Eliot... -, , V
V lIIAY _ shortage m the accounts of C. F. W. Neeley, who
has I«en financial agent of the Cuban Postal System, has
been greatly exaggerated/ The full report of Col. Burton, of
the Inspector General's Department of the army, who discov
ered the shortage, is in the hands of Secretary Root. It
shows a shortage of $36,000 for the current year and impli
cates nobody but Neeley, who is under arrest and will be
speedily tried and. punished, if found guilty. That is the
whole story, which has been magnified out of all proportion
to its importance by the democratic press for the purpose of
trying to make political capital. President McKinley has
directed Gen. Wood to make a thorough investigation of all
Cuban financial accounts, and there will be no chance for any
guilty man to escape exposure and punishment. Mr. A. L.
Lawshe, Deputy Auditor for the Post Office Department has
been ordered to Cuba to take the place of the Auditor of
Cuban postal accounts, who has been suspended during the
investigation.
. The Democrats appear to be afraid to publicly express
opinions about Towne's nomination for Vice-President by the
Sioux City Populist Convention. On the quitt, however, the
leaders of the party are saying many harsh things about Sen
, ators, Butler and Pettigrew, who are charged with responsibil
ity for Towne's nomination.
Senator Spooner will probably have the distinguished
honor of presenting President McKinley's name to the Phila
delphia Convention. He will do justice to the subject and (o
the occasion. Among the prominent men who will make
speeches seconding the nomination will be Governor Roose
velt: of New York. •

Election of School Trustees.
The Attorney : General of: the State
and the various Attorneys of
the counties are tussling with the ques
tion whether the coming election of
school trustees must be held under the
old or the new registration. If under
the old registration, the old register
will have to be used; if under the new
registration, the time is already past
within which to register for this par
ticular election. . It, is claimed, how
ever, that the provisions of the Smith
law do not contemplate elections for
school trustees. If the old register is
defunct and can not be used, and if the
new law is not adapted to such elec
tions, then what?
THE PHILIPPINE WAR.
May 17.— Filipinos seem to be bent
upon keeping up hostilities for some

pine Commissioners were appointed

and cannot act officially. — Several
severe fights were engaged in with
groat lo3s to rebels.
May 20.— Doath for the Navarro
mutineers. Filipino natives avenge tho
tragedy aboard the vessel and 'execute
the ringleaders.
May 21.— Eighty Americans are' am
bushed, but rout the insurgents, killing
fifty-one.
May 22.— Tagals confine the Ameri
cans to coast towns.— Geueral Bell in
need of reinforcements in Southern
Luzon.— At Doosol Major Wise with
two companies of troops is beseiged by
a thousand insurgents.
May 23. — Force of insurgents yield to
Americans. General Mac Arthur re
ports the surrender of two companies
at Tarlac.
Register at Once.
It is well known to the readers of the
Ledger that under the Smith regis
tration law, a new registration of
voters must be had to entitle electors
to voto at the next general election.
Not only is this true, but no one will be
entitled to vote at the next primary
who is not on the new Register, as that
primary must be conducted under the
new registration act. It is the duty of
members of all political parties to reg
ister at once, and see' that they are
registered in the correct precinct.

Brought to the Hospital.
Last Monday about noon. Deputy
Constable Heffren brought a Chinaman
from lone and placed him in the County
Hospital. Opium consumption was
probably the disease with which the
Chinaman was afflicted. Tho trip was
necessarily very slow and many times
Heffren thought his charge was dead,
but ho managed to cling to life several
days after his entrance into the hospital.
As he wa-* being brought through
Jackson, his right hand grasping the
lazy-back of the seat, his head thrown
back and with mouth open gasping for
breath, his , groans indicated the in
tense suffering, and it was thought he
would die,^ before he arrived at the
hospital.
Tuesday night the moans and groans
of the sufferer as he lay in the agonies of
death, disturbed the rest of the other
inmates, and death was considered a
welcome visitor to tho unfortunate.

The Basket Picnic.
Last Saturday was a" lively day at
Plymouth, tho basket picnic given
jointly by tho Native Daughters and
ladies of the Catholic church meeting
with more than ordinary success. In
the morning a procession was formed
and marched out to the picnic ground,
which is an excellent location, beaded
by the Preston School Band.
After the literary exercises in the
morning and lunch had been had, the
sports of the day commenced, the chief
featuro being the game of baseball
between the Amador City and Jackson
nines. It is said to have been the
poorest game ever played in this
county. At any rate the Jackson club
met with an overwhelming defeat.
This is what comes of not practicing.
The result of thi3 game causes consid
erable comment on tho game to be
played between the same teams at the
Italian picnic. •
A dance was given in the evening
and wa9 thoroughly enjoyed by par
ticipants, j
A large number of people from ad
joining towns were present and all vote
the affair one ot well deserved success.

CALAVERAS COUNTY-
Prospect: The new pump for the
Kentucky, mine near the Kentucky
House has arrived on the grounds, and
Mr. Sceifert is making , arrangements
to have it put in position at once. As
soon as the pump is placed, work will
be resumed sinking the main shaft' and
fully developing the property.
The old Shear mine on Central Hill,
better known as the Lloyd mine, has
recently been bonded to Don Palmer,
who formerly successfully operated the
Chili Hill mine. Work will commence
within sixty days, and . there is no
doubt but that the mine will prove a
good paying proposition. . The Central
Hill group of mines have all been rich
ever since the early days, and all it
needs is a little money to open them
E. C. Stanley, formerly of Robin
son's Ferry, where he disposed of some
valuable mining property, is now living
at Copperopolis, and is still making
- mining his chief business. Last Satur
day he was in San Andreas in the in
terest of tbe Box mine, which is a con
tinuation of the famous Pine Log mine
at Hobson. There is a good prospect
that this property will soon be opened,
and there is little doubt but that it will
prove as productive as the Pine Log.
All it needs is sufficient money to open
it properly. The ledge is the . same as
the Pine Log and can be traced as
plainly as a village street. San . Fran
cisco parties are looking after the' mine
and a bond is likely to be given as soon
as the terms are satisfactorily ar
ranged.
The Ford Mining Company will start
their ten-stamp mill to crushing rock
from the mine in a short time. Ar
rangements are being made with the
Standard Electric Company for power,
and as soon as they can get ready the
stamps will begin to drop, probably
within a week. THe rock that is being
taken out now looks very promising,
and extensive tests will be made on ore
from different parts of the mine. The
officers of the company seem to be very
much encouraged over the recent de
velopments in the mine.
Citizen: A large amount of iron pipe
has been passing through town lately
/or the Sheep Ranch mine. A large
number of men are employed there and
all Is moving along nicely.
The Goldwin mine of Tuolumne
county is having a large amount of ma*
chinery made at Alta ville for the prop
erty. Vast improvements, including a
ten -stamp mill are contemplated. '
Chronicle: The French Hill tunnel
near town, which for the past nine or
ten months has been driven ahead,
under the management of J. E. Burton
with a view to tap the quartz ledge
that passes through? French Hill, is
completed, the ledge having been
atruck Thursday last. The formation
through which this tunnel was driven,
a depth of 480 feet, was very hard - and
the work was necessarily slow.. The
calculations were found to be about
correct as the ledge was struck within
\*n or twelvt fwt of where It was sup.
posed to be. The vein at the point en
counteietl is about five feet in- width,
with well defined walls, and. shows a'
good prospect in free gold. Further
exploration will be necessary to deter
mine the value of the find, but at
present everything looks very favor
able. 3-r ;„ •;.- -
 The Lightner Mining company of
Angels Camp is using - a diamond drill
to tap the old works of the Fox mine,
which are filled with water. This
water, when the works are tapped, will
be pumped out through the Lightner.
This method was deemed expedient in
order to guard against any probable
accident from' breaking into the old
drifts or levels of the Fox mine. The
Lightner company evidently does not
believe in the theory that men are
cheaper than the exercise of proper
precautionary measures.
The crushing of eighty tons of ore
from the Maioney mine, in the Giuffra
mill, was finished last Tuesday and the
batteries and plates were cleaned up.
The result was 20} ounces of amalgam.
The San Pedro mine at I Glencoe,
owned by C. A. Berry, was bonded last
week to Mr. Hart for $11,000, and the
first payment of $1000 was made. A
new hoist is to be erected at once and
operations will be pushed forward as
rapidly as possible.

Nothing is really known as to the
time when the Santa Ysabel mine will

culation that work will . commence at
once with No. 3 shaft as the center of
development, but it is only rumor and
in this case the wish is probably father
to the thought.

The development . work now being
actively prosecuted on the Arrow mine
situated about one and a half -miles
south of Souls by ville, is showing ex
ceedingly well. The ore carries a high

j/A, Guardian Appointed.
The case, in which the a-uardianship
of the six-year-old child of Mrs. M.
Weeks was applied for by Mrs. Mattie
E. Anderson, district deputy of the
Children's Home Finding Society of
San Jose, and also by Mr. Fred Wick
ers, grandfather of the child, was con
cluded Monday in the Superior Court
of this county.
The case has excited considerable in
terest, and is the first case of Mrs.
Anderson, since her connection with
the society, of which H. W. Brayton
is superintendent.
The child had been taken in charge
by the Children's Home Finding Soci
ety, and was placed in the home of Mr.'
and Mrs. G. W. Thompson, parents of
District Deputy Mfs. Anderson, near
Amador City, and had been a member
of the household about ten weeks, $3 a
week being allowed for its support.
"Recently Mr. .Wickers, grandfather*
of - the child, applied for letters of
guardianship, as also did Mrs. Ander
son. The case was brought before the
Superior Court and after pathetic ap
peals had lieen made for both parties
by their respective attorneys, Judge
Rust rendered his decision Tuesday
to the effect that the grandfather was
awarded the guardianship of the child.
Shortly after the dicision was rendered
Mr. Wickers left for Amador City and
upon filing a bond of $500 took charge
of the child and two or three days later
left for his home. '
A Pleasing Performance.
The Guernevillo X-Rays of the 12th
inst., has" the following to say of the
O'-Malley Sisters Company which will
entertain in^ Webb Hall, Jackson,
Friday, June Ist:
.^Tho O'Malley Sisters Company
gave a very enjoyable performance at
Union Hall on Thursday"ovening, the
dancing and singing of the sisters and
little Edwin being of a high order of
excellence and eliciting hearty applause
and encores from the audience. Rob
ert Lee's sleight-of-hand performances
were well dono and sufficiently myster
ious to keep the audience wondering,
and his juggling with cups, balls and
flying knives was somewhat startling.
Prof. O'Malley does nicely on the
trombone, violin or piano and is en
titled to great credit for giving a lively
up-to-date show. Last and of equal
importance to newsgetters, he always
affords every facility for obtaining full
reports of the successes scored by his
accomplished performers; we hope that
they will again return to Guorneville
and our Russian River Valley.
Were Separated Forty-Six Years.
The California Miner of the 17th in
stant has the following:
"Forty-six years ago J. H. Lowry,
now of Pine . Grove, Amador county,
stopped over at Salt Lake city, Utah,
on his way to California and visited his
brother, J. Lowry, a well-known citi
zen of Salt Lake. This is the last time
the brothers met until a couple of
weeks ago J. Lowry (accompanied by
his daughter) came on from Utah to
visit his brother at Pine Grove. When
the '47 pioneer of Utah and the '49
pioneer of California met in tho little
mining town up in Amador county
they embraced and kissed each other
like two school girls. The meeting
was a happy one, and the touching
sight brought tears to the eyes of more
than one . to see ' the meeting of the
brothers after 46 years of separation.
Fire at Plymouth.
Tuesday night about 11:30 o'clock the
old Ludwick house at the south end of
Plymouth, was totally destroyed iby
fire. The house was unoccupied and
contained but a few useful articles. ;.-: f
Shortly after the fire was discovered
an alarm was sent in to the fire depart
ment, and in a few minutes, the hose
cart was wheeled into place where a
hydrant was supposed to be located,
but upon investigation it was' found
that several hydrants in that vicinity
had been removed somet ime previous
by the ditch tender and the fire de
partment was powerless to check the
raging: flames.
Considerable comment is made on
the actions of the water company, and
it will probably be asked to replace the
hydrants. \

DEATH MAKES A CLAIM.
After Eight Years of Sickness H. M.
Smith Passes Away.
Last Sunday morning about 7 o'clock
Harry M. Smith passod away at his
late home at Jackson, after battling
with life for more than sixty years.
His death closed an eight, years siege
of illness.  ;.:-";;
Harry M. Smith was born in Eng
land October 13, 1839. .In 1870 he
crossed the broad Atlantic and settled
in the United States. Seventeen years
ago he came to Jackson with his family
and here he lived to the time of his
death. In 1885 he became superinten
dent of the County Hospital and re
mained as such until 1893,' when the
superintendency was given to , S. H.
Hawkins. Instead of regaining his
health, which at that time was in a
some-what shattered condition, he be
gan to get worse, and for the past 8
years had been steadily failing until
last Sunday morning when the end
came.
The burial took place Tuesday after
noon at the Protestant cemetery, Rev.
F. A. Morrow officiating. '.''•'
FALLS TO HIS DEATH.
A Miner Falls Down a Manhole a
Hundred and Forty Feet.
Last Saturday afternoon there hap
pened a fatal accident in the South
Eureka mine near Sutter Creek. -John
Garbarini, an Italian minor of consider
able experience, _was at. work in the
shaft of the mine, and wishing to de
scend to the next tunnel below, stepped
to tho man-hole. - Across the man-hole
was a piece of spiling upon which he
rested one foot, while with the other
he reached for the ladder, jirhm the
spiling slipped, and losing his balance,
he fell down the shaft a distance of one
hundred and forty feet. He was soon
found, bruised,  bleeding, and uncon
scious. ; Willing hands placed, him in
the skip and he was brought to the
surface. ' A physician was immediately
summoned but ' all efforts to prolong
the life of the injured man were in vain
and about 4 ' o'clock Sunday morning
he fell into that sleep which "knows no
waking." 
Undertaker Roberts "of Sutter Creek
prepared the body 'for burial Sunday
morning, and Monday the remains
were interred in the Jackson cemetery
with Catholic ceremonies.
Deceased had formerly been a resi
dent of Jackson, being employed in the
mines here, and had lived in this county

Georgia Favalli, son of Mr. and Mrs.
John Favalli,. was playing^with his lit
tle bister last Saturday evening at his

rhe Various Ways In Which It May
Be Accomplished.
The various way* In which a cold
may be brought on are thus describ
ed by Dr. J. H. Kellogg: "A little knife
blade of air blowing in through a
crack In a window upon some part-of
the body will chill that part, and the
blood vessels of that region will be
come contracted, affecting somewhere
In the interior. of the body an area in
if (lex relation with tills portion of the
surface of the body. .
.' "For instance, the blood vessels of the
skin of the top of the shoulders and
the chest are associated with the blood
vessels of the lungs, so that whatever
happens to the blood vessels of the
skin of the shoulders and chest hap
pens also to the blood vessels of the
lungs. If there is a contraction of the
blood vessels of the back of the neck,
there will be a contraction of the blood
. vessels of the nose and throat, and If
there is a contraction of the blood ves
sels of the top of tbe shoulders and
the shoulder blades there will also be
a contraction of the. blood vessels of
the lungs. When the influence of the
cold is continued, this contraction is
followed by congestion.
"When one puts his hands into cold
water for a few minutes, they are first
pale and then red. This is reaction.
- The longer the application and tbe
more intense the degree of cold the
greater will be the contraction and the
congestion. So if the back of the neck
is exposed for a long time to the Influ
ence of cold one is likely to have a
cold in tbe nose and throat If the
shoulder blades and tbe tops of the
shoulders are exposed, one is likely to
'take cold In tbe lungs and suffer from
congestion of the lungs. If the cold Is
long continued, it may cause not only
a congestion, but an Inflammation of
the nose or the lungs.
"So If tbe bottoms of the feet become
. wet or chilled a weakness of the blad
. der may result if tbere has ever been a
trouble there or a weakness of the
stomach if tbere has been a catarrh of
that organ."— Good Health.
BABY'S PRETTY CURLS.
Pmlled Tliem OS In m. Car and I3m
.' barnsicd Her Mamma.
A well dressed woman with a beauti
ful baby in her arms attracted tbe at
tention of all the passengers on a Ger
mantown car. Every one was fasci
nated by the baby's pretty and smiling
face 'and particularly by two golden
curls which hung down her cheeks! •.
After awhile the child became nerv
ous and began to tug at one of the
curls which protruded from her hood.
The woman, presumably her mother,'
1 quickly stopped her, but a few mo
ments later she looked out of the win
dow. No sooner was her face turned
than the child seized her bonnet with
both hands and pulled it off. It offer
. cr little resistance, but to the astonisb-
J ment of every one on the car the curls
came with it, and the supposed golden
haired baby showed that in reality its
head was without the semblance of a
hair.
Tbe child swung the bonnet to and
fro and laughingly held it up for the
inspection of the other passengers. It
was almost a minute before the wom
an turned around. When she saw
what : the baby had done, her face
flushed, 'and without a word she pick
ed up the child and walked sedately
out of the car. ' When last seen, sbe
was trudging down Spring Garden
street with the baby tucked under her
arm like a sack of oats/ but still hold-
Ing tightly to the bonnet and cooing,

Behind the Scenes.
"A' good many people," said a veter
an stage manager the other day, "have
an idea that .beyond the scenes of a
stage there Is great fun and hilarity
and tbat actors have a jolly sort of
time between their appearances before
the audience. The fact is a military
camp during times of inspection is no
more* sedate than is the rear of any
well regulated stage when the public
In front of the footlights is being en
tertained. The shifting of scenes and
the proper execution of an intricate
play require all the thought that can
be given them. All the men and women
have all they can do to properly per
form their parts. If a manager Is an
easy going man, caring little for dis
cipline, he soon gets to the end of his
career. You may be «ure there is no
business that Is carried on in a more
businesslike way than is the play-
house, and when the fun is on in the
front those behind the scenes are care
* fully watching to see that no hitch oc
curs and that every ode is ready to do
bis part at the proper time and does
it properly when the time comes."—

How to Dry Rubber Boots.
It was a problem how to dry out hip
rubber boots. In the sitting room there
was an open grate fire which was cov
ered every night with fine coal and a
few shovelfuls of ashes, so that the 1
room never becanje quite cold. We
found that if we heated a piece of old
flannel as hot as possible and stuffed It
down into the foot of a boot and stood
the boot in front of the fireplace It
was as dry as a bone next morning.
The handiest thing to keep the boot leg
. open is a spring steel corset rib about
18 Inches long by three-quarter Inch
in width.— Forest and Stream.
Out of Sight.
An English cotton buyer in Memphis
-was talking with the clerk of one of
the hotels the other day when a com
mercial traveler came up. "How you
feeUng, BUI?" Bald the clerk as he ex
tended his hand. "Oh, I'm Just out of
sight," replied the drummer.
After the commercial man had been
assigned his room the Englishman
turned to the clerk and inquired what
he meant by "out of sight." The clerk
explained that he meant he was feel
ing fine, and the Englishman recorded
it in his little book.
The next morning when he same
down to breakfast the clerk, following
his usual custom, asked how be felt.
The Englishman thought it a good time
.to try some of his newly learned slang
and, with the air of one who has solv
ed a difficult problem, replied, "Oh,
you kaun't see me at all!"— Memphis

Motion and Color.
The relations between light and the
eye are wonderful, and the rapidity of
the vibrations of the atmosphere nec
essary to produce color sensations are
amazing. To get the sensation of red
ness our eyes are affected 482,000,000
times in a second; of yellowness, 540,
000,000, and of violet, 707,000,000, So
that the seven hued rainbow, whose
firm and subtle flame is reared out of
drops of water that are ever shifting,
plays upon the human eye in a manner
bo astounding that the strongest mind
might stagger beneath the awful reve
latlon.—J^ondon Opinion,

A TRAMP AND HIS PAL
THE TRAIL THAT ONE MADE TO GUIDE
THE OTHER.
It Enabled - Appetite Bill," After Hla
Terra In Jail Wan Done, to Unerr
ingly Follow His Partner Prom
Cincinnati to Houston.
"We have a good many tramps up In
our part of the country," said a sugar
planter, "and I've made something of a
Btudy of their peculiarities. The old
idea that they carve marks and signs
on fences that can be read by all other
members of the frat<"-nlty is pure non
sense, of course, but nave known sev
eral instances in which one tramp
would leave a trail, so to speak, for the
guidance of a partner who might not
put in an appearance for months.
"The first case of that kind I ever
encountered waa rather amusing. I
was riding, one spring day, down a
road that passes through my^-place,
when I noticed a typical hobo indus
triously carving a sort of hieroglyphic
on a big post standing near the fence.
The mark consisted of a square and
triangle side by side, and he was just
putting on the finishing touches as I
arrived.
"My curiosity was at once aroused,
and I determined to find out if possible
exactly what the thing meant, so I pro
ceeded to collar the fellow, and after a
little vigorous bluffing he told me he
was putting up directions for his part
ner, who would be along some time in
the fall. He assured me that the marks
meant nothing in particular, except
that he had passed and was going In
the direction of the point of the trian
gle. ' •
"His partner, according to the story
which I dragged out of him piecemeal,
was doing. a six months' jail sentence
for slugging a policeman in Cincinnati
and when he got out on Sept 1 would
strike south, following a trail of carv
ings on water tanks, depots, barns and
fencepoftts. When the first tramp
struck a good place to loaf, he proposed
to stop and wait for the other to catch
up.
'"What's your partner's name?' I
asked. '.; 
" 'It's by rights William Sparks,' said
the hobo, 'but everybody calls him
"Appetite Bill" on account of his al
ways being hungry. He carries a sack
to pnek grub in and has red whiskers
and a funny looking wart on one side
of his nose.'
"I was satisfied from my prisoner's
manner that he was telling me the
truth, so I took him up to the house,
gave him a good dinner and sent him
on his way rejoicing.
"Now for t^»e sequel," continued the
planter. "One afternoon in the fall I
was driving home from the station
when I passed a very dilapidated hobo
with red stubble on his chin and a gun
ny sack under bis arm, and some in
stinct told me that Mr. Sparks, alias
•Appetite Bill,' had at last arrived.
He seemed to be looking for land
marks, and when he reached the big
post I saw him stop, scrutinize the
carving and then start off with a new
and confident 'step. Tbat settled it,
and I drove ahead and intercepted him
at the house, half a mile farther on.
"•Hello, BUI!' I said. 'How's your
appetite this evening?'
" 'Appetite?" he stammered and gave
such a violent start that be dropped
his gunny sack.
" 'Why, yes,' said I. 'Perhaps they
didn't feed you very well at Cincin
nati.'
"At the word Cincinnati he turned
livid and glared around with such evi
dent intention of bolting that I made
haste to explain.
"'Don't be alarmed,' I said. 'I met
your side partner a few months ago,
and he told me to look out for you.' It
took me some time to dissipate Bill's
suspicions, but when I finally, succeed
ed in convincing him that It was all
right he told me a most interesting
story of his journey across the coun
try.
"A professional hobo will follow the
track of another hobo with an accura
cy tbat is curiously suggestive of wood
craft. All the way down from Cincin
nati BUI had never once lost the trail,
and before he left I gave him an ad
dressed postal card and got him to
promise me he would put It In the mall
at whatever point he caught up with
his partner. Less than a month later I
received the card, bearing a Houston
(Tex.) date mark; so I presume it was
there they met. !
"Both of these tramps could read and
write, and I asked Sparks particularly
why his friend didn't use some brief
message in place of the hieroglyph.
He replied that It would attract too
much attention, and other hoboes
would be likely to add misleading
words, while the little square and tri
angle passed unnoticed.
"Since then I have encountered two
other nearly similar cases, in each of
which a tramp was leaving a cipher
trail for a crony to follow when he got
out of jail, and I infer that the prac
tice Is tolerably common. At any rate
It is a curious feature of tramp life
which I have never seen mentioned In
any of the numerous papers and maga
zine articles that have appeared on the
subject during recent years."— New Or

Stjott Flea..
One of the strangest of all specks on
snow- is the snow flea — no mimic flea,
but an actual living and very lively
midget, whose swarms sometimes cov
er the snow In patches as black as Ink
or convert large spaces of its surface
to a dark gray color. They are crea
tures of the thaw. I have seen patches,
say's William Hamilton Gibson, two
feet in diameter moving like a dark
shadow across the meadow, and I re
member once when a boy walking on
the snow crust over a field of several
acres that was everywhere peppered
with their millions.
The books tell us that the insects live
In moss and lichens and the rocks and
bark of trees, from which they emerge
for exercise in mild weather. This
theory is probably warranted by the
facts, but It will be no easy task so to
convince many a rustic philosopher
whom I know and to whom these fleas
are as much a celestial shower as the
now itself.— Boston Transcript.

rsteea.
This wild west of Ireland is the nat
ural home of "poteen," or illicit whis
ky. This Is because the loneliness and
remoteness of the spots chosen for
making it, almost inaccessible through
the mountains and bogs save to those
who know something about the coun
try, are all in favor of the smugglers
escaping detection, while Its network
of mountain lakes and small running
Btreanis affords. the necessary cold wa
ter for condensing the distilled fumes
bto spirit during the cooling process.
Dear beyond any "parliament whis
ky"—by which expression he denotes
that sort which has paid the tax Impos
ed by the brutal Saxon government—'
Is this fiery fluid to the heart of every,
true peasant son of Connaugbt,' and
aaughter.too.'for that matter, for the
fair sex, especially if at all up in years,
takes Its fair share. And, In the Inter
est of truth, It must be added that
those who inhabit the coast counties
from Kerry to Donegal. Inclusive, are
also fully alive to Its seductive merits.
Indeed, many doctors— local, of course
—will tell you that well made poteen
is better in sickness than the adulter
ated whisky usually met with In the
small public bouses In this region of
poverty, for In the Connemara country
at any rate the illicit whisky Is made
of pure malt, though rumor has it that
the less particular palate of Donegal,
for instance. Is satisfied with a fire
water mainly made from molasses, po
tatoes — aye, sometimes from almost
any other rubbish you please.—Cham

Patrols on Russian Railroads.
The Transsiberian railroad Is,, very
closely guarded, the management feel-
Ing personally responsible for tbe peo
ple they carry on their trains. The
road is divided into sections of one
verst, or five-eighths of a mile. In a
neat little log. house, usually In a gar
den, live the guard and his people. The
average family is a wife and five tow
beaded j children. The houses were
built by . the company ; and evidently
with a view to. meeting the demands
of increasing families. The guard or a
member of his family must patrol his
section night and day. He steps to the
side of tl*e track as' the train ap
proaches and after It has passed steps
back into the middle of the track, holds
a small green flag in tbe air. at night a
lantern, and stands like a statue until
the train has entered tbe next section.
Several guards do duty In the heavy
curves, and frequently they are only a
few hundred feet apart.
Much of tbe track patrolling is done
by women, who have proved fully as
reliable as the men. The women are
nearly always barefooted, and as they
stand on the track holding the ' flag
aloft, a Siberian breeze toying 'with
their short skirts, they, are fine sub
jects for a sculptor after a unique mod
el.—Siberian (Letter In Chicago Record.
Seeing: and Knnirinit.
An eminent  lord chief Justice who
was trying a right of way case had be
fore him a witness, an old farmer, who
was proceeding to tell the jury that he
had "knowed the path for CO year, and
my feyther towld I as he beard my
grandfeyther say"— > '
"Stop! 1 cried the judge. "We can't
have any hearsay evidence here."
"Noi!" exclaimed Fanner Giles.
"Then how dost know who thy feyther
was, 'cept by hearsay?"
After the laughter had subsided the
judge said, "In courts of law, we can
only be guided by what you have seen
with your eyes and nothing more nor
less." „ t
"Oh, that bte blowed for a tale!" re
plied the farmer. "I ha' got a bile on
the back of my neck, and I never seed
'un, but I be prepared to swear, he's
there, dang 'un!"
This second triumph on the part of
the witness set in a torrent of hearsay
evidence about the footpath.' which ob
tained ' weight with the Jury, nlbell the
judge told them it was not testimony
of any value, and the farmer's party
won.  : 
Grandfather's Hymns.'

ing "grandfather's" hymns: "Imagine
them and their good wives gathered in

book preserves for us:
"Then, blooming friends, a lone farewell;
We're bound to heareri, but you to hen.
Still God may hear us while we pray .
And change you ere the burning day.
"And, be it observed, this 'burning
day' to them' was something as definite
as washing day. This was none _of
your vague purgatorial way stations,
but as fiery a pit of torment as tbe
Imagination can well conceive. Here
Is a glimpse of It:

A Trick That Didn't Wqrk Unt Jut

There were three of them, and as
they entered the German saloon on the
corner the tall young man, who wore
razzle ! dazzle 'clothes and I posed as

his companions that he would "show
them something good."
They lined up at tbe J>ar, and the
tall young man orderecfthree 6 cent
drinks. 'When these were disposed of,
tie laid down 10 cents on the bar, at
which the German proprietor remark
ed. "Neln; flfdeen." The tall young
man repocketed the coin and thus ad
dressed the German: ' ,
"I Just'gaveyou 10 cents, didn't I?"
"Yah."* responded the German.
—"Well, here's 10 cents. That makes
20. so you owe me 5," added the
young man, again depositing the dime
on the bar.
The German looked bewildered, but
placed. the dime in tbe money drawer
and banded the tall young man a half
dollar, with tbe request that He deduct
therefrom the 6 cents due him. The
tall young man bad just the correct
change. 45 cents, left In his pocket
This he promptly handed to tbe Ger
man and received the half dollar. Then
the three companions repaired to the
street and Indulged in a mighty laugh,
while tbe tall young man swelled up
like a prize turkey on parade. Every
thing went lovely until they parted
company and the j tall young man
boarded a car for his . home in the
suburbs. Imagine his feelings when
the conductor banded him back tbe
60 cents which he tendered in re

TRAINING OF ANIMALS:
Only Accomplished, It Is Said, by the
Uae of the Whip.
The popular theory tbat auliuals can :
be taught tricks by firmness and kind- |
ness Is a grim error, according to a vet- j
eran circus man who has sent forth
the dictum that no. animal was ever
trained to do anything unnatural ex
cept by punishment. If It knows hun
ger or pain will follow disobedience. It .
will-obey. . \
It takes the whip to break tbe colt to
harness or saddle, but the [end justifies
the means.' and the animal's intelli
gence when once it has learned its les
son does away with further use of the
whip. But If a horse is taught tricks,
such as one sees In a circus, the con
stant use of the whip Is necessary,
and the little pat on tbe neck the train
er gives the animal In-public Is not be
stowed in private. There is never any
let up In their training. ' ~ -
Trained dogs always appeal to worn-,
en aud children, for the little animals
appear to thoroughly enjoy their work.
But the barking and frisking are only
the natural joy of the poor beasts at
being let out of the cramped quarters
where they stay when they are not in
the | ring. Moreover, they know the
trainer, does not whip them in public.
There is scarcely a trick a trained dog
does that he likes or. that he will do at
order unless punished. Willis Cobb
was the first dog trainer to make a
reputation, and when be was middle
aged be abandoned his profession be
cause, be said, in- bad not tbe heart to
go on making a living by whipping
