cause he consrucion of school buildings eerywhere o be
criically examined wih he iew of remedying any defecs
from a fireescape sandpoin No doub he school rusees
of Collingwood hough |j hey had a yafe schoolhouse,
and neer dreamed of he possibiliy of such a errible calam
iy oeraking he children The building was proided wih
a fire escape, a poor affair s rue in he ligh of he whole
sale loss of life ,ha occurred, bu i was no doub deemed
adequae for any emergency Ye he scholars were caugh
like ras i a rap, he ery openings inended as means of
escape proing heir undoing, The faal blunder of he ar
chiec was ha he door of main exi opened inwards When
he children, franic wih frigh, sampeded for he door, hey
were piled up agains he doorway by hose pressing from be
hind, rendering fuile all effors o remoe he blockade
creaed by he crushed and sruggling humaniy
Probably many school buildings in eery sae in he
Union are no beer safeguarded in case of iire han was he
one in Ohio ha so recenly furnished his holocaus of
deah In he presence of his sad lesson, all schoolhouses
conaining more han one room should be proided eiher
wih swinging doors, or doors ha open ouward To reain
he oher syle of doorhanging is lile shor 'of criminal
The law of California requires school houses of more han
one sory o be proided wih fire escapes Concerning he
door openings s no so specific In mador couny he
wosory buildings a Jackson and Suer Creek are looked
upon as reasonably safe The wo Jacksou school
buildings are conneced by a bridge on he upper floor, and
he doors swing eiher way I Suer Creek he rear of he
sceond sory is wihin easy reach of he ground embankmen
lef in excaaing In some oher schoolhouses he proision
agains fire is less adequae, and he Ohio disaser should
moe rusees eerywhere o see ha no glaring defecs ha
made possible ha calamiy should be oleraed in he build
ings under heir conrol

he legal adiser of he couny will ake charge of any sui

If he reader will draw such a segmen

The Woman Who
Disappeared.
[Copyright, mo", by K. C Pafoell*.]
Wo wen? bottnd tip the coast to Val
<ll\lii ntid Rfltltlflgo nnil had run Into a
•torm that wrecked tiio brig aloft Wo
niiidc! shift, however, to work our way
Into one of the buy* oIT Cllllofl island.
Mill thcro we spent two weekn refit-
Un«. The Island named hi about forty
Blllca off the COflßl of (.'!:'>. It is flf
tee:i tntlea In Ichgili cihd from three to
ten mllea iv breadth, and at ITIO time
I Write of wnrt not permnneutly lnbab>
ited. n \a of volcnnlc formation, but
well tvodded.
Jiißt previous to leaving London on
this voynrjo Captain Bennet! bad boon
miurled to n youiif! lady whom ho had
been court Ing for over three years*
She was the daughter of n rnnntifac 1
tuicr, ntld the mairltigo had the con
bchi iimi good wishes of her family.
Sin was v liandsouie, Intelligent girl
of tvyottty, much In love with tho cap*
tnin. and this voyhge WHS their bridal
tour. I wn.B the i.'iii)l:iln's nephoW and
second mate of the brig.
When we had anchored the brig in a
landlocked bay and began nt the re
palra tho young wife suggested a tent
under the trees ashore. A tent was erect*
ed, a few necessaries taken ushoro, and
there the happy couple spent their
bights and part of the days. During
tho daytime, If the captain was not on
board, they wandered over the island
or gathered Bhells along the beach. If
he was on board wo could see her mov
ing about or sitting under tbo trees.
We dually had tilings ready to proceed,
and the tent and the wife were to bo
brought aboard next morning, when a
Strange thing happened. Captain I?en
uett had been with us all the after
noon, going ashore # about G o'clock In
the evening. An hour later wo wore
nodded that the wife was missing.
It did not seem a thing of much ac
count to mo when I went ashore at his
call. I myself had seen the woman as
late as l\ o'clock. She had been cau
tioned not to wander too far, but had
been a bit heedless. I had no doubt
that she would bo found within the
hour and that we should all have a
good laugh over the incident. The only
direction she could take from the "tent
was due west, where a narrow valley
led inland. The captain had gone a
mile In this direction and shouted her
name and got no reply. We now hur
ried along until we had covered dou
ble that distance, and we shouted at
the top of our voices, but no answer
came to our hails. We followed the
valley, winding and turning, for a dis
tance of two miles and then returned
to the beach for men and lanterns.
The disappearance was a strange
thing. The woman could not have lost
her way. She could have gone in only
one direction. She had only to turn in
her tracks to come back to the start
ing point. We had been there two
weeks and had not seen a stranger
about. Eight of us, provided with lan
terns or torches, divided into four par
ties and began a new search. One
party went up the beach, another down,
and Cue other two followed the valley
to its end. It began or ended in a
basin of about an acre In extent. This
basin was shut in by rooky hills and
pretty well covered with bushes. We
had brought a musket along, and for
an hour we shouted and fired by turns.
No reply did we get. Then we returned
to see what luck the others had met
with. There was not much to hope for.
The beaches were short, and no one
aboard the ship had seen the missing
woman strolling up or down. When
we reached the tent it was to find that
the other searches had been in vain.
Then the captain said:
"My wife has wandered to a dis
tance, nnd in climbing some hills, per
haps after a rare (lower, she has met
with a fall. She may bo lying dead, or
she may have been so badly hurt that
she cannot call out in answer. I shall
continue the search the night through."
There was no one who did not pity
the man. AYe had a crew of fourteen,
and, leaving only two men aboard as
an anchor watch, the rest of us re
newed the search. We went on the
idea that the woman must have climb
ed the hills at some point. Six of us
took one side of the valley and six the
other, and wo examined every spot
with the minutest care. Wherever it
seemed possible for a woman to have
climbed up we sent a man. We looked
for broken branches; we looked to see
if patches of moss had been disturbed;
we looked for fragments of her dress
clinging to briers. Not until daylight
came and we wera thoroughly exhaust
ed and discouraged was there any let
up. Then \vi> returned to the ship for
breakfast and a brief iost. The cap
tain sat down under a tree ashore.
When morning came again he had
made up his mind what to do. The
brig could no ' longer bo detained.
Stores sulllcient to last a man for many
weeks were landed, and she was sent
on her way in charge of the mate. At
Valdlviu be was to arrange for some
native craft to come and tako the cap
tain off. lie would remain and prose
cute the search until the mystery was
solved, and ho would allow no one to
remain with him.
It was three months later when the
captain was taken off. Hla ago was
only thirty, but ho looked like a man
of fifty. Ho was gray haired and l>ont
and wrinkled. lie had gone over evory
foot of the island twico and three
times over, and he had not found so
much as a shred of his wife's dress.
Not a bush nor a rock nor a gully had
escaped him. Not a thicket but .that
he had searched on hands and knees.
Not a foot of beach had been left un
watched for what tho tide might bring.
She had simply disappeared oft Chloe
Island, and to this daj no one knows
how.
