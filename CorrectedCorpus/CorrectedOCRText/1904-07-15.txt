THE ENOWMENTS OF YOUTH
[Original]
llan ouglas and ustin Brownell
were deoted college chums The in
timacy was inexplicable to others
What ouglas, with his splendid phys
ical and Intellectual endowments, could
find to bind him to Brownell, a reticent,
cynical man, without an element of
popularity in him, no one could dis
coer ouglas was the pet of the pet
ticoats and inited  eerywhere
Brownell was considered ery dull by
the fair sex and seldom inited any
where If he had been inited he
would not hae accepted Howeer,
there was one surprise concerning
Brownell Though he stood quite low
in his class, when he was graduated
one of his classmates, who was an
"honor" man, said that he wished he
had Brownell's mind
The friends studied law and prac
ticed in partnership They were still
young when the more showy endow
ments constitute prominence, and e
ery one, at least in society, wondered
how ouglas could hae taken up with
such an ordinary partner ouglas
was courted by the social world, eery
one striing to secure him for en
tertainments He tried to drag Brow
nell out with him, but failed both on
account of the disinclination of socie
ty for Brownell and Brownell's dis
inclination for society
ouglas married a belle She was* a
member of the smart set and a ery
smart member There was nothing she
would hae considered, more out of
place than attention in public from her
husband, and there was nothing she
considered more in place than to hae
some prominent society man dancing
attendance upon her Finally a cotillon
leader, Ernest Rackle, became so de
oted to her that the intimacy became
the town talk s usual in such cases,
no one talked of it to the husband
One night Brownell went Into a fash
ionable hotel restaurant where the
smart set were used to taking supper
after the opera ' He had neer been
there before and went for a purpose
Presently a gay party sailed in like a
fleet of yachts under a spanking breeze,
among them Rackle and Mrs ouglas
They passed directly, by the table at
which Brownell sat and as Rackle
passed Brownell put out his foot, and
Rackle tripped He didn't fall, but
came ery near it Turning, he glared
at the man who had tripped him, then
went on Brownell toyed with a wine
glass and waited Rackle as soon as
seated gae him a threatening and con
temptuous glance Brownell took a bit
•of paper from his pocket, wrote some
thing on it, folded it and gae it to a
waiter to take to Rackle Rackle
opened It, glanced at it and put it in
his est pocket without any of the par
ty haing noticed anything unusual
t 1 o'clock the two men met in the
cafe
"Well, sir,'' said Rackle, "what* do
you want?"
"To fight you"
"For tripping me up?"
"No; ostensibly for scowling at me;
really for a matter which' it concerns
you and a certain lady to keep dark"
"Who are you?" asked Rackle, ner
ously pulling his mustache
"llan ouglas' law partner"
"Indeed I am surprised that you
wish to bring trouble on him"
"I don't I wish to sae him from
trouble"
•'By a public altercation?"
"No; by a priate fight to the death"
There was something so calm in
Brownell's tone and eye, yet so deter
mined, that Rackle paled
"When and where?*
"Now, in an upper room of this ho
tel"
Rackle stood looking in different di
rections like a cornered rat seeking an
outlet
"What will obiate the necessity for
this meeting?"
"Your pledge neer to communicate
with Mrs ouglas again"
Rackle thought it oer, still pulling
his mustache Finally he saidPersonal
"To aoid bringing a lady's name
Into unpleasant notoriety I shall hae
to submit I promise"
"Write it"
 paper was drawn and signed,
which Brownell put in his pocketbook,
and the two separated
• In less than a week ouglas, came to
bis friend and announced that be must
dissole the partnership Mrs oug
las had taken an inconceiable dislike
to Brownell and had made the dissolu
tion a sine qua non Brownell pressed
his friend's hand ferently and assent
ed 
Two years passed ouglas' endow
ments had not gained him any promi
nence except in society, and, though he
did not know the cause, his wife's inti
macy with Rackle had detracted from
een this Certain prominent Jiidges
said that Brownell possessed the finest
legal mind at the bar, and if he had
ambition he might be the foremost
lawyer In the city This got spread
abroad, and there was n good deal of
curiosity with reference to Brownell
One day ouglas told his old friend
that Mrs ouglas had recoered from
her prejudice and wished him to come
to dinner Brownell accepted Then
Mrs ouglas went and sat by her
guest and whispered in his earPersonal
'!You were Just in time to sae me
I was a fool From this time las well
as llan will be deoted to you"
nother ten years hae passed The
attentions of Rackle to Mrs ouglas
are forgotten In society, and Mrs
ouglas js a model wife and mother
mong his friends ouglas is regarded
as prosy, but on Saturday nights he
gets a select few old fellows of igor
ous minds at his house, the central fig
ure of whom is Judge Brownell, and
in this way the host retains his repu
tation for an intellectual man

 CSE OF
CONSCIENCE
[Original)
"Jim," said the keeper, "I wish you
to promise me that you'll neer do
anything to make it necessary for me
to hurt you I'd rather put a bullet
into myself than into you"
"I'll try, BUI, to be satisfied to do my
time, but sometimes I feel that if I
don't get out o' here I'll go crazy"
"Be patient; you'e only got a year
and a half more, counting time off for
good behaior, and that'll soon pass"
, The conict turned away with a dis
satisfied exclamation; the keeper lock
ed him in his cell and returned to bis
office
Just three months from that time
Jim Burt, after a isit from his wife,
who smuggled him  a steel saw, cut
two bars out of his' window, let him
self down by means of his bedclothes,
dodged the guard and got away 'When
the escape was reported to the keeper
he heaed a sigh and, arming himself,
started in pursuit
"I must get Jim or kill him," he
said "Eerybody knows that he and
I were schoolmates, and eerybody
will beliee that I connied at bis es
cape"
There was more than this in Bill
Connolly's determination to capture or
shoot his old friend— a cast Iron con
science He considered it his duty to
safely keep eery prisoner, and If any
one of them escaped to get him, dead
or alie He could make no exception,
and in the case of his former friend he
must make a greater effort He diid
ed the pursuing force into sections,
sending them In different^ directions,
keeping one route for himself, a route
he felt sure Jim Burt would take Tom
Hathaway, who had been one of a trio
of friends when they were boys, Bill
Connolly and Jim Burt being the oth
ers, lied in a retired spot between
two mountains, a conenient place to
hide, and Bill knew that Tom would
hide their old friend Bill
One with a less sturdy conscience
would hae looked elsewhere for the
fugitie except, in the place where he
felt sure he was to be found, but Con
nolly could no more He to himself than
to those by whom he was paid to do
his duty He went alone to Hatha
way's, hoping that he might the better
preail upon Jim to return with him
oluntarily
It was a cold winter day when the
keeper approached Hathaway's place
Connolly shiered' at the thought of
Burt's being obliged to lie in conceal
ment in the cold
t Hathaway's he was told by Mrs
Hathajay (Hathaway was not at
home) that Burt had not been there
But he had, and she had gien him hei
husband's oercoat
Connolly knew of a cleft in the rocks
a short distance up the road and felt
sure he would find his man there He
walked till he came to an opening in
the bushes through which a path led to
the little coe, then took the path and
adanced When he came within a few
hundred yards of the hiding place a
oice calledPersonal
"Halt!"
"Come out, Jim"
"Neer alie, Billy"
"You know my duty"
"No, I don't, Billy I suppose you do"
"I'm obliged to take you back with
jne You know how it would griee me
to take you back in a box"
"Yes, I do, Billy? and you know how
it would griee me to shoot my old
friend You see, I'e got a position
here behind these rocks to do all the
damage, or rather you can't see, fop
I'm too well coered,"
"nd you'll kill me while I'm doing
only my duty, a duty that I can't fail
to perform without dishonor"
"I don't exactly see, it in that light
You hae your old friend's word that
he is not guilty of the crime for which
he is punished The master you sere,
the state, has made a mistake, What
you want to do is to make a big effort
to satisfy the public without really tryr
ing to do anything"
"That's not my way of doing a
thing I'm bound to do I'm not to *
dde on your guilt or innocence 
Jury has done that If they hit your
case wrong, that's your misfortune"
"nd if you are my Jailer trying to
take me and I kill you in self defense
that's your misfortune" ,
There was a long silence, at the end
of which Connolly said In a tone he
might hae used to a strangerPersonal
"Prisoner, come out and surrender or
I'll open fire on you'V
To which, after a short silence, Burt
repliedPersonal
♦'Keeper, I'll not take adantage of
a man who regards it bis duty to kill
me If I must fight yon, I'll fight you
in the open"
He sprang oer a rock and adanced,
Sring and receiing his antagonist's
fire as he adanced He had emptied
three chambers of his reoler and
Connolly had emptied, fie of his when
both fell some thirty feet apart and
lay without motion
Late that night Hathaway returned
to his home and learned that both his
pld friends had been there Burt had
told Mrs Hathaway where he was go
Ing and asked her to tell her husband
to come and consult upon some plan
for further action Hathaway hurried
away The moonlight lay on the white
enow as he left the road and struck
into the path that led to the rocks He
•walked rapidly till he came to the
bodies of Burt and Connolly lying side
by side He placed his hand first on
Blurt's then on Connolly's heart Burt's
was still; Connolly's was beating fee
bly The oercoat thnt Mrs Hnthaway
bad loaned Burt had been thrown oer
Connolly Burt, knowing that he had
receied hlB death wound, had crawled
to his friend and carefully coered
him

THE RB HORSE
Hell Virtually a Pony, but a Re
markably sturdy One
' The ' rab is irtually a pony, stand
ing 12 * hands, oftener under than
oer He is not fast, een at the gal
lop; indeed, he is slow ° He is a ery
poor trotter both as regards speed and
action, a bad hack, and cannot walk
without continually sticking his toe
in the ground He Is totally unfitted
for harness and la uncomfortable to
ride, except at the gallop; this is his
natural gait, and in It his moement is
free, smooth, delightful and easy s
regards his general makeup and an
atomical formation, he is perfect, and
his constitutional and physical sound
ness Is 'wonderful He has great bone
subetqgice, igor, resolution, strength,
staying powers, courage, boldness, so
briety,! the soundest legs and feet and
extraordinary lung power, which is
de"t»? the atmospheric conditions and
free life to which he has been used
from time immemorial; extraordinary
eyesight, good temper, mild manners,
tractabllity, instinct and sagacity, and
for his size is a wonderful weight car
rier '^%
It Is this constitution
and anatomical perfection, and this
magnificent courage, nere and mettle
of the rab which hae made the thor
oughbred of today what he is, and not
bis speed, which has only existed in
songs
The rab attaches far greater im
portance to bottom, speed and sobriety
than he does to what might be called
"artistic beauty" Of such a horse he
will sayPersonal "Let us not be in a hurry
Let us see him work He might be
only a cow, with a lion's hide on his
back" When you consider what then*
idea of bottom is, It may be sufficient
to know that It means a horse should
be able to trael with a man on his
back, a change of clothing, food for
rider and horse, his gun, flag, etc,
from sixty to ninety miles a day for
fie or six days in succession, and aft
er a couple of days' rest be able to
repeat the task, and this under a swel
tering sun Further, it is not uncom
mon for pure rab horses to coer
from 125 to 150 miles in the twenty
four hours, and this without food or
water until bis Journey is finished, and
then the rab, when be dismounts,

n Englishwoman of decidedly snob
bish Instincts, but socially intrenched
behind great and new riches, once en
gaged  the late Corney Grain to gie
an entertainment at her country house
She left instructions that 'the enter
tainer when he arried was to dine
with the serants The butler, j who
knew better, apologized, but Corney
was a man not easily disconcerted,
wrote Jerome K Jerome J He dined
well  and after dinner rose and ad
dressed the assembled company
"Well, now, my good friends," said
he, "if we hae all finished and if you
are all agreeable I shall be pleased to
present to you my little show"
The serants cheered The piano
was dispensed with, and Corney con
tried to amuse his audience ery well
for half an hour without It
t 10 o'clock came down a message
Would Mr Oorney Grain kindly come
up into the drawing room? Corney
went The company in the drawing
room were waiting, seated
"We are quite ready, Mr Grain," re
marked the hostess
"Ready for what?" demanded Cor
ney courteously
"For your entertainment," answered
the hostess
"But I'e gien it already," explained
Corney, "and my engagement was for
one performance only"
"Gien it! Where? When?"
"n hour ago— downstairs"
"Put this is nonsense!" exclaimed
the hostess
"It seemed to me somewhat extraor
dinary," Corney replied, "but it has al
ways been my priilege to dine with
the company I am asked to entertain
I took it you had arranged a little
treat for the serants"

BUYING RUB,ES IN BURM
 Peculiar Method of Bargaining For
th* Preclona Stones
The peculiar business methods of ori
ental merchants are illustrated by the
manner of buying rubles in Burma In
the examination of rubles artificial
light Is not used, the merchants hold
ing that full sunlight alone can bring
out the color and brilliancy of the
gems Sales must therefore take place
between 9 a m and 3 p m, and the
sky must be clear Personal"Personal ,V,V i'j
The purchaser, placed near a win
dow, has before him a large copper
plate The sellers come to him one by
one, and each empties upon this plate
his little bag of rubies • The purchaser
proceeds to arrange them for aluation
in a number of small heaps The first
diision is into three grades, accord
ing to size Bach of these groups is
again diided into three piles, accord
ing to color, and each of these piles in
turn is again diided into three groups,
according to shape The bright copper
plate has a curious use The sunlight
reflected from It through the stones
brings out with true rubies a color ef
fect different from that with red spi
nels and tourmalines, which are thus
easily separated •
The buyer and seller then go through
a ery peculiar method of bargaining
by signs, or, rather, grips, in perfect si
lence fter agreeing upon the fair
ness of the classification they Join their
right hands, coered with a handker
chief or the flap of a garment, and by
grips I and pressures mutually under

"Roses hae thorns" and "Walls hae
ears" are as common in the Japanese
speech as in our own We say "More
haste, less  speed," but the Japanese
phrase Is "If in a hurry go round"
In this country we ery often remark
that "accidents will happen in the best
regulated families" The Japs, on the
other hand, with an eye to the pictur
esque, italize It, so to speak, in their
"Een a monkey sometimes falls from
a tree" One of our useful English
sayings is "Those who play with edged
tools must expect to cut their fingers"
In expressing a similar thought the
Jap goes us one better so far as plc
turesqueness is concerned He says,
"If you keep tigers you are likely to
hae trouble" One of our standard
maxims is to the effect that "oil and
water won't mix" The Japs hae not
Improed on this' "You can't riet a
nail In a custard" is their way of put
ting it "The lotus springs from the
mud" is their poetical expression of
the common thought that "out of eil
good may come"
What could be more suggestie and
at the same time so poetic as their
"Scattering a fog with a fan?" • When
a Jap undertakes the impossible his
neighbors do not scoff at him or mock
him They Bimply say that he Is
"building bridges to the clouds" or
that he Is "dipping up the ocean with
a shell" Fnllure in such a country
must be as delightful as success In our

The stiffening of the tissues, which is

in eating and drinking and in lazy

EMOCRTIC CONVENTION
1 The emocratic National Conen
tion met in St Louis on July 6th,
and after a stormy session lasting
four da 3's aud nights adjourned after
haing nominated lton B Parker
for President and tPersonaliU S Senator
ais of Virginia for Vice Presi
dent' Judge Parker is said to be a
scholarly gentleman and a jurist of
marked ability Senator ais ser
ed with distinction in the upper
house of congress for seeral years,
and though 81 years of age he is
still actie both physically and men
tally and promises to enter into a
igorous campaign for the success
of the democratic ticket Up to the
time of his nomination Judge Par
ker had not spoken a single word
that would indicate his position up
on any uf the questions that were
considered of ital importance By
remaining silent he receied the
nomination on the first ballot But
in less than twentyfour hours there
after he assumed the role of dictator
and sent a telegram that threw the
conention into an uproar, the like
of which was neper before known in
apolitical gathering i the United
States The patch work that had
taken 1000 delegates through the
efforts of committees and subcom
mittees an entire night to put to
gether was torn asunder by a single
man in a moment's time Those
who looked upon him with distrust
now fear him all the more, while
those who had admired him for his
silence now find themseles trying
to explain away his first dictatorial
utterance The platform as adopted
by the conention is, to quote Mr
Bryan's sentiment, a meaningless
conglomeration of words, calculated
simply to catch otes, but it is so
utterly deoid of merit that it will
surely fail of its purpose We cite
the labor clause as an illustration
o not fail to read and study that
clause, my fellow workingrcen, and
if you can find any comfort in so do
ing you are certainly easily comfort
ed The only hope the democratic
masses now hae is for Parker and
ais to take matters into their own
bands and rewrite the whole thing
It is a slender thread to be grap
pling for, but it is always better to
sink while trying to swim, than to
fold one's arms in despair and say
"goodbye, all efforts would be in
ain, I die"
UNITE STTES SENTORSHIP
Bard and Oxnard are doing con
siderable talking just now down in
the southern part of the state as to
which should be elected United
States senator from California It
is the old story of one man tryiog to
hold on to a good job and another
trying to get him to let go Bard
has plenty of money, so has Oxnard,
and if both remain in the fight we
may expect liely times next fall
We remember that two men once
made a stubborn fight for the same
office One was' named Grant, the
other Burns, and after each had
spent a fortune along came the third
man and "Bard" them both out
This is a big state and there will be
plenty of opportunity for, these men
to state specifically; the one why he
should be returned, the other why
he should be selected Then if the
people are not satisfied with either
we understand that Geo  Knight
is willing to take the position at the
same salary, and there are but few
republicans in California who would
not feel proud to hae  Geo "
Kuight in the senate He is a man
of ability, an orator of national re
pute, and a man big enough to repre
sent the whole state, as a senator
should do California to hae in
fluence must send her brainy men
to the national congress She has
lately been honored with a cabinet
position and a commissionership,
and if our best men are sent to

for that purpose /
But there will bo more than that
There will be present a man of national
reputation as an expert judge of lie

Bureau of nimal Industry of Wiscon
sin, who has judged the stock for the
past two years, and who possesses the
faculty of making losers acquiesce
cheerfully in his decisions He not
only judges the stock, but he compares
them point to point, explaining their
merits and deficiencies so clearly, and
in language so easily understood, that
the farmer can learn as readily as the
breeder and can easily perceie which
breed will best suit his purpose for the
use for which he desires to raise it,
whether for beef, butter or cheese, or
for a family cow Ho will also learn
how to pick out the indiidual of that
breed that is best suited to his needs
Certainly such Information alone will
well repay him for his time and ex

False Report
 It was currently reported last week
that  S Hartwick, the fisherman ac
cused of selling' trout in Sutter Creek,
had plead guilty and paid a fine of $20
This is a mistake Hartwick has not
plead guilty, has paid no fine, and does
not propose to unless the court so de
crees Justice Rose claims that if he
has no jurisdiction to try the case he
has no authority to fine the accused
$20, but can only conduct a preliminary
examination and hold him to appear
before the superior court or discharge
him for lack of eidence Thus the

Political Gossip
 Bryan is spoken of as a hasbeen,
Hearst as a wouldliketohaeJbeen,
Parker as it, and aid B Hill as a
willbe if Parker is elected
Hearst says Parker" cannot carry
New York
Bryan said Parker could not pos
sibly be elected
"pplause for Parker 20 mrj^fof
Bryan 32 m; for Hearst 38 m"—Ex
aminer • You can always depend on
the small boy or paid rooter "Willie"
if you can't on delegates
Hearst got 200 otes Will any one
make an estimate of the cost per ote?
elmas made a brilliant speech, but
the Examiner says Hearst got all the
applause
Parker was silent before the" con
ention and receied the nomination
He has spoken once since and came
near losing it He will now be muzzled
until aftcr thr election
The mador ispatch succeeded in
defeating Hearst It made a gallant
fight and won »
Hearst pays Rooseelt a glowing
tribute for his settlement of the 'coal
strike Hearst is now free to speak
the truth
Let the Labor Union men road Hob
son's speech and see what democracy
has done for them PersonaltPersonal t 
Turn Parker and Hobson loose with
out telling them what to say and Roose
elt need ask for no better campaigners
The democrats at last hae an issue
"explaining that Parker telegram "
Read the arious explanations
Bryan was taken with acute bron
chial affectations at the St Louis con
ention He will probably grow worse
until after No iPersonalPersonal her
Bourke Cochran left the St Louis
conention feeling confident that defeat
stared them in the face He has now
telegraphed to Parker sayiog "Me
too'!
Since the nomination of Parker the
populists hope to elect Tom Watson
president
The "Slier Tragedy" is ended;
Parker has said so, Hearst is willing
and Bryan has acquiesced Cleeland
says he will now ote the democratic
ticket
Rooseelt and Fairbanks are talking
pleasantly at Oyster Bay  while eery
democratic orator and newspaper of
note are apologizing for Parker's first
great blunder
Farmers in the great alleys are
complaining  of the scarcity of help
Was that the cry under democratic
rule? ;
The democrats now hae Rooseelt
and Fairbanks  quarreling Nothing
but another democratic telegram that
may require an apology later on
Richmond P Hobson misquoted
Booker T Washington and the color
ed gentleman has called the hero down
Chance now for an apologetic telegram,
Richmond
Hearst has offered Parker the In
fluence of his great papers With their
influence Hearst receied 200 otes,
while'without their assistance Parker
receied nearly 700 otes If Parker
is a mathematician he will probably re
ject the offer
Bryan, in a round about way says,
I, as a politician, must ote the ticket,

 TRIP TO THE
WORL'S FIR
California at the Big Exposition
St Louis, July 6— Eery Californian
must feel proud of his state because of
the magnificent display of California
products at the St Louis fair In the
agriculture and horticulture buildings
she leads by a wide margin all other
states This is frankly conceded by
isitors generally That which strikes
the stranger most forcibly is not merely
the size of the products shown, but
their ariety It amazes the aerage
farmer to see that one state not only
grows so many products, but also excels
in nearly all of them Struck with the
size of peaches and other fruit, the re
mark is frequently heard, "Oh,  they
are magnified by the glass jars" They
are unmindful of the fact that if this
explanation is applicable to the Cali
fornia exhibits, it will hold good with
respect to other states So really it
explains uothing, ami the golden state
remains at the top of the list "Cali
fornia will surely get the prize for the
best display," is beard on eery hand
Certainly those to whoso care was con
fided the getting up and arrangement
of this exhibit are entitled to great
credit They hae done their work
admirably True, they had the ma
terial to work with Still, een with
the best material the effect might be
lost with inartistic display Our man
agers, howeer, hae paid due regard
to this point; the arrangement being
as artistic and effectie to correspond
with the superior character and diers
ity of the products
mador county, I regret to say, does
not figure in the display I looked to
find her name mentioned in connection
with the exhibits in the three build
ings, namely, griculture, Horticul
ture, Forestry, Game and Fish, but in
ain This is not the only, way in
which she has been ignored Her
name, her territory een, does not
figure upon the maps and literature
placed in the buildings for free distri
bution The promotion committee for
the deelopment of the Sacramento
alley hae folders and maps, and hae
done good work for the section em
braced in the combine mador, not
withstanding that lone alley will com
pare in fertility and ariety of products
with the best lands of the Sacramento
alley, has no part therein The map
stops short, with our neighbor to the
north, El orado
\ Passing on to the department of
Mines and Metallurgy, we looked for
an 'equally creditable display for the
state at large, and something to "show
that mador was strictly in the pro
cession We must confess, howeer,
to a feeling akin to disappointment
California occupies a large space — fully
as large as any other state, and much
larger than the majority of sister states
That the showing is large and aried
and fine cannot be denied, still to a
resident of a mining section it falls
short of expectation, and especially so
from the iew point of mador county
Neada county makes a splendid dis
play of gold specimens in two large
show cases This is really the feature
of tho exhibit There is an apparent
lack of care — a sloenliness we might
say — in the section as a whole that im
presses the beholder The'tastiness
manifested in some of the other sec
tions—Colorado for instance— is want
ing Samples of crude ore are not ar
ranged to the best adantage Many
of the samples are not een labeled in
any way Many labels hae been torn
off, the marks where the labels were
affixed showing plainly No effort has
been made to restore the labels In
some instances the labels are hidden
away among the specimens so as to be
unreadable; in other cases they are
turned wrong side up, aud allowed to
remain so Indeed, the air of indiffer
ence and neglect was too palpable to
pass unnoticed by the most cursory ob
serer, at least at the time of our isit
Most of the display was eidently taken
from the State Mining Bureau exhibits
mador county is not utterly ignored
in the mining display We looked par
ticularly to this point The number
and importance of our mines, and the
alue of gold output entitled us to loom
up to adantage in a showdown of
mineral products Besides which, if
we are not mistaken the county was
canassed for weeks in the interests of
the State Mining Bureau, for the ex
press purpose of collecting samples of
ore for exhibition There is nothing
here to show for this labor fter
carefully passing oer the section twice
we noticed one specimen from the Con
tral Eureka, one from the Oneida, and
one from the Tellurium mine, Volcano
This is the sum total of the gold ores
Besides these, three samples of copper
ore from the Copper Hill mine on
Cosumnes rier, presented by W F
etert and erroneously credited to W
F eterle were noticed This com
prises the whole of mador's contribu
tion to the mineral collection from
California There may hae been
other samples, but if so they are
among the unnamed, and therefore
might just as well hae been kept at
home s a county we made no effort
to bo represented, which practically
means that we did not want to be rep
resented We secured the non recog
nition that wo bid for, and while the
outcome is galling to our local pride we
hae no ground for complaint
We hae spent oer two weeks here,
and hae done little more than skip
hurriedly oer the acres upon acres of
exhibits Of foreign nations Japan
shows up wonderfully well, taking up
a large space in nearly eery building,
and her display in eery branch com
mands marked attention On the
other hand, Russia has totally defaulted
so far In one or two buildings a space
marked "Russia" is noticeable It is
also noticeable that it is either deoid
of exhibits, or surrounded by a cloth
fence to indicate that it is not open to
the public
We start for home ia New Orleans
tomorrow, and hope to reach Jackson
in one week R W

Shot His Friend
Marico Marietta shot and perhaps
mortally wounded James aetchi, as
he lay asleep in his room at the Roma
Hotel at the corner of 2nd and J street
in Sacramento The crime is consider
ed one of the most cold blooded in the
history of the city The men former
ly resided in Jackson and had long
been friends Marietts supposed to
hae become jealous of aetchi, be
cause he saw his wife in conersation
with aetchi Marietti tried to es

NOTES FROM
GOL MINES
Kennedy— The addition to the mill
is being completed as rapidly as pos
sible When the 100 stamps are run
ning this will be one of the most
thoroughly equipped plants in the
state • 
Oneida— Eery one is working and
saying little at this mine, which is a
good indication that the mine is in a
flourishing condition Superintendent
Hampton keeps a watchful eye on
eerything and is familiar with the
most minute details of eery depart
South Eureka— Fifty men are
now employed at the mine Good ore
is belngfmined, and the milt is again
running to its fullest capacity The
future of this property promises to be
much brighter than its past
Central, Eureka— When a' prop
erty pays as this one has done, and is
doing, you can expect nothing but
praise for the mine from superintend
ent, stockholders, directors, and em
ployes This is the sentiment that
preails throughout at the Central
Contentment and satisfaction are the
watch words and eery thing moes
with the regularity of clockwork , 
Lincoln— Wildman— Mahoney—
The Bpirlt of actiity still perades the
surrounding atmosphere, and those
in charge assure the anxious ones that
extensie operations  will j begin about
ugust Ist The water is now being
taken out of the Lincoln shaft The
whistle blows regularly
Keystone,— The old reliable Key
stone neer relaxes for a moment, the
mine is full of men both day and night
and the mill neer fails to yield a good
ly portion of the yellow metal that
caused the democratic conention to
drop the siler plank from their plat
form
Bunker Hill— This, is one of the
busy spots In little mador and  those
in charge hae great faith in the future
deelopments of the mine
FremontGoer— The mine has
now been closed three months Eery
Industry in j the county has suffered
thereby $600,000 hae been 'inested
by the present owners and the prop
erty is still a prospect Work will un
doubtedly begin soon
rgonaut— The large ore bin is
piled high with good looking rock
eelopments are proing satisfactory
in the mine, and when the mill starts
again it will probably run continuously
for years
Zeila— Repair work is now in order
and the working force has been reduc
ed to 0 men Many of the discharged
miners are spending their acation in

Falls Sown Shaft
Mokelumne Hill, July 10— John
Souden, a shift inspector at the Gwin
mine, yesterday afternoon fell from the
skip to the bottom of the shaft, a dis
tance of 2000 feet, and was killed His
body was mangled beyond recognition
Souden and a fellow Inspector, Chris
Curoich, were going up the skip in
specting the shaft, a daily custom, pre
paratory to lowering the 3 o'clock shift
of miners Within fifty feet of the top
Curoich, who was examining his side
of the shaft, heard his partner gie a
warning signal, "Lookout" Turning
around he saw Souden's body being
drawn between the skip and the wall
plate 
The body 'was crushed through a
space of six inches and fell below be
fore a signal could be gien to stop
The supposition is that Souden, seeing
something was wrong, thrust his head
out to examine more closely and his
head was caught between the wall' and
the skip The miners below knew
nothing of the accident until they heard
the body plunge into the sump Se
eral hours passed before the head and
all the members were recoered
Souden was 37 years old and leaes
a widow and child He had been work
ing for the company eight years and
was a trusted and highly respected em
ploye—Examiner
Mr Souden was well known along
the mother lode in mador county
He lied for many years in mador
City, where he married the daughter
of Mr and Mrs J H Thomas His
remains were interred in the mador
cemetery on Monday, under the auspices
of the Union, Workmen, and Foresters
of merica He leaes a wife, ; daugh

Bryan's Influence
WmTJrBryanwent into the demo
cratic national con entioiTand with a
firm step and a clear conscience handed
back to the democratic party the com
mission it had placed in his hands eight
years before He gracefully acknow
ledged his inability to win in the two
preious campaigns, but took particular
pains to remind the conention that ha
had receied a greater number of the
popular otes than any democrat who
eer aspired to the presidency  He
spoke in a manner that carried with it
the impression that no other democrat
could or would receie a greater num
ber of otes at the coming election He
was sincere in eery word he spoke, in
eery gesture he made, In eery im
pression that he wished to coney ' It
must hae been a thrilling moment
when this master democratic mind pre
dicted by action, if not by word the
fruitlessness of the effort that they
were about to make in the coming
fight Many who were present on that
occasion will recall, after the first
throes of defeat, the scene as it pre
sented itself to them on that day, and
hail William Jennings Bryan as the
grandest man of the democratic party
What other man in the ranks could
hae gone before the platform com
mittee singlehanded and hae adopted
by a large majority a plank that was
slated by the knowing ones to be killed?
What other man could hae stood be
fore that committee Personal and fought the
gold plank to a standstill?  We answer
none '  Bryan himself was slated by
many to be litter ally, stripped of his
political influence, but by his superior
ability and persuasie  eloquence •he
won the respect and  admiration ' of '
eery person who gained  admission to
the great conention hall He stands
out today in striking contrast to those
who sought to do him injury He is
the greatest democrat of them all, and
the day Is not far distant when he Personal will
again be heralded as such ' s

Strike at the Jumper
' On July 2 the management at the
Jumper Gold Syndicate's properties in
Tuolumne county posted notices that
commencing July 5 all underground
workmen would be required to strip to
the naked body before passing through

shift; also that on and after that date
men working underground would be
notified by light signals when to leae
off work and when to resume at lunch
time, making tharegulations in regard
to lunch time the same underground as
on top
The first of these notices aroused a
strong feeling of resentment among the
150 employees of tfie company, result
ing In the calling of a special meeting
of Tuolumne Union, No 73, W F of
M, on Sunday, July 3, 190, when
action was taken, whereby, in case the
obnoxious order was not withdrawn,
after representations against it were

The Way a Thirty Foot Monster
Came to lie Captured
 One of the most interesting objects
in the Natural History museum in
Trondhjem, Norway, is a large octo
pus E R Kennedy, the author of
"Thirty Seasons In Scandinaia," not
only saw the octopus, but a lyprie later
heard the story of the capture of it, as
related both by the fisherman whose
boat it attacked and also by two in
dependent witnesses The fisherman
was ' leisurely rowing on a calm day
close to the rock bound shore of one of
the fiords situated some fifty miles
north of Trondhjem Suddenly a lous
and glistening arm swept oer the
stern of the boat and remained there
The fisherman, astonished at this un
wonted apparition, dropped his oars
and sprang to his feet Like magle
another hideous looking arm shot oer
the gunwale The boat canted The
man, realizing that he was attacked
by some monster against which his
old fish knife was the only aailable
weapon, seized his oars and labored
with might and main to get his boat
Into a creice of the rocks, all the time
yelling for his mates, who were not
far off He had to strain eery nere
to drag his hideous cargo after him,
for the suckers neer relaxed When,
half exhausted, he got the bow of his
craft within reach of willing hands, it
took the three men to haul it up a
slight Incline, for the monster still
bung on, een oer the bare rocks
Then they belabored its head with
oars and clubs Haing safely secur
ed it, they 6ent off to the nearest sta
tion and telegraphed concerning their
prize It was at once purchased by
the museum and carried there after it
had been photographed They stretch
ed its arms out before preparing it
The longest were each fie alen or ten
feet four inches, in length Oer all,
together with the great carpet bag
body; the monster measured thirty
feet across

MnKlcal Effects of tbe Sapphire
To the sapphire has been ascribed
the following magical propertiesPersonal That
it preents wicked thoughts; that it is
such an enemy to poison that if put in
a glass with a spider or enomous rep
tile it will kill it St Jerome in his
exposition of the nineteenth chapter of
Isaiah says thairthe sapphire procures
faor with princes, pacifies • enemies,
frees from enchantment and obtains
release from captiity This gem was
sacred to pollo and was worn when
inquiring of the oracle at his shrine
It was esteemed as a remedy against

Sleepinar In a Cannon
The Interior of a cannon is perhaps
tbe last place in the world one would
associate with a siesta, and yet India
possesses a gun which is capacious
enough to form a chamber where of
ficers retire for a siesta during tbe
heat of the day This cannon, which
is beyond question the largest in the
world, is probably also one of the old
est It was cast nearly 00 years ago
by a famous chief of hmednugger,
and came into English possession

 PLUCKY LIEUTENNT
He Was Insubordinate, but He Saed
His Vessel
Reuben Finkbatn, a natie of Nan
tucket, made his first trip as third lieu
tenant on the ship I'otomac, which
crossed the north raciflc, a region
little known to naal essels in the
early thirties Pinkham had been on
seeral whaling oyages, and was fa
miliar with those waters The author
of "The Island of Nantucket" says
that one day, near sunset, he had the
watch, while the commodore was pac
ing up and down the deck '
Suddenly Pinkham gae the order,
"Man the weather braces!"
"What's that for?" asked the com
modore  ' ,
"We shall hae wind in a moment"
The commodore went to the lee rail
and scanned the sea and sky "I see
no signs of wind," he returned "Let
the men leae the braces"
The crew dropped the ropes
"Keep hold of the braces, eery man
of you!" called out Pinkham, and the
men 'resumed their grasp The com
modore flushed with anger and ex
claimed in peremptory tonesPersonal
"Let the men leae the braces!" and
again the braces were dropped
"on't any of you dare to drop the
ropes!" shouted Piukham, shaking his
trumpet at the crew, who once more
took hold Just then the wind dropped
entirely; not a breath stirred
"Taut, taut! Haul, all of you!" called
Pinkham, and the ponderous yards
swung to reersed position The wind
came out of the opposite quarter and
struck the ship like a sledge hammer
The essel staggered, shook the spray
from her bows and dashed ahead Tbe
commodore disappeared into his cabin
without saying a word
 Presently he sent the first lieutenant
to reliee Pinkham, requesting to see
the latter immediately When Pink
ham entered the cabin the commodore
saidPersonal ;Personal>"
"I consider that I am indebted to you
for all of our lies; but I will tell you
frankly if that wind hadn't come I
should hae put you In irons in two

The Koreans loe medicine The
rich take pills of incredible size and
richly gildedPersonal
There are no bankruptcy courts in
Korea Once a Korean contracts a
debt he can neer escape from it
Korea is the only country where the
marriage certificate is equally diided,
one half being gien to the husband,
the other to the wife
Eery Korean husband is answera
ble for the conduct of his wife Should
she break any of the ordinary laws he
must suffer in her stead
The most important duty of eery
housewife in Korea is to keep alight a
perpetual fire, which Is eacred to the
dead ancestors of the household
No Korean may go upon the roof of
his house, not een to repair a leak,
without legal permission and without
giing due notice to all his neighbors'
Paper enters largely into the con
struction of eery Korean house The
Interior is lined with paper It has a

The Number Ten
In arithmetic eerything goes by
tens Sociologists trace the human lik
ing for that number to the "pentadigi

characteristic feature of the entire

plump for the decimal system for just
the reasons that impel human beings
Een a horse, which now has only one
finger and toe on each foot, has hints
in his anatomy which show that his
ancestors had the pentadigitate_ ar
rangement Biologists are much Inter
ested to consider how the number
eoled was fie Why not four fin
gers or six or more? Somehow, more
than fie would appear to be rather
more than one brain could gie inde

more useful than four

He Was a Prophet
In Cheshire, England, there are leg
ends of a prophet, one Robert Nixon,
who is supposed to ; hae lied in the
days of King James I Personal His fame
spread, and the king sent for him, ac
cording to the story Nixon was great
ly distressed He wept and mourned,
saying that If he went to London be
should be stared When he arried at
court the king, haing hidden a ring,
asked him to find it Nixon replied,
"He who hldeth can find" This great
ly struck the monarch, who ordered
him to be kept in the kitchen so that
there might be no fear of his being
stared Nixon bad a great appetite
he could manage a leg of mutton at a
sitting— and he became such a nuisance
that one day the cooks locked him in a
closet Here he was forgotten," and
his prophecy came true— he was stared
to death The closet is shown in Hamp
ton Court; but, unfortunately for the
eracity of the tale, that portion of the
building was not built till the reign of
King William 111
To Sae One's Bacon
Some think that the phrase "to sae
one's bacon" arose at the time of the
ciil wars in  England, when house
wies in the country had to take ex
traordinary precautions to sae bacon,
their principal proision, from ' the
greedy appetite of soldiers
In a slang sense bacon stands for the
human body, and "to sae one's ba
con" is just to escape, so that when it
Is said that a man has saed his bacon
It refers to himself,' as do the cogiiate
expressions, "Spare my bacon" | and
"Sell one's bacon" Thus in Carlyle's
"Schiller" we read, "To the kaiser I
Bold my bacon, and by him good
charge of the whole is taken" 1
Others hae less probably connected
the phrase with the times when heresy
was expiated at the stake, and a man
was said to hae "saed his bacon"
who had narrowly escaped being burn
ed alie
The French hae a ery similar
phrase, "Sauer son lard"
Hoit Sparks re Formed
Sparks are formed by the expansion,
under the action of heat, of air con
tained in the minute cells of wood, coal
or other burning  substance and nlso
by the eolution of gas in the same
cells When the elastic force of the
imprisoned gas or air is greater than
the tenacity of the material can hold
in check, then the small cells or caii
ties burst, and the flying splinters rise
as sparks  sharp crack commonly
accompanies the explosion and con
tinues as hundreds of these cells burst
in rapid succession The quick flight
of these burning particles acts as a
fan to Increase the flame, and when
the substance burns so far that no
more flame is formed the remaining
carbon ash is kept in a state, of In
candescence by the draft of air When
all the carbon has been consumed tbe
spark dies out, as is eident if we
watch a falling spark on a dark night

OUR SENSITIVE EES
THE PECULIR MECHNISM OF THESE
WONERFUL ORGNS
How They re ffected by the Shock
of the ischarge of Bis GnmTUe
Odd Way In Which Some Earu re
Played Upon by Various Sound*
Wheneer a big gun is fired at Fort
Hancock, the goernment's proing
grounds on Sandy Hook, the officers In
charge adise all spectators to stand
on their tiptoes, suck their fingers in
their ears and open their mouths On
board ship, where conditions are such
that one cannot get far away from a
thirteen inch rifle, the more sensitie
among the officers and sailors place a
cork or chunk of rubber between their
teeth when there is about to be a dis
charge ; Men hae been known to
bleed in the ear from the effects of the
concussion caused by a much smaller
gun than a thirteen inch bore One
of the officers at Fort Hancock was
asked to explain the philosophy of ele
ating oneself on the toes, placing fin
gers in ears and opening the mouth, ;
"Standing on the toes is like stand
ing on a spring," he replied, "while
standing on the heel or full sole of
the foot is like standing on a solid By
placing a spring, between your person
and a iolent force the Impact is so
weakened that you are unlikely to suf
fer injury In the firing of heay ord
nance a seere shock may be receied
from the ground
"s for the fingers in the ears, that's
plain enough It is simply closing the
auditory canal to preent the ingress
of the air which is set in intense i
bration by the discharge Many a
careless soldier has had his tympanic
membrane destroyed by neglecting to
close up his ears, either with his fin
gers or some foreign substance
' /'lt is wise to open the mouth, for the
reason that to do so tends to equalize
the pressure caused by the detonation
With the mouth closed the pressure is
on tbe external side of the tympanic
membrane, forcing it inward and split
ting it When the mouth is open this
is offset by the same pressure from
within, by means of the eustachlan
tube
"Many men in the artillery are mi
nus tympanic membranes, but that
wonderful design of nature is not ab
solutely necessary to bearing When
it is torn the hearing is impaired, cer
tainly, but not destroyed, since the
surrounding air then acts directly upon
the membranes of the two orifices
Nothing In anatomy is more beautiful
than the arrangement of the ear I
hae made a study of It since coming
here, as I had the misfortune to lose
one of my tympanic membranes
"The inner membrane of the cochlea
is lined with elastic fibers, discoered
by Cortl and bearing his name They
apparently form the terminations of
the filaments of the auditory nere
Helmholtz, the greatest authority on
acoustics the world has produced, de
clared that each one of these fibers Is
attuned to a special note, and as they
are aboe 3,000 in number there must
be oer 00 for each octae The in
teral from one to another is oncsixty
slxth of a tone They form a won
drous instrument for reproducing eery
note that the ear can distinguish The
cochlea may be called an seollan harp
of 8,000 strings that moe In sympathy
to all the sounds of creation
"Many ears are Incapable of hearing
ery high sounds Many persons are
deaf to the chirping of crickets, , and
some cannot hear the twittering of
sparrows ' There was said to be a
boy In Texas whose ears were de
formed to a remarkable • degree, the
auricle of one being nearly as large
as the side of his head, while that of
the other was no bigger than your
thumb nail By closing the small ear
he could hear the approach of a rain
storm a hundred miles off By closing
the big one he could hear a fly walking
on the ceiling Isn't that romantic
enough for you? It takes a iid im
agination to beliee the story, but
when you consider the miracles of the
ear and hearing you may beliee al
most anything
"I do not doubt that there are many
sounds so faint that our ears are deaf
to them, but they make sweet music
for others You know what paracousis
is, I suppose No? Well, you hae it
when you caijnot hear faint sounds at
all when thinfs are still, but hear them
at once when they are accompanied by,
a great noise I once read of a woman
(an authentic case) who made her ser
ant beat a drum wheneer she want
ed to listen to anything, for then she
coufd hear ery well There was a
man who could not hear except when
the bells were ringing It is an old
story that deaf persons hear well when
traeling on a railroad, or when rat
tling oer a rough highway in a car
riage
"There was a shoemaker's apprentice
who heard only when his master was
beating out a sole on his iron Tbe
left ear generally hears better than the
right Some say this is owing to tbe
common habit of sleeping on tbe right
side I hae my doubts There is a
record of a man whose two ears heard
different tones at the same time when
a single one was gien
"The ears of the lower animals are
Incomplete o fishes hear? Certain
ly, although the caity of the tympa
num is entirely wanting, the round and
oal orifices being at the top of the
head Look out! Get up on your toes
and open your mouth The mortar on
the left is about to be discharged The
wind Is with the shell, so you needn't
close your ear There she goesl" — New
