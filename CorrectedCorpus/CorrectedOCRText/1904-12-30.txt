"So thuj/s the way the land lies, is
it?' asked Iy Lyle h  ' V
The sensitie face under the big, rose
tned sun hat was ery white Her
tfps quiered a little The hands that
beld the agrant sheet trembled
"It isn't that I care!" she told her
self "I hadn't begun to care — in that
way I was only becoming — attracted
But the shock— the disillusion"—
When she had started out an hour
ugo for her usual brisk morning walk
along, the crisp, sheling j sands, she
had been one of the most indifferent,
light hearted of girls She was done
with college] and the two years of for
eign trael had succeeded school as a
sort of polishing process She had per
fect health and misty dreams of all
the eiled future held in its keeping
She had aesthetic tastes, and her skill
In athletic sports was the admiration
of her less igorous girl friends She
had been haing a beautiful time down
at this gay, uucoueutioual resort on
tho Michigan const nd now — well,
temporarily it seemed that her pleas
ure was spoiled
nd in her heart she knew that she
must hae been beginning to think too
much of the man whose attentions to
her had been so marked or else this
discoery would not so affect her Sit
ting to rest and watch the white crest
ed waes come curling up to break on
the border of the lake like threads of
rarest lace, her attention had been
caught by a small, white, whirling ob
ject that at first sight she had taken
for a bird It had whisked lower and
nearer Then it floated so close she
could put out her hand and grasp it,
and she found it was a sheet of note
paper coered with diminutie chirog
raphy It was written on the station
ery of the fashionable hotel looming
up on the dunes behind her t first
she had been about to crumple it up
and cast it aside, but in the ery act
of doing so a name — her own name —
met her eye
Een then she hesitated But the
three words were so significant she
must know their writer's full mean
ing The page was the continuation
of a letter, and the first three words
at the top of the page were "loe
Iy Lyle!" Impulsiely, giing her
self no chance to weigh the niceties of
honor in the balance, she scanned the
page s she read it slowly again the
fresh, soft color went tiding qu{; of
her cheek
"Loe Iy Lyle I'e fought against
it, for I can't afford to marry her, as
you know But she has rather swept
me off my feet, old chap t first I
was taken with her innocent beauty,
There was no one at this big hostelry
to compare with her for looks So I
let myself drift I thought she was
just a dear little country girl and that
it would be eaSy to say a sentimental
farewell when ilie summer was oer
You know what these warm weather
flirtations amount to So I'e been go
ing to see her steadily and taking her
eerywhere We'e gone dancing and
swimming and boating and all the rest
of it, and, by Joe, for all she's
piighty quiet, I'e come to find bu'f
she's hot 'the typical little country girl
at all She's well read and traeled,
though she seemed rather aghast when
she let that fact out nd she looks at
a fellow in a cool, apprising sort of
way that makes him feel pretty cheap
if his spoken thoughts are not quite up
to her white standard But she's not
really in the social swim She's a na
tie, I take it It's been hard to pin
her down to any confidence about her
self Sli£ lies with a ery dragon of
an aunt at a farmhouse on the edge of
town She wears her cotton dresses
and shade hats in a way that takes
the shine out of the women up at the
hotel, but I'e neer seen her sport
any of the swell clothes they wear to
the hops here Oh, confound it, what's
ih'e use of my mooning away to you
at this' rate? I'e got to go away and
try to forget her before it's too late
pamarls Chase and her father are
to be here this week, they tell me
nd she's the girl the heads of both
our houses expect me to marry She
may hae the good taste to refuse me,
and I almost hope she will She's a
great heiress, and the consolidation of
the business Interests would be a cap
ital thing; but, oh, hang me if I thought
it would be so hard to get that little
girl's sweet face out of my heart I
must do the sensible thing and go In
for the $20,000 a year Lord, but I'm
sorry for those poor deils of kings
who hae to wed for reasons of state
I feel disgustingly like one of them
I'm sleepy Good night I'll finish
this in the morning Ten to one I
dream of Iy Lylp',"
It needed no signature The writer
was easily recognized She crumpled
the paper tightly in her hand and
thrust it into the blouse of her gown
as a rapid, heay step came crunching
flown the beach That step had be
come too pleasantly familiar Could
he hae known the sheet had been
whisked out of his room? Had he
seen it blown down to the beach?
"Good morning, Miss Lyle!" He
flung himself down beside her His
handsome, boyish face looked strained
and set, as though Insomnia had
claimed iilm "You're out early Will
you go rowing with me today up to
Clear Springs?"
"I— l can'tl" she faltered
The pleading oice had become so
perilously dear to her she found it
hard to refuse Something strange In

her tone made him look up quickly,
and he saw how pale she was
"You "are ill?" he cried sharply
"What is It? What Is wrong?" 
There was no doubt of the sincere
concern in' his eyes
"It is nothing!" Pride came to her
aid She rose "I must go home"
"nd won't you come up Black rier
today?" entreatlngly, almost tenderly
"It may be the last time!"
He was planning— planning  Oh,
that cruel, cruel letter! But— the last
time, he had said
; She flung up her head and smiled at
him "Yes, I will go!" she said
They were ery gay that afternoon,
almost recklessly so They had lunch
eon at the inn near the springs and
floated back between the wooded banks
Just as the day was closing When'
they came to parting at the clump of
lilac bushes in the lane that led to the
farmhouse Jack rdsley leaned for
ward and looked into her eyes
"ear,'', he said, "I loe you! I loe
you, find I can't let you go out of my
life— eer! You don't know much of
me, Iy, but— will you be my wife?"
"What," she faltered, "what about
amarls Chase?" '
He took her shaking hands and held
them fast
"Who in the world has been telling
you of her? I'e neer seen her, but
our fathers hae ast interests in com
mon and hae been anxious to arrange
a match I don't say I didn't think of
being complaisant arling, some time
I may get up courage to tell you how
near I came to being a paltry coward,
how desperately I tried to make myself
think I could do without you But 1
cannot, and that's all there is to It If
you can endure being poor with me for
a few years I'll work so hard at my
profession to gie you eerything that
I shall be sure to win" ';\' '
She bad not been mistaken in letting
herself loe him, then! For she did
loe him— she did nd she had known
it all the while She lifted her shy,
flushed face
"I will be a good wife to you, dear!"
she promised nd he kissed her on
the lips

That night when he sought her at
the dance at the inn he stood amazed
That loely lady in the snowy, shim
mering gown his demure little coun
try lassie! How superbly she carried
herself! nd those diamonds around
her white throat were worth a fortune
She smiled up at' his amazed counte
nance V;; ' 'Personal
"unt gatha and I did not wish to
be bothered with attentions," she whis
pered, "so we'e been liing incognito
I expected my father tonight and
dressed to do him and you," sweetly,
"what honor I could You will pardon
me," as she signed for a boy who had
brought her a telegram and broke the
seal of the message "etained!" she
read "Will be with you tomorrow!"
She handed rdsley the yellow slip
It was signed, "Jasper E Chase," and
It was addressed to "Miss amaris

"That," she said, "is my name!"
"Iy!" he gasped,  ' "

Tricks of ncient Gold Workers
There is a papyrus which gies
recipes for arious alloys used in the
manufacture of cups and ases, for
making gold and siler ink, for gilding
and silering and for testing the purity
of precious metals Other recipes
teach the method of falsifying them
by adding baser metals— an operation
palled dlplosls, or doubling, for the
mass of the gold and siler was dou
bled, while their, color remained un
changed, and, as the compiler of the
manual remarks, a skilled workman
would find it difficult or een Impos
sible to detect the fraud The recipes
which recur most frequently describe,
arious modes qf preparing asem,' a
word which originally meant a naturaj
pljoy of gold and siler known to the
Greeks as electrum It was at first
looked upon as a distinct metal, was
considered sacred to Jupiter and was
designated by the sign of that planet,
but at a later period the name was ap
plied to all alloys, and in this fact
seems to 11? the explanation of the
origin of alchemy Both gold and
siler could be extracted from genuine
asem, and it seemed as though it could
be changed at the will of the operator
into' either one or the other It could
also be made artificially by mingling
gold and siler, or closely imitated by
some of the numerous alloys, eleen or
twele arieties of which are describ
ed in the papyrus of Leyden |

The'professional hobo generally tra

hnppcns to meet other congenial mem
bers of his profession a pooling of in
terests is sometimes undertaken, a ho
bo camp set up, and the town is sys
tematically worked  The spot or a
camp usually chosen is in the outskirts
on some wooded tract not too far from
the railroad Here the profits are di
ided and the different territories al
lotted; t nightfall all congregate to
this point with the spoils and supplies,
and oer the "hobo stew^ incidents of

FRUIT MYSTERIES
The Baaoot Is Seedless, Though No
body Knows Why
The banana is seedless, or nearly so,
and has been for centuries, though
nobody knows why It is propagated
by suckers and possibly had no seeds
when it was first found in its wild
state The banana is a modified berry
Cutting the fruit through the middle
you will sometimes see a few little
brown spots, which are the rudimen
tary seeds Occasionally the banana
does actually produce a few seeds
The pineapple is seedless, being prop
agated likewise from suckers and from
slips The eggplant, which is a fruit,
botanically speaking, is occasionally
seedless ' This plant Is able to pro
duce deeloped fruit whether the blos
som Is fertilized or not Horticultur
ists are endeaoring at the same time
to rid fruit plants of thorns Some
oranges and lemons are ery thorny —
for example, the high priced King
orange, which is the best of the man
darins The first trees were brought
to the United States from Cochin Chi
na In Florida its thorniness has been
reduced by selecting buds from the
branches with the fewest thorns
Thorns are objectionable because they
puncture the oranges and lemons
when the branches are blown about
by the wind Efforts are being made
to get rid of the thorns on raspberry
nnd blackberry plants simply for con
enience In picking the fruit The
thorns are meant by nature to protect
the plant from animals Cultiators
select those plants which happen to
be thornless or nearly so
Laugh

Gorgeous Japanese Robes
In number the diaphanous robes
worn by a Japanese woman of high
rank of the eleenth or twelfth cen
tury were seldom less than twenty,
while on great occasions een more
might be necessary Thus at a great
palace fete it is said that "some wore
as many as twentyfie suits, showing
glimpses of purple," of crimson, of grass
green, of wild rose yellow and of sapan
wood brown, their sleees and skirts
decorated with golden designs, while
others, by subtle commingling of wil
low sprays and cherry blossoms and
by embroidered patterns picked out
with gems, represented the poem of
the jewels and the flowers"

Consumption
•I There is no specific for
consumption Fresh air, ex
ercise, nourishing food and
Scott's Emulsion will come
pretty near curing it, if there
is anything to build on Mil'
lions of people throughout the
world are liing and in good
health on one lung
From time immemorial the
doctors prescribed cod lier
oil for consumption Of
course the patient could not
take it in its old form, hence
it did ery little good They
can take
SCOTT'S
EMULSION
and tolerate it for a long
time There is no oil, not
excepting butter, so easily
digested and absorbed by the
system as cod lier oil in the
form of Scott's Emulsion,
and that is the reason it is so

n necdote Which Illustrates His
isagreeable isposition
Carlyle suffered from dyspepsia and
disappointment' He was therefore nei
ther oersympathetic In intercourse
with his friends nor fair In his esti
mates of other writers
Though he personally liked Tenny
son, he spoke with Impatience of his
"cobbling his odes," dismissed Jane
usten's noels as "dish washings,"
Hallam, the historian, as "dry as dust"
and Goldsmith as an "Irish black
guard"
Een the writers ot editorials In the
press were saluted with this hard say

They tlnly sere to cancel one anoth

oked him to inflict pain een on a
friend
 n artist who frequented Carlyle's
house painted a picture of him in bis
dressing gown smoking a pipe by the
fireside and Mrs Carlyle In an arm
chair sitting opposite him The pic
ture was hung at one of the Royal
academy's exhibitions and, though not
a striking work of art, was purchased
by Lord  shburton, Carlyle's friend,
forfoOO , •'' V ;
The delighted artist hurried off to
the Carlyles, expecting congratulations
on the sale and some manifestation of
pleasure on their part at haing such
a alue set on a picture of themseles
and their domestic interior He deli

sponse he' receied from Carlyle wasPersonal
"Well, In my opinion, £500 was just
£05 too much,"
When to Exercise
When to exercise is an important
consideration If the morning only Is
aailable the exercise should be light
Particularly is this the case if one is
engaged In any work The supply of
energy must not be drawn from at the
beginning of the day The afternoon
is perhaps the best time for exercise,
when one has gained strength from
the absorption of the morning and
poon meals Those who exercise igor
ously at 'night should eat a midday
dinner Exercise should always pre
cede bathing and not, as a rule, follow
It In this respect the ancient Greeks
showed great wisdom Exercise and
bathing they called the two pillars of
strength Exercise was Hercules and
bathing pollo Both were regarded
with equal importance, and neither
was complete without the other'

Tim's father, who in the boy's ab

"What for?"
" 'Cause I couldn't find Moscow on
the map"
"Couldn't find Moscow? nd I'd
like to know who could, then! Why,
I remember hearing tell of Moscow be
ing burned when I was a boy! It's an
outrage to put such nonsensical ques
tions to children what's there to learn

It  la eep ' and Lasting, but, as a
Rule, Not Outspoken
Public demonstration of affection is
most repugnant to the good taste of

this which is so generally mistaken
for a lack of genuine feeling I recali
one man who was so deoted to his
mother (though I doubt whether be
could  eer hae been said to hae
"talked about" her) that when she died,
while he was abroad, his depression
was so profound that my husband
watched him with anxiety lest bo
should commit suicide The stoical
training may  render \ more unsympa
thetic a coarse nature, but repression
to the refined soul brings an exquisite
capacity for, pain scarcely conceiable
by those who are free to gie utter
ance to eery emotion
nother man said  to • me, "I rarely
speak of my mother, for a foreigner
does not understand that a Japanese
mother may be just as dear to her son
as his to him and by the Japanese It
is not expected that one should utter
one's deepest feeling" That same
son fainted with grief when his moth
er  died and when j consciousness Personal re
turned rose to make  light ' of a "little
dizziness," without reference to its
cause ' To this day, wheneer he goes
from home, he carries with | him his
mother's letters, mounted on a beauti
ful roll of Iory and brocade, and on
the anniersary of her passing beyond
his mortal ken quietly deotes a por

THE JPNESERUSSIN WR
The war between Japan and Russia
may be a long way from flnal settle
ment It has emphasized one thing
—namely, that a new worldpower
in tbe orient must hereafter be rec
koned within the treatment of ques
tions dealing with matters in the
Far East Until ery recent his
tory Japan — with her undersized
people — has been deemed of no con
sequence from a military and naal
standpoint llied to the Mongolian
hordes of " China, whose military
prowess has been demonstrated to
cut little figure, in spite of oer
shadowing numbers, the Japanese
hae been classed on the same low
estimate as regards patriotism and
military alor with their neighbors
of the main land t the outset of
the present war, the consensus of
opinion held the Japanese goern
ment — notwithstanding the admit
tedly just grounds for complaint
against the encroachments of the
Northern Bear — to be reckless in
 deed to attempt to measure swords
with Russia In numbers, in finan
cial resources, and in military pres
tige, the dwarfish islanders were
looked upon as hopelessly outclassed,
and destined to fall an easy prey
both on land and sea before the war
riors of the Czar, Russia has paraded
before the world for generations as
an unconquered and unconquerable
nation Her mission is to extend
the map of Russia until it embraces
the whole or the better portions of
both Europe and sia Unceasingly
she has pushed her frontiers in eery
direction with that end in iew The
menace of Japan by the insidious
occupation' of Manchuria, and the
adance upon the Korean peninsula,
was deliberately taken in accordance
with this welldefined policy What
temerity for Japan singlehanded to
call a halt on this strutting and self
proclaimed boss of the world It
was like a pigmy talking fight to a
giant The war has been in progress
for nearly a year, and although still
undecided, it has proed a reela
tion on both sides It has shown
Russia as an oergrown effete
bully — big merely in territory and
numbers, but wofully lacking in
' naal and military preparation On
the other hand Japan has fully es
tablished her claim to naal and
military supremacy Russia's nay
in the far east — at the opening of the
war supposed to be the strongest in
that part of the world — has been
utterly destroyed One lone cruiser
 remains in fighting trim The Baltic
_^<fieet in two squadrons is in route to
the seat of war for the purpose of re
storing Russia's naal prestige, and
there is hardly a doubt that it will
meet with disastrous defeat at the
hands of Toga and Kamimura On
land the Japs hae been equally suc
cessful They hae drien the Rus
sians hundreds of miles into the
interior of Manchuria Excepting
Port rthur, the Russians do not
hold any disputed sea coast terri
tory on the Pacific That strong
hold — doubtless the strongest eer
subjected to the test of modern im
plements of war — is practically in
the hands of the brown 'warriors of
Japan Its surrender is simply a
question of time When that eent
takes place the humiliation of Russia
will be complete Her cup of bitter
ness will be full to oerflowing — a
righteous outcome of the game of
duplicity and braggadocio she has
played among the nations for hun
dreds of years
But what will be the effect upon
Japan? Will she bear the honors of
war becomingly, or will she too be
come puffed up with her newfound
importance? Will the nations of the
east doff the war paint, under the
stimulus of the successes of the
island kingdom? In placing a eto
upon the inroads of the Sla peril,
has Japan conjured up another and
perhaps greater eil— the yellow
peril? Will the outcome of this
struggle between the Occident and
the orieut work for the weal or woe
UNION SCHOOL LW
The agitation in the northern por
tion of the county for the consolida
tion of a number of school districts
into one strong union school, with
Plymouth as its center, seems to us
a step in the right direction The
last state legislature passed a law
proiding that a number of school
districts may unite to form a union
grammar school, proiding for the
transportation of pupils liing at a
distance to and from school at the
expense of the school funds The
people are extremely sensitie on
educational  matters n opinion
preails that we hae reached the
pinnacle of efficiency in our proision
for the education of the rising gen
eration; that our system is incapable
of improement, except in the direc
tion of proiding more money to be
spent for more schools, or larger sal
aries for the teachers The idea of
retrenchment is tabooed/ as a moe
of a retrogade character While
no one is prepared to adocate a
niggardly policy in educational
facilities, still there are many who
beliee that better results ought to
be attained from the ast expendi
tures of money now demanded annu
ally to support the common schools
of the state We hae aimed to
place a school house almost at the
door of eery family haing children
of school age In thinly settled dis
tricts it is ineitable to hae small
ungraded schools But the policy
of multiplication of school houses
has been pressed in the icinity of
the centers of population, and" many
think to the injury of the cause, of
education It is a common occur
rence to find a teacher employed to
instruct a school with less than an
aerage daily attendance of ten
scholars These pupils are of all
ages, between six and sixteen, and
consequently there is little scope for
the working of that spirit of emula
tion between children of the same
age In a graded school a teacher
is better able to take charge of a
class of thirty or forty pupils, than
a class of ten in an ungraded school
In a number of eastern and middle
west states the system of consoli
dating a number of weak rural
schools into one strong central
school has been tried, and the re
sults hae proed so satisfactory
from eery iew point that the cen
tralization plan is rapidly extending
Instead of taking the school to the
outlying farm houses, the plan of
coneying the children from the
farms to the school and back to their
homes is the policy now proposed
round Plymouth, for instance,
there are fie or six small ungraded
schools within a radius of four or
fie miles It is a struggle to main
tain an eight months' school By
the union plan these schools may be
consolidated, the rural schools sur
rendering their organization and
•uniting with the central school at
Plymouth, thereby forming a school
of oer 00 pupils Contracts might
be entered into for the coneyance of
pupils liing in the remote parts of
the district to and from the school
 number of contracts for coney
ance would be necessary to accom
modate the children liing in differ
ent directions The cost of coney
ance would be more than offset by
the  reduction in the number of
teachers employed and the expense
of maintaining so many school build
ings Experience has demonstrated
that the plan is eminently "satis
factory from both an economical and
educational standpoint The out
come in the Plymouth district will
be watched with much interest in
other sections of mador county,
where the consolidation plan is con
sidered both practicable aud de
sirable
PROPOSE TX ON SWEET WINES
The commissioner of internal re
enue recommends that a tax be
placed upon brandy used in the
fortification of sweet wines The
tax is intended to proide a reenue
of at least one million dollars annu
ally from this source It is reported
that the rate suggested is fie cents
per gallon of the wine product
Eery section of California will be
hard hit if such a proposition is' em
bodied in the law California is by
all odds the heaiest wine producing
state in the union Oer one half the
total product of the United States is
supplied from California The indus
try has grown to be a ery important
one In mador county the wine
grape industry has struggled along,
and at the present time has reached
a profitable basis, and is" steadily
growing The proposed tax will
seriously cripple, if not absolutely
ruin it We hae receied from the
secretary of California Viticultural
Club copies of a memorial to our
representaties in congress, urging
them to do their utmost to defeat
the proposed tax The wine growers
are urged to hold meetings in their
respectie localities, and adopt reso
lutions in opposition to this measure
s congress adjourns in March, there
is no time to lose Copies of the
memorial may be had at the Ledger
office, and all the wine growers hae
to do is to hold a meeting and ap
point a president and secretary to
sign the protest Let the wine men
act promptly, and do what they can
to aert a crushing blow to a ery
promising industry in this county

City Pharmacy, Jackson
Residents of cities of more than
25,000 population lie at least three
and onehalf years longer than those
in the country This fact has been
disclosed by the experts at the cen
sus bureau It is not, as might be
inferred, the arising on cold winter
mornings to build fires and milk ten
head of cows that; kill country peo
ple They naturally lie longer in
the cities than I in the country
wellers in large cities take all sorts
of chances of being killed by trolly
cars, but the census office experts
hae figured out that few meet death
that way The median age of the
country's population, was 1597 years
one hundred years ago; in 1900 it
had increased to 2285 years The
increase is at the rate of about two
thirds of a year each decade Nearly
onefourih of the population of the
United States are less than 10 years
old, and more than threeseenths
less than 20 years old Less than
oneseenth hae lied fifty years,
and only twentythree out fit eery
1,000 persons hae lied the allotted
seenty years Children less than
one year old contribute 25 per cent
of the aggregate population, while
children under 5 years constitute
122 per cent The percentage of
children under one year old in the
population aries from one to thirty
in Utah, to one' to sixty in Cali
fornia There are fewer children in
New England and on the Pacific
coast than anywhere else in the
United States " Threefifths of the
merican population are in what is
known as the "productie age"
group, whose ages  are between 15
and 60 years The goernment has
firmly established the fact that
women "fib" about their ages This
tendency is strongest in negroes and
foreign born" women, but nearly all
insist on underestimating their age

One of the Highwaymen Captured
Sheriff Norman on Saturday eening
brought from San Francisco Vincent
Paleti, one of luo throe nPersonaln wasi'lei! for
the holdup of Vincenzo Moropito, near
the east shaft of the Kennedy mine on
ecember 2 It will be remembered
that Moropito came to Jackson a few
days before the robbery, bringing with
him an Italian named Mateo Valasso,
whom he had met in Sacramento, with
the other two concerned in tho robbery
Moropito was known to hae inouey,
as ho was seen to draw the $200 from
the bank, and the conspiracy was con
cocted by the trio to capture this
treasure Vatasso came on as the ad
ance agent in the scheme, and the
other two followed the day before the
robbery occurred Oh the 2d of e
cember the four set out from Jackson
on the plea of looking for work in the
mines bout dusk Moropita was en
ticed to a suitable spot between the
Kennedy and Onelda, and there re
lieed of all his money, amounting, to
$180 and a nickel watch They gener
ously left him 20 cents and bound his
hands and feet and left him on the trail,
to be cut loose by the first passenger
The three men' haing accomplished
their purpose made their escape They
were seen at seeral places, at Martell's
station and in the neighborhood of
Mount Echo They separated soon
after the crime, the short man Vatasso
taking one direction,  and his con
federates, Paletl and Cabaelo, another
Paleti was run down in a peculiar
manner It seems he and Casaelo
made their way to San Francisco, by
way of Stockton, and arried at the
bay about ecember 7, fie days after
the holdup They secured lodgings
on Pacific street In the meantime de
scriptie circulars had been sent out
broadcast from the sheriff's office in
Jackson, describing the three men and
offeringa reward of $25 for theircapture
Last week the authorities arrested a
man in San Francisco on a charge of
carrying a concealed weapon Paleli
was with him, and the officers took
him into custody on suspicion of being
concerned in the murder of policeman
G W Brown of Oakland He gae
his name as Paleti, and this caused the
officers to look up the circular sent out
by Sheriff Norman, only to find that
the description, as well as the name,
tallied with the prisoner
The sheriff started for the city Fri
day morning, taking with him one who
had known Paleti here, and who was
able to identify him He at once recog
nized the captie as one of the men
wanted Paleti was thereupon turned
oer to Sheriff Norman, who brought
him to Jackson and landed him in jail
Saturday night — just in time to greet
Santa Claus from a prison cell,
Paletl had only 30 centsleftf t when ar
rested He had togged himself out in
Stockton with a new suit of clothes,
new bat, etc  new alise was also
In his possession, and in this was found
the old clothes he had on when the
robbery was committed
On Sunday Paleti' was confronted
with his ictim, Moropito, in the county
jail The latter at once Identified the
prisoner as one pf the robbers, and in
excited tones accused him of taking his
money Paleti denied that he had eer
seen him before; that seemed the only
defense loft for him  ' "
It is belieed that Casaelo Is still
around San Francisco, and strong
hopes are entertained of landing him
with his pal Paleti before long

IVIING THE TIPS
The Method That Is Followed In
Sonic London Restaurants
, Tipping has been reduced to a ery
line system in some English hotels and
restaurants "I was sitting at meat
with the manager of one of the well
known Landon restaurants," says a
writer "'1 am short sighted and un
obserant,' I said, 'and as I neer
know one waiter from another I'm al
ways uneasy lest I'e tipped the wrong
one' The manager laughed 'Fritz,
bring the book,' he said The book
was opened upon the table and dis
closed columns and rows of figures op
posite the nuines of waiters Between
them the manager and Fritz explained
the system
"Eery penny gien in tips was cast
into a common fund ln charge of a
waiter elected by his fellows t the
end of the week the sum was distrib
uted Three classes were arranged by
the manager, according to efficiency,
and the shares were ln corresponding
proportions, so that the junior who
hoers with the sauce is by no means
equally rewarded with the expert who
can adise in the matter of wine
"Waiters keep a jealous eye on their
fellows, and the man suspected of
pocketing a tip finds his position un
tenable The system Is good for the
public, since It diminishes the unpleas
ing personality of a charitable action
It Is good, too, for the waiters, since
that record of the weekly gratuities
showed that the best waiters made
about $2,000 a year ln tips"

of the shortest and easiest of toilet
duties It is swallowed in a second,
and in fie minutes it has passed from
tho stomach, taking with it the clog

tracts It has left behind tbe stimulus
that goes with cold water, and, by fill

puts a spur to the circulation that has
grown sluggish in the night— Chicago

THE BRIE'S PORTION
t One Time It Was Stated In the
Wedding nnouncement
It was a common custom ln the
eighteenth century, especially during
the reign of George 11, to insert no
tices of marriage stating the bride's
portion In contemporary periodicals
and newspapers both in England and
Scotland
lmost eery number of the Gentle
man's Magazine at that time contain
ed seeral of these records, of which
the following, In 1731, is a specimenPersonal
"Married, the Red Mr Roger Walua,
of York, about twentysix year of age,
to a Lincolnshire lady, upwards of
eighty, with whom he is to hae fB,
000 in money, £300 per annum, and a
coach and four, during life only"
Sometimes the notice merely de
scribes the bride as a lady with a
"good portfcm" or a "genteel fortune"
One of the latest notices was in rts'
Birmingham Gazette, July 1, 1800,
which recorded the marriage of Mr
Canning, undersecretary of state, to
Miss Scott, "with £100,000 fortune"—

Butterflies and Moths
Though butterflies and moths are
found widely distributed all oer the
globe they are by far most abundant
ln the tropics For instance, Brazil can
show to the collector not less than 700
different species within an hour's walk
of Para There are not half as many
in all Europe In Britain there are 67
species, and ln all Europe there are 390
different kinds They are found as far
north as Spitsbergen, on the lps to a
height of 9,000 feet and on the ndes
up to 18,000 feet s there are some
200,000 species It Is easy to see why
butterfly hunters are great traelers

NTIONL ELECTION Y
Why It's the Tuesday fter the First
Monday In Noember
Why should the law prescribe "the
Tuesday next after  the first Monday
in Noember" ; instead of saying "the
first Tuesday ?"j Like many other small
things this proision introduces an in
teresting picture of the past
lthough the constitution requires
the electors in all the states to meet
and choose a president , on the same
day, it was not until 185 that a law
was passed by congress proiding that
the electors should be chosen on  the
same day throughout the United
States When William Henry Harrison
was the Whig candidate, in 180, New
York began to ote on the first Monday
in Noember, and the polls were kept
open until Wednesday night Election
day in Massachusetts was the second
Monday, but before that day, in this
instance, enough states had oted to de
cide the contest The National Intelli
gencer of that year records that seeral
thousand aged and infirm Whigs in
Massachusetts did not bother to go to
the polls
elaware oted a day later ' than
Massachusetts Illinois, Indiana and
Pennsylania were among Personal the  early
oting states labama was one of the
last This diersity, corniced with
slow methods of transmitting news,
left • the election results in doubt for
many days
' The system was not satisfactory, The
states that oted early had an undue
influence on the result Especially was
this true as communication became
more rapid, and by 180 an enthusiastic
editor told how the news from Pitts
burg had been brought to New York ln
thirtyfie hours "This," he added
significantly, "is a sign of the times"
Congress accordingly decided to es
tablish a uniform day The original
bill named the first Tuesday ln No
ember, but it was found necessary to
harmonize this with the requirement
that not more than thirty days should
elapse before the 'meeting' of the elect
oral colleges ln the different states,
which had been, set for the first
Wednesday in ecember When Tues
day is the first day of Noember, e
cember will hae no Wednesday till
the seenth The Interal is thirty
seen days Under the law as it was
passed in 185 not more than twenty
nine days can elapse between election
day "and the first Wednesday, in e
cember Under the law of 1887 the
electors do not meet to gie their otes
until the second Monday in January—
