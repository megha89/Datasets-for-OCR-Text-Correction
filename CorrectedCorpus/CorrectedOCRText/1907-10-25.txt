Brooks had come o Cenerille for a

Then Bess had gone o Europe as

as she reurned Curis Brooks had been
called o Souh merica on a maer of
grea imporance They had corre
sponded wih such regulariy as heir
uncerainy of ' moemen permied,

The frown was sill on Brooks' face
when he wen down o breakfas
Langdon's jolliy irriaed him, and
when hey wen back o he parlor
afer he meal he was gloomy and
dispiried Een Bess could no win
him ou of himself, and finally he wen

announced
Wriing consised in siing before a

Bess sood in he hall, smiling as
hough here was no such hing as

"on' you wan o go up and hae
a look a he Big rock his r'ernoon?
she asked "I hink i's going o sop
raining a las nyway, I can wrap
up well I would be a shame no o
see he old place before you go back"
"Bess, you're an angel," was all ho
could say She laughed a he remark
M l would be more seasonal le o call

She dared away, and Brooks, wih
a new hope in his hear, caugh up a
pen and wroe he leers ha he had
been rying o compose all he week
Bess was promp, and a  o'clock
hey me on he piazza The rain had
gone back o a ligh drizzle, bu Lang
don affeced o ake a las farewell of

Boss gae him a saucy reply, and
hey sared down he road I was a
hard climb up he seep side of he
mounain a he foo of which Cener
ille nesled, bu afer he suffy a
mosphere of he house he we earh
filled he clean air wih a fragrance
peculiarly Is own
Bess drank deep drafs down ino
her lungs "I'm glad ha we came,"
she declared "I isn' so ery we,
and I did wan o hae you see Big
rock again"
"I was afraid ha I would be wasb
d away before we could ge up here,"
he said, wih a smile "This has been
a nighmare week, Bess Wha can
you hink of he way I'e been acing?"
"I don' blame you," she said sofly
"I mus be horrid o hae your only
week spoiled Bu here is Big rock,"
she added as hey came In" iew of a
huge bowlder, relic of some glacial pe
riod
 In clear weaher hey could see far
down  he " alley from  he ledge on
which he rock sood Een now hey
were gien a glimpse of green fields
and he darker in of he wooded sec

rier had become a leaden reflecion of
he cloudy skies
Brooks leaned agains he rock, while
Bess seaed heaself upon a smaller
sone Personal  For a momen neiher spoke;
hen Brooks urned o her
"I was my one wish o come np
here,'! he said "o you remember las
summer meeing me here?" /
 "s hough i were yeserday," she
answered "I had been lay dreaming
In he shade of he rock, and you came
crashing hrough he bushes I was a
lile frighened, I remember"
"I waned o come back here," he
said refleciely "I had a foolish no
ion ha r should be more forunae If
I spoke In he shadow of he Big rock
I waned o ask you o marry me, Bess,
bu I don' suppose you would dare
marry a chap who had shown such a
emper as I hae In he' pas few
days"
"Why don' you ask and find ou?",
she suggesed demurely ' •';/»
In a momen he was upon his knees
beside her He had gien up all hope
as he long we days wore upon his pa
ience He had, no supposed ha she
would rus her fuure o him Now

o all else For a quarer of an hour
he gae heed o nohing sae he swee
face before  him, looked a J nohing
sae he; ender eyes, now so full , of
loe ' Then she genly, disengaged her
self and poined across he alley
Far In he wes he sun was showing
hrough a rif in he clouds, lighing
wih prismaic splendor he arch of a
rainbow "Life Is like ha, dear," she
said f genly "There mus  be some
sormy days ha we may beer ap

"nd you are no afraid— een of my

"Of course no, you foolish, boy"
"Bess, ' he said impeuously, "I'm go

I know how hideously unpleasan hey
ore ll his week I'e been growing
