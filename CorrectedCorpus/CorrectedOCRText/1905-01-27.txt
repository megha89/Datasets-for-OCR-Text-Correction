The fable of the country mouse and

fact Slice occasionally migrate in
large numbers when food grows scarce
and trael considerable distances to

Perthshire had a good reason to be
come aware of this fact when a couple
of years ago ast swarms of mice in
aded their cornfields at harest time
But the mouse ouly traels when It
has to The rat, on the contrary, seems
to take a yearly outing in ery much
the same fashion as do human beings
Rats are the most migratory creatures
In the world Whole troops of rats
leae the towns at the end of summer
and spend a nionth or two In the coun
try, apparently in order to enjoy the
change of food, which the county af
fords at thnt time of the year in the
way of fresh fruit and grain Before
the cold weather sets in they are all
back in their old quarters
Reindeer migrate with the same regu
larity as swallows They moe south
when winter sets in, but as soon as
eer the snow begins to melt they
trael steadily north, sometimes for as
much as a thousand miles
To end a holiday by deliberate sui
cide Is so strange a phenomenon that
for a long time naturalists looked upon
the stories of the migration of the lem
mings as an Improbable fiction Yet
the facts are beyond dispute t ir
regular interals these ratlike crea
tures start out from their homes In the
fastnesses of northern Scandinaia in

THE LOST PRISE
tHEORIES S TO THE LOCTION OF
THE GREN OF EEN
The Conienaui of Learned Opinion
Supports the Belief That dam and
Ee'H Original Home Wai on tha
Great Babyrbnian Plain
lmost eery spot of the globe hag
had the claim made on its, behalf that
It Is the site of anished Eden Most
persons seem agreed on the fact that
paradise has disappeared from our
midst The question is, Where was It
situated? To those who deny the Bib
lical story of man's genesis the ques
tion takes another form, and they per
plex themseles as to the spot in which
man first appeared on this earth
Some eade the  difficulty by saying
that man appeared in many different
spots— that he did not spring from
one original
If we accept the doctrine of the ar
winians we are forced to confess that
the place where man first eoled must
hae been anything but a garden of
Eden It must hae been a haunt of
mere animalism, and its food would
certainly not hae been fruit Rough
ly speaking, therefore, there are two
schools— those who beliee that man
came from a diine original, but fell
away from his first estate, to which
with infinite labor he may return, and
those who'beliee that he eoled from
the beast and is still eoling to the
greatness that he may ultimately at
tain Setting aside these somewhat
discordant theories, we may well ask
Where was Eden?
The soundest scientists j are  agreed
that mankind came from awingle ori
gin — whether a distinct creation or an
eolution is beside the mark— and the
original man must hae had a local
habitation The geographical manuals
and maps of the middle ages leae a
good deal to be desired In the matter of
accurate detail, but they hae at least
the merit of boldness, "and If we go to
them for an answer to our question we
may get something like a definite re
ply ccording to an old map of the
thirteenth century, paradise Is a cir
cular Island lying near India It is
surrounded by a wall in which is a
gateway opening to the west The
gate is closed and the wall quite In
surmountable Our later atlases do
not locate this happy island
Other early maps would hae us be
liee that Eden lay In central China
We can go with these ancient geog
raphers so far as to place the probable
site of man's blrthrJtace In sia, but
the consensus of learned opinion does
not incline either to India or China
Eminent authority supports the idea
that Eden lay somewhere on the great
Babylonian plain, watered by the Tigris
and the Euphrates— the Peratb and
Hiddekel of Genesis Other authorities
gie their ote for rmenia, possibly
Influenced by the tradition which says
that the rk rested on Mount rarat,
but this tradition would ouly point to
rmenia as the probable first home of
postdiluian man
Professor elitzsch and Professor
Sayce faor Babylon; Heidegger faors
Palestine; Media, rabia and the up
per Nile hae all then supporters Qua
trefages, treating the subject j solely
from a scientific standpoint, concludes
that linguistic and other human types
point to central sia, but' does not de
cide on any precise locality 
With the author of Genesis, as r
Knllsch has remarked, "Eden is geo
graphically described in a manner
which leaes no doubt that distinct lo
cality was before the mind of the au
thor" Een to those who think that
this author was building on uncertain
traditions it must yet be of interest to
know what this locality was Babylon
was the most fertile land known to the
ancient world; Its poorest fields repaid
cultiation flftyfold, Its better a hun
dredfold Its luxuriance of fruit and
grain was so great as t be actually
embarrassing There Is no question at
all that this district was the seat of
sia's earliest ciilization and there
fore why not say of the world's?
The idea of man created perfect and
liing in a garden of fruitful loeliness
has always had a fascination for poor
humanity, recognizing its present Im
perfections and the frequent distress
Ing dlsmalncss of Its present surround
ings Een those who knew nothing of
the Bible story pictured such a spot for
themseles Eery early, mythology
has its fortunate Isles, Its tlantis, Its
Hesperides, its rcadia and its Golden
ge •;;PersonalPersonal
Some persons een conjectured that
paradise had not been on the earth at
all, but was nn island floating hi tht
ujr, something like the island isited
by Gullier They did not wish to
think that the sacred spot could be
submerged by the waters of the del
uge, and by this deice tlrfsy raised It
aboe any such calamity On this is
land dwelt the sacred phenix; the
well of life flowed there, the elixir of
Immortality; leaes neer fell from the
trees; the sun shone always on a per
petual summer Men declined to be
liee that Eden had been destroyed
foreer They preferred to Imagine
that its gates were closed to them for
a season To deem that such a spot
could anish seemed sacrilegious
Many an early oyager and explorer
had strange dreams of discoering
some earthly paradise when he set out
for unknown shores— dreams perhaps
not spoken, but secretly nourished and
strengthened by unconquerable forco
Of romantic superstition that lied In

Through the stained glass aboe the
palms and roses the midday sun
streamed In, flecking the scene with
gorgeous j reds, blues and greens It
shed a golden glory upon the tall, slen
der, graceful bride, and at the sight
the best man shut his jaw a bit more
determinedly She was looking more
than eer like an angel, and in fie
minutes she would be the wife of his
best friend That was the monotonous
sentence which kept repeating itself in
his mind s if he were likely to for
get!
Opposite him and just behind the^
bride the maid of honor stood  Fo£
the moment she, too, had forgotten the
guests, forgotten eerything sae the
fact that the one man in the world
whom she might hae loed— for she
always phrased it thus carefully to
herself — was at that moment owing
to loe and cherish her closest friend
She had a curious feeling that when
she was an old, old wom%n, when a
yellow, withered face and dim, sad
eyes looked back at her from her mir
ror, she should still be able to lie oer
again the despair of this moment, when
the white robed clergyman was taking
him from her life, a thousand times
more irreocably than death could hae
done
There was a stir about her like the
rush of the wind For a second she
was too lost In thought to understand;
then, as she dropped upon her knees
somewhat hurriedly, her bewildered
eyes caught those of the best man, cas
ually at first and then with a quick,
startled recognition of something she
saw there He, too, had the air of a
person suddenly awakened from a
nightmare, momentarily uncertain of
the surroundings In which he found
himself,
 moment later she had forgotten
his ery existence
"He's Ethel's husband now— Ethel's
husband," she said sternly to herself,
skillfully turning a dry sob into a long,
broken breath and composing her face
to the radiant expression becoming the
bride's best friend
Meanwhile the best man admonished
himself in a similar strain "Steady
now, old man! Now's the time to get
out your happy smile" Then, as the
rigid musclqp of his face gae no Indi
cation of relaxing, his thoughts ran on
crosslyPersonal "on't be an ass! It's the
worst eer, so you might as well cheer
UP!" "V
By the time the, great organ pealed
out the triumphant strains of the wed
ding march he and the maid of honor,
their masks on, faced the guests that
filled the church, ready to play their
parts for all they were worth Some
thing in the music was at once an in
spiration and a challenge
"Isn't she sweet?" whispered "one of
the guests to a companion, referring to
the maid of honor "But how pale she
Is, and what a curious look there Is in
her eyes— sort of nothing can eer mat
ter again expression— and yet"—
The speaker stopped, staring thought
fully at the girl until she bad passed
More than once during the course of
the wedding breakfast that followed
the best man found himself watching
her curiously No one was gayer than
she — none so gay, in fact Her eyes
were brilliant, and her laugh rang out
aliantly, but his own misery made
him subtly conscious of some under
current of feeling that was running
strong and pitiless under the surface
bubbles — an undertow of misery that
she was resisting with all her strength
He remembered that when, during
the ceremony, {heir eyes had met in
that confused, uneiled glance she had
been staring at the groom as intently
as he had at the bride Could It be—
He did not formulate the thought, but
he watched her more keenly than eer
after that— so keenly, indeed, that once,
unable to bear it apy longer, with an
appearance of unconsciousness she tax
Ed him with it
"You are ery rude!" she gaid lightly,
but at his grae, sincere "Beliee me, I
hae not meant to be," and the search
ing look that accompanied It, express
ie of a sympathy he could not put
into words, her lips quiered eer so
slightly "Weddings get upon my
neres," she explained, with a little
grimace, and before he could reply she
had turned away
The shower of rice and old shoes had
spent Itself, and the bride and groom
bad departed, taking all the romance
of the world with them and leaing be
hind a monotony without form and
oid ll of the guests felt it, and al
ready the bustle of departure was in
the air But to the best man and the
maid of honor it was a ghastly, appall
ing fact that made them linger on the
steps after the others had reentered
the bouse, staring blankly after the
carriage that had disappeared around
the corner Then the man remembered
where he was and pulled himself to
gether, with an effort '
''Seems rather like the end of things,
doesn't It?" he obsered as they turned
Into the doorway
"From our standpoint, yes," was the
listless answer Then she caught her
lip between her teeth and darted a
quick, inquiring glance at him That
was not precisely what she would hae
chosen to say, and she hoped that he
would not notice it But at the sight of
the somber smile In his eyes the hope
passed
In a snug corner of the deserted li
brary, where the farewells of the de
parting guests came to them but faint
ly, she next found herself, without be
ing ery clear as to how she came

front of her holding one of her hands
!n a protecting, big brotherly fashion,
while she ainly tried to keep back the
tears that seemed to be rising as quiet
ly and relentlessly as a flood It was
so use Higher and higher they came
She winked hard and shut her teeth
irmly Then she snatched Her hand
iway and coered her face
"My poor little girl," murmured the
est man softly
"Weddings are always sad, don't you

syes with her handkerchief and giing
1 little hysterical laugh "Still, I don't
usually behae like this You see, when
Four best friend manies— she— that Is—
serything is different and"—' She gae
ap trying to explain the situation in de
spair and ended with an incoherent,
,'But it's all ery ridiculous, and I don't
mow why I should say all this to
rou"
She was the picture of helpless, girl
ish misery, and the best man's heart
jLgbed for her Momentarily his sympa
chy took the edge off his own loneli
ness He winced at the thought of her
haing to suffer alone the maddening
sense of loss that tormented him
"Perhaps it's because misery loes
company," he said gently "Perhaps
you feel that this wedding hasn't been
altogether like other weddings to me
either," he went on, with a matter of
fict air, as if It were the most natural
thing in the world that they should
be confiding in each other
/She was watching him with a dawn
ing understanding in her eyes, and he
met her gaze with a whimsical smile,
as if he were offering her the open
book of his soul to read if she would
"o you mean that you, too"—
'_ There was no need/to complete the
question, for it was answered before it
was spoken Inoluntarily her hands
went out to him in quick, warm sym
pathy, and though her only comment
was a breathless "Oh!" it was eloquent
with feeling
Little by little her composure came
back to her, ••
•'lt was so good of you to tell me,"
she said gratefully "I think I feel as
Robinson Crusoe did when he disco
ered the man Friday
"Not that I'm glad that you're un
happy, too," she added quickly; "only
it doesn't seem so lonely now that I
know that there is some one who un
derstands fter all, that's what makes
life worth liing, isn't It?" she finished,
looking up at him with what seemed to
him the sweetest look he had eer seen
in 'a girl's face /Personal'
When at the end of six" months the
bride aud groom returned from their
honeymoon abroad the best man and
the maid of honor were among the first
of their dinner guests, ';
"See here; It seems to me that you
two hae been making hay in our ab
sence," laughed the bride, noting with a
woman's quick instinct the deep, strong
understanding that seemed to exist be
tween the two, whereupon her listen
ers exchanged a somewhat humorous,
albeit confused, glance, but refused to
explain
The following June they were mar
ried Just before the Lohengrin march

There are large numbers of whales of
the species rorqual there, and the mon
ster seemed to be their natural enemy
The whales generally trael in schools,
and while, at the surface to blow one
would be singled out and attacked by
the fish, and a battle was soon in order
Xt is the nature of the rorqual to
make three blows at interals of from
two to three minutes each, and then
sound deep and stay beneath the sur
face for thirty or forty minutes s a
whale would come to the surface there
would appear "always at the whale's
right side and just about where his
head would connect with the body a
great long tail or fln, "Judged by fie
fishermen and a number of Indians,
after seeing It about fifteen times at
arious distances," to be about twenty
four feet long, two and onehalf feet
wide at the end and tapering down to
the water, where it seemed to be about
eighteen inches in diameter, looking
ery much like the blade of the fan of
an old fashioned utch windmill
' The great club was used on the back
of the unfortunate whale in such a
manner that it was a wonder to me
that eery whale attacked was not in
stantly killed Its operator seemed to
hae perfect control of its moements
and would bend it back until the end
would touch the water, forming a
horseshoe loop; then with a sweep it
would be straightened and brought
oer and down on the back of the
whale with a whack that could be
heard for seeral miles If the whale
was fortunate enough to submerge it
self before the blows came, the spray
would fly for a distance of a hundred
feet from the effect of the stroke, mak
ing a report as loud as a yacht's signal
gun
What seemed most remarkable to me
was that, no matter which way the
attacked whale went or how fast (the
usual speed Is about fourteen knots),
that great club would follow right
along by its side and delier those tre
mendous blows at interals of about
four or fie seconds It would always
get In from three to fie blows at each
of the three times the whale would
come to the surface to blow The
whale would generally rid itself of the
enemy when It took Its deep sound,
especially if the water was forty
fathoms or more deep ' uring the day
the attack was always offshore, but
at night the whales would be attacked
in the bay and within 00 yards of the
fishery
I do not know of any whales being
killed, but there were seeral that had
great holes and sores on their backs
Questioning the Indians about it, I was
told that there was only one, that it
had been there for many, years and that
It once attacked an Indian canoe and
with one stroke of the great club
smashed the canoe into splinters, kill
ing and drowning seeral of Its occu
pants—Forest and Stream

FCE WITH REVOLUTION
The internal struggles now in
progress between the toiling, down
trodden masses of Russia and the
ruling class of the nobility are sig
nificant of coming reolution The
fires of discontent hae been smolder
ing for many years, but the policy of
undue expansion urged on regard
less of consequences fur the benefit
of the grand dukes, which has re
sulted in the disastrous war with
Japan, has brought on the crisis,
and fanned the incipient discontent
into actie reolt Conditions in
the Russian empire today are ery
similar to those that preailed in
France immediately preceding the
great French reolution  weak
ling king, Louis XVI, was then pre
siding oer the destinies of France
He was a wellrdisposed monarch,
anxious for the welfare of his people,
but lacking in firmness of character
to meet the momentous crisis of that
time Russia is now presided oer
by a weak though goodmeaning em
peror in the person of Nicholas 11
He is simply a tool in the hands of
designing dukdoms, who are for eer
plotting for their own aggrandise
ment, regardless of the distress of
the under classes France oer a
century ago was permeated with
political organization, clamoring for
redress of grieance The people
were ground under the heel of des
potism by burdensome taxation, and
the denial of demands for reform,
until the yoke was too grieous to
be borne Russia is in a similar
plight The laboring population is
oertaxed, illpaid and oerworked
Long hours for a mere pittance of
wages, these wages as well as the
substance of the producing classes —
the agriculturists — eaten up by the
demands of the goernment, hae
brought the masses to despair of
redress by peaceable methods The
right of petition is denied Reolu
tionary clubs known as Nihilists
thrie throughout the empire, and
hae been quietly but indefatigably
spreading their propaganda of re
form This explosie element has
been held in check so far by military
despotism Class prejudices are
strong in the land of the Czar The
peasantry hae little feeling of re
spect for the nobility They regard
them as oppressors On the other
hand the nobles look upon the masses
as ignorant and incapacitated for
any share in the affairs of goern
ment, and fit subjects for oppression
Moreoer, Russia, like France, at the
close of the eighteenth century, is
priest ridden The church has been
a powerful factor in holding the
masses in subjection The church
and the goernment are practically
the same The Czar is the ciil and
religious head of the Russian people,
and no where, not een in Moslem
countries, does eneration for the
natie faith exist to a greater extent
than in Russia t the outbreak of
the Japanese war sacred relics and
images — ikons — were shipped to the
front by car loads It was in defer
ence to the idea that in the presence
of the symbols of their faith Russian
arms were inincible, een in a war
that was far from being popular
with the masses The stern logic of
facts has brushed aside all these
claims The armies of the Mascoite
hae met with uniform defeat in
stead of ictory as promised The
recruiting of the army by forced con
scription is being resisted; workmen
at the goernment factories are on
strike, the industries of the country
are paralized, the royal family has
fled, frightened at the menacing at
titude of the populace; the military,
to subdue the turbulence, has shot
the people down by hundreds in
sight of the imperial palace, thereby
widening the gap between the con
tending factions — the one resoled
to arbitrary and despotic measures,
the other resoled to be free Where
will it end On the ee of the
mighty upheaal in France, an eye
witness of the scenes of iolence and
lawlessness in the streets remarked
to one of the leaders of the popular
uprising, "This is insurrection"
"Sire, it is reolution," was the sig
nificant and prophetic reply
In Kansas they hae apparently
soled the attache scandal The last
legislature had 232 attaches The
eil had been growing for many
years, and reached its climax at the
aboe stated limit  howl was
made, and a reform moement under
the significant name of Boss Busters
was inaugurated, and got in its work
in good shape The legislature now
in session in that state is getting
along swimmingly with 36 attaches
 boss buster campaigu might be
profitable, as it certainly would be
popular, in California mador
county is about ripe for such a
crusadd
PROPOSE CONSTITUTION CON
VENTION
Ihe subject of calling another con
stitutional conention to frame a
brand new state constitution is being
discussed It is likely that the leg
islature will take action in that di
rection at this session The present
constitution was adopted when the
sandlot agitation was at its flood
The organic law bears the impress
of that moement Few will deny
that it is far from being a model con
stitution It has taken all these
years to hae its doubtful proisions
interpreted by the supreme court
Moreoer it is a long way from be
ing fully and stably settled yet The
same process of interpretation would
hae to be goue through again in
the eent of a new constitution
The law would then for years be in a
more uusettled condition than it is
now It would take many years to
reach the antage ground we occupy
now, if a new constitution were
sprung upon us Faulty though
our fundamental law may be, it is
doubtful if a constitutional conen
tion would remedy matters We
can  better mend the defects by
amendments than attempt the cure
all process of a new instrument Of
course to call a constitutional con
ention would require a faorable
ote of the people The expense of
a conention wQuld be heay, with
the chances of betterment extremely
slim The Ledger is of the opinion
that we can do better by sticking to
the old document, and patching it
up at interals, as we hae been do
ing for the past twenty years
11
Bean the The Kind You Hae lways Bought
The people of the state generally
would takemore stock in the pro
fessions of reform of the legislatie
solons now in session at Sacramento
if the law makers would first tackle
the abuses within their own ranks
They certainly do not expect much
from a body of grafters who pile on
attaches so that they are tumbling
oer each other, and are really an
impediment rather than a help in
the line of legislatie work It has
got to be a serious question whether
the members are running the at
taches, or the attaches running the
legislators "Physician heal thy
self," is a motto which the California
legislators would do well to apply to
themseles There is no branch of
the goernment that is more in need
of reform than the state legislature
That body seems to think that its
most important work is to fasten an
army of attaches upon the public
treasury The people pray to be de
liered from the biennial raids of
these law makers It is the crying
eil, whose baleful influence tends to
demoralize the state goernment ,^\
CSTOni
Bean the _^ hB Kind Yob Haw lways Bought
The direct legislation league has
had introduced a proposed constitu
tional amendment proiding for the
initiatie and referendum in state,
cities and counties ny ordinance
of city or county or law of the state
must be submitted to a ote of the
people on a petition signed by ten
per cent of the qualified oters
Notwithstanding the slow and cum
bersome method of law making which
this would entail, it is realized by
many thinking men throughout the
state that this plan affords a solu
tion of the problem of getting rid of
unwholesome enactments which are
passed for the benefit of a few inter
ested parties
There is much talk about abolish
ing the state poll tax It is the
most unpopular tax eer deised,
cry these abolitionists Is any form
of taxation popular with the par
ticular class that has to plank down
the coin? People are not enamored
with taxation of any sort They pay
taxes from necessity rather than
choice The poll tax is most unpop
ular because it hits the largest num
ber It is not an unjust tax It is
the only way of reaching tens of
thousands of persons who, while
sharing in the benefits of goern
ment, would otherwise contribute
nothing to its support To repeal
the poll tax would wipe half a mil
lion dollars from the state's income,
and this at a time when statesmen
are racking their brains to find new
sources of reenue to meet the grow
ing demands of goernment

Letter From Sacramento
Sacramento, Jan 25 — The real
important legislation is beta? worked
out in committees, especially the joint
committee which is sitting eery morn
ing with the goernor for the purposo
of reforming the laws Of course noth
ing is more important than the system
of taxation in a community 'lt was
because our reolutionary fathers ob
jected to the scheme of taxation pro
posed by the English parliament that
the United States is today one of the
great nations of tho world If this
legislature shall reform the tax system
of California it will hae made a record
for itself, and that is just what it is
going to do, the pessimists to the con
trary notwithstanding While the
exact system that is to take the place
of the presont system has not been
worked out as yet in detail, neertho
jess its radical principle is known It
is indirect as opposed to direct taxa
tion Instead of land and property of
that character bearing the chief bur
den, it might also bo said the entire
burden of taxation, as it does now
under the new scheme, the saloons, the
corporations and the luxuries of life
ljke automobiles will be the subjects of
taxation
The sum to be raised is, $6,000,000
The state spends $9,000,000, but the
other three millions are raised in se
eral ways that do not require direct
taxation The schools for instance,
hae incomes from inestments, and
there are minor sources of roonue Of
the expenditures of the state more than
one half is spent in caring for the chil
dren and unfortunate, and indeed if thu
charitable expenditures bo added the
cost of the state goernment is ory
little It is proposed to raiso this
money first by a state tax on saloons
Tho tax will be about $200 a year, pay
able quarterly, and there will be enough
saloons to make tho yearly income from
that sourco about a million It, is cal
culated that sixteen per cent of the sa
loons, or about a thousand, will be
drien out of business, as besides tho
state thero will be tho regular federal
and county taxes, or city if the saloon
is in a municipality, to pay There are
said to be 55,000 corporations in this
stato, and if they pay only ten dollars
a year tho income is not to be despised,
but it will be graded and tbo chances
that a million more than $550,000 will
be raised from them
Thero is tho poll tax, but this is more
likely to be repealed than anything
else, for of all the taxes that hae eer
been deised the poll tax seems to be
the most unpopular Tbo proposition
is also to make an inheritance tax, and
to make it apply to direct as well as
collateral inheritances as it does now
It is thought that that will raiso nearly
a million more So far'as corporations
are concerned the burden of taxation
on those which own property will be
no greater than it is now, only it will
be differently assessed and collected
It is probable that the new tax bills
will not entirely do away with direct
taxation Possibly only one half of the
amount needed for the state expenses
will be collected under the new system,
which will be gradually enlarged as the
years go by until direct taxation ceases,
but the tax will only be enough under
the present system to pay the school
bills, which is about 223 per hundred
The matter; is of such importance that
it deseres to bo generally discussed,
for of course no one in the entire state
will be uneffected directly or indirectly
by the new laws Nothing more rad
ical has been proposed since California
entered the union
Of scarcely less importance than the
taxation schemos are tboso for prison
reform, for thero is no more crying eil
in California than the condition of the
state prisons The committee haing
the matter in charge on the assembly
side of the eauitol has spent many
eenings going oer the bills and care
fully inestigating them, and as a re
sult they hae laid before tho assembly
a complete change in the system of the
two reform schools and tho two prisons
The bills were reported back on Tues
day, and are understood to hae tho
indorsement of tho goernor They
wore prepared with great care by Pres
cott and McKenney originally, and
hae now been studied by Lynch, Bliss,
morige, Beckette, Ells, Olmstead,
Bolyle and Wickersham One of the
best lays is a bill repealing the existing
law which proides that counties shall
pay for the care of tho persons sent to
either Whittier or the Preston School
of Industry, which has led many judges
to send boys to the penitentiary to
sae their county eleen dollars a
month
That was the pet measure of Beckott
of San Francisco, who by securing the
repeal will not only do an act that will
be of great benefit to many boys who
might be saed from ruin by being sent
to reform schools instead of tho state
prisons, ! but who has also saed his
county a thousand dollars and more a
month that it is now spending for boys
it has sent to one or other of the
schools So far as tho public is con
cerned it will mako no difference, as
they hae simply been paying the
monoy all along, and it will now remain
in tho county instead of going into the
state treasury
No boys under sixteen will bo sent to
Preston if the new system preails, and
only children under sixteen to Whittier,
if they are boys Girls go to Whittior
until they are twentyone, though they
are only committed there when they
are under eighteen  First termers go
to San Quentin and second termers to
Folsom Criminals and conicts insane
will probably be sent to tho state hos
pital in Mendocino coimty near Ukiah
The farmers and the professors of the
state uniersity are likely to come to a
collision oer the question of the agri
cultural college appropriations Tho
president, regents and professors want
a building at Berkeley in which thoy
can carry on experiments and educate
nominal farmers So far their grad
uates hae not aeraged one a year, so
the effect of the college on the farming
community of California has boen abso
lutely nil But it is now proposed to
hae a farm where experiments can be
carried on, and wouldbe farmers get
a thoroughly practical education Tho
sum of $250,000 is asked for that pur
pose President Wheeler declares ho
faors the farm idea, but tho friends
of the farmers hae ory little confi
dence in Wheelor, whom" thoy beliee
is at heart opposed to them, and who
looks down on the agricultural com
munity Ho mado cortain promises
two years ago when tho same subject
was before tho legislature, which the
friends of the education of farmer boys
beliee he has not kopt, and this year
ho came hero and adocated cutting
the appropriations for tho farm and
building in half, which of course would
cripple the former project far more
than the latter, as a farm will need
money to equip and start, while a
building can be put up slowly and more
money secured two years hence There
is therefore a controersy between
building and farm, though tho farm
seems to bo on top at this writing
Charles  Vogelsang, chief deputy
on the board of fish commissioners, is
here in the interest of the gun clubs
and wealthier classes in tho stato, and
has succeedod in securing the intro
duction of a number of bills which
would forbid any one in California buy
ing a duck, and would preent the
poorer classes fishing and hunting for
a liing It is one of the worst bills
and clearest cases of class legislation
eer proposed in the state Ho pro
poses to tax eery man who carries a
gun in the state, and would forbid fish
ing as well as hunting Ido not think
the people of California appreciate
what this man is trying to do, although
he is their serant and is drawing a
large salary out of tho treasury whilo

ho is hero lobbying in the interests of

farmers and boys who go hunting on

is being made to make those amuse

always been the right of the many? o

Carlo Garbarino Meets eath in the Key
stone Mine in a Singular Manner
 singular fatality occurred in the
Keystone mine at mador City on Sun
day morning last This mine has on
joyed a long period of freedom from
fatal accidents, ami the caso that oc
curred there this week whs of that kind
that no foresight or care could possibly
guard against c Italian named Carlo
Gatbarino was working in thestopes at
the COO foot leel He was one of three
men employed at that particular point
His companions were engaged in drill
ing, while Garbarino was shoeling
and clearing away the debris of the last
charge  large rock, too big to pass
through tho chute, was encountered
His two companions by a fortunate
chance had retired temporarily, ono
for a drink of water and the other on
some other mission They were only
away a few seconds, and that brief
absence doubtless saed their lies In
order to dispose of this large rock Gar
barino took a sledge hammer and pro
ceeded to break it up, all unconscious
of the fact that it contained within
itself deathdealing forces It is not
an uncommon occurrence that in dis
charging a number of holes some holes
miss lire owing to the extinguishment
of the fuses by the debris from the ex
ploding holes It also happens that in
the explosion, masses of rock are blown
from the nonexploding holes, the de
tached rock carrying portions of the
unexploded powder charge This is
supposed to hae been the case with
the mass of rock wbich Garbarino
undertook to break up It was loaded
The concussion of blows from the ham
mer caused the dynamite to explode
Garbarino recoied the full force of the
charge He was frightfully mangled,
head, arms, and body The death
wounds, howeer, were in the region
of the groin, the right leg being broken
and the regiop of the thigh and hip
mangled in a shocking manner One
of his follow workers was within tho
radius of the explosion and was pitted
slightly with the flying debris, but no
serious harm was done him Poor Gar
barino was taken to the surface as soon
as possible He was conscious, and
moaned out as bis life forces were
ebbing rapidly away, "dieu, my
children" His thoughts wandered off
to his natie Italy, where his wife and
children were lopated He was asked
if he wanted the priest or doctor He
was resigned to accept the serices of
either or both  doctor was soon in
attendance, and while the surgeon was
attending to his injuries ha expired
Ho lied two hours after receiing the
injuries
Justice W L Rose held an inquest
tho same day Tho jury returned a
erdict of accidontal death in accord
ance with the facts Tho retrains, were
brought to Jackson, and the funeral
was held on Tuesday, the remains be
ing interred in the Catholic graeyard,
the Re Father Gleeson conducting
the ceremonies' eceased has a brother
liing at Jackson Gate, at whoso re
quest the funeral obsequies were hold
here  '   ' " _
eceasod was about 36 years of age
Ho leaes a wife and two children in
Italy, whom he oxpectod to send for as
soon as he had accumulated money
sufficient for their passage He had
been in the state but six months, and
had worked at the Keystone only 18
shifts when death oertook him in the
manner narrated

The new 65 ton locomotie for the
lone and Eastern railroad was receied
at lone last week It was built at
Lima, Ohio Of this mammoth haul
ing machine the Echo saysPersonal
"The engines, three in' number, are
on the right side of the boiler, and are
connected to a tumbling rod which
transmits power to tho wheels by a
beel cog system The wheels, three
pairs, are all driers, and are all at
tached to the power There Is on"c
pair of wheejs under the forward end
of the boiler,' one 'tinder the oil tank
and one under the water tank There
are no wheels under the engines or
rear part of the boiler, that part of the
machine is supported by brace rods
from the first tender The wheels are
of small diameter and the engine is
buiit'fpr pulling,' but not for speed' s
it weighs 65 tons and the steel' pn the
road is ery light, it remains to be seen
what cap be hauled oer it The new
locomotie has been concerted into, an
oil burner and It is expected that it will
go into commission today"
Some difficulty is being experienced
with the embankment between Miller's
station and lone The formation is
clay, and the filling is, of eqqs(derable
hight — In fact, the highest on the
route Tho rains hae so saturated
the soil that much trouble has arisen
oer the sinking of the road bed Fifty
men were at work Saturday ballasting
the track It is merely a question of
time when the fillings will be thorough
ly settled and in cqnditipn to stand the
 heay trael!
Tho grading operations hae reached
a point a couple of miles east of Moun
tain Springs Rapid progress may be
looked for from now on, as fiilly three
fourths of the total grading and filling
work has been done The main con
struction camp was moed last week
from below Mouutain Springs to a
point two milos further east It is
thought one more shift will sutjiae to
carry the operations to Martell's sta
tion
 corps of sureyors were put to
work sureying a line from Martell's
to mador City and beyond It is the
intention of the company to oxturid the
line in this direction without delay It
will bo pushed to completion at the
earliest possible moment The site for
the depot at Martell's will In all likeli
hood be on the Oneida Mining Com
pany's ground We upderstand the
route from Oneida tpward Jackson has
been partially mapped out and will be
definitely sureyed in a few days
There seems to be no doubt that the
depot will be located at a desirable spot
within easy access to the business part

Salosn Burglarized at Midnight— Bobbery
Frustrated by the ppearance of Proprietor,
who Takes a Couple of Shots at Intruder
 daring attempt was made to rob,
the saloon and stpre kept by George
BakQichan'd LRadoich fronting the
bridge at the north end of Main street,
shortly after midnight this morning
It was about closing up time, and Bak
oich was in charge He locked up
the premises about midnight, while he
went to a restaurant to get sorqe coffeo,
leaing three lights burning, one being
in a retyr room In which dry goods are
kept There was considerable money
on hand at the time— nearly $100 In the
barroom till, and $00 stowed away in
a cigar box The money was ahout to
be sent to Sat} piranoisoo! ' Bakoich
was away about half an hour, and re
turned to get his oercoat, Nearing
the saloon, he beard a noise iti the rear
which satisfied him that someone was
in the act of burglarizing the prpmlses
He thereupon hastened to his home on
Court street for his gun— a formidable
threochainbored combination weapon
of shotgun and rifle He was back in
a few minutes, alone He noticed that
the two rear lights had been turned off,
only one in the saloon bu,rn,ip<j, Peer
ing through the front window, he saw
a man In the act of lifting the lid of a
cigar box that stood on a sideboard be
hind the bar counter He blazed away
with the rifle part The ball went wide
of its mark, but passed through the
door between the saloon and dry goods
room, and plowed a grooe In the wood
work of the side, passed through the
rear room, and finally buried itself in
the uext building The wouldbe rob
ber, thus surprised in his lawless work,
beat a hasty retreat through, the door
of a woodshed in thc rear, jumped into
the creek, and made his escape by fol
lowing the crock bod in a northerly di
rection Bakoich took another shot
at him as he ran up the creek Bako
ich did not see the burglar's face, and
is unablo to gie any descriptionjof him
other than he wore a cowboy hat He
secured no money nor booty pf any
sort He entered tho promises through
a sliding window in the rear woodshed,
forcing the slender fastening of the
door connecting the woodshed with the
drygoods room The sheriff's office was
notified of the affair, but there is abso
lutely no clew to the Identity of the
perpetrator

Wildman — Twenty stamps are now
in operation on ore from the 100foot

Oneida — Underground foreman

his brother, who is not expected to lie
but a short time Supt Hampton is
not only attending to his regular duties,
but is seeing that Mr Noce's work is
being properly attended lo by those in
charge The mill is running to its full
est capacity on low grade ore, but by
careful management the mine is being
worked on a paying basis, and will un
doubtedly continue so for many years
South Eureka— The new mill at
this mine is crushing about 100 tons
per day; the old mill not so much
Much of the ore is taken from the 200
foot leel bout three tons of sul
phurets are being made dally, but some
difficulty is being experienced in get
ting them hauled to the railroad, owing
to tho condition of the roads The
new mill runs like clockwork, no dif
ficulty being had so far with any of its
mechanism Much interest Is being
manifested In the next cleanup, which
will undoubtedly be the largest in  the
history of the mine'
Zeila — t this mine drifting toward
the ledge at the 100 leel has been
pushed a considerable distance t

station is under way "Sinking is not
being prosecuted at present The
cement foundation for the now hoist is
completed, and is a massie' and solid
structure The iron base plates are in
position, but beyond this none of the
machinery is in place or on the ground
It will be soipe time before the under

is proposed to drill into the solid cement
and introduce wood blocks under the

School Matters
The Jackson school will reqnen qext
Monday, after a two weeks' shutdown
on account of diphtheria TUe closing
of school because of a case or two of
contagion is iewed iq different ways
Much unfaorable comment is Indulged
in at this course It is contended that
to hae tho children play around the
streets and circulate among each other
in churches and in many other ways is
equally as bad, as far as from
infection is pp,n,£pruedV as to attend
gyhQpi What good result oan possibly
come from closing school? Teachers
are paid a full month's salary for a few
days' work The children are depried
of educational facilities, and state and
county pay for serice^ ! Q 'y partially
rondered The o,nly" object gained is
the danger pf haing the apportion
ment curtailed by reason of reduced
aerage attendance, as it is assumed
some parents would hesitate to send
their children to school while any cases
of contagion are abroad The feelin"
is gaining that the policy of closing
school because Qf isolated cases of
diphtheria pr any other contagion', is
all wrong What would be thought in
largo cities If tho school authorities
pursued tho same course there The
schools would close for good, for cases
of infectious disease are always with
them It is time country schools got
oer the bugaboo of "ho'sohool unless
a cleaq bili'of health is gien," een
though the outcome be' a few dollars
less in school appropriation The in
terests of all children should not be
sacrificed on any such sentimental altar,

| the money that has been spent on this
highway in the effort to make it fairly

is ineitable that the undertaking is a
failure The truth is foroed home that
the county is not equal to the task of
keeping It in repair We do not say
this as a reflection upon the manage

discussing that proposition it i 3i 3
enough to say that a portion of this

Where
Extremes
Meet
Copyright, 1901,, by Otho B Senga
Hammond, strong, alert, silent, guid
ed his dashing automobile in and out
amid the crush of traffic His compan
ion was silent also, which fact might
hae disconcerted a less obserant
man than Hammond
He stopped the machine before a
massie granite building and sprang to
the sidewalk Miss Markham watched
him absently He had said that he
must stop at his office, but the waiting
was not unwelcome to her She liked
to watch the great drays and heay
wagons and to obsere the sights and
sounds of this unfamiliar part of the
city
Presently she noticed that Hammond
hnd not entered the building, but was
standing in the doorway, looking up
"SHLL WE LOOK FOB IT TOGETHEB,
ELIZBETH ?"
and down the street as If watching for
some one He caught her wandering
glance and waed his hand, smiling
brightly Then he put both hands to
his mouth, making a horn, and called
something to her, which she could not
hear aboe the roar of the street
"He Is like a boy," she thought and
laughed in sympathy with his eident
joyousness "There Is neer any gloom
or any uncertainty about him," adding
sadlyPersonal "Men are so sure of themseles
—and of one another I wish— l wish I
knew if he thinks only of my money,
as all the others seem to do"
Still watching his eager face, she
knew that whateer he had been wait
Ing for was coming, and he pointed up
the street and laughed again as he ran
lightly down the steps
 Two young Italians, a man and a
woman, were making ready to play
The girl wore a rose wreath on her
dark hair, and her eyes were filled with
the light of loe as she looked fondly
In the face of her companion
The strains of the music came to Miss
Markham in fitful snatches, mingled
with the noises of the street She saw
that Hammond was listening as If to a
symphony, and she wondered a little
as to the meaning of the scene She
saw hhn place something in tke girl's
small brown hand, and then the man
took off his cap with low obeisance,
and the girl courtesied prettily as Ham
mond raised his hat politely and made
his way to the automobile
"What Is It?" she questioned briefly
as he took bis seat
"Only the beautiful outcome of a lit
tle romance that I hae watched as it
blossomed here amid the sordid rush
of business"
"They are loers, these two?" fall
Ing in with his mood
"Yes Wedded last night Two mag
nificent types of primitie humanity 1"
with the enthusiasm of artistic percep
tion Personal ;
They watched the two as they went
down the street, each pushing the pi
ano with one hand, while the other
hands were clasped
"Will you tell me about them?" she
askecP j\s they reached a broad, quiet
aenue away from the din and confu
sion of tile city
"re you really interested?" turning
to look at tier curiously ' ,"
"Very much so Tlease tell me"
"They are ntolne and Carita They
may hae other names These are all
I know I hae watched them from
my window all winter He had a tiny
fruit stand on the corner, and she was
errand girl in a big millinery establish
ment on the next street I saw the
first loe glances, and I swear by Bun
Jfeer Hill they did not come from n
foine" _ "
Miss Markham laughed softly 
"I watciied Carlta passing and re
passing, making seeral trips by the
little stand for eacn' errand, JJien
there would be days when she did not
come at all, and ntolne's neck would
hae been safer in those days if It had
really been made of rubber instead of
the material proided by the Creator"
Miss Markham smiled appreciatiely
She could fancy the ardent Italian gaz
ing up and down the street watching
for his sweetheart
"Well, occasionally making pretense
of an abnormal desire for bananas, I
rushed out to the stand while she was
still lingering there, and so I some
times oerheard a few sentences— their
HUN LEGER <# WEEKLY CHICGO Iflltl
— $250 PER YEIt  
loft Italian" loe words sounding like
bird notes In spring Can't you fancy
them building a nest somewhere of
boughs and moss— they wouldn't re
quire much more than the birds, you
know— and settling down like the birds
to sing their loe songs and rear their
young?"
Otho B
Senga
 new light shone in Miss Mark
bam's clear eyos
"nd this is the man whom the girls
describe as a mere business automa
ton," she thought, but she only said
encouragingly, "Well?"
Hammond's head swam for an in
stant with a comprehension of the
magnitude of what he meant to do, but
he went on steadily
"The day of the tornado— you remem
ber it— when the wind tore shutters
from the houses and oerthrew chim
neys and great limbs were stripped
from the trees as the small boy pulls
leaes from a twig— that day I wit
nessed the downfall of the house of
Buona— ln other words, the complete
destruction of ntolne's fruit stanfl
and peanut cooker"
Miss Markham sighed with quick
sympathy Hammond was uncpn
Bdously giing the little story a dra
matic turn
"Poor ntolne! He made one or two
frantic endeaors to preent the disas
ter, and then, crushed by the misfor
tune, he clung to the doorway of the
office building and watched the gamins
as they wildly scrambled for the scat
tered fruit"
"nd was eerything entirely ru
ined?" Miss Markham' hand instinc
tiely sought her purse
"The peanut cooker lay in the mud,
bent and twisted out of all semblance
tq its kind ntolne picked it up with
trembling hands and then, realizing its
uselessness, replaced It in the gutter,
while the tears streamed down his
cheeks" '
"That Isn't all?" expectantly ; \ ;1
Hammond continued obedientlyPersonal
" 'Neer mind, ntoine,' I said cheer
fully—it's so easy_ to be cheerful oer
another's misfortunes, you know—
'you'll soon be on your feet again We
must expect reerses In bustness' t
my words of sympathy the flood gates
of his grief were opened, and the
words fairly tumbled oer one another,
his soft broken English finally relaps
ing into Italian altogether as he told
his story He had been so careful of
his money— he had saed twentythree
'dolla' They were to hae been mar
ried tomorrow, he and Carita, and he
was to hae bought Carita a new gown
and a rose wreath for her hair, and
they would hae been so happy! nd
now— then he pointed eloquently to
the ruined peanut cooker, waed both
hands in a gesture expressing the utter
nothingness of his condition, and the
ready tears came again
"I missed him then for seeral
weeks The other day they came to
gether and waited until I came out
from the office 'My brudda— he die,'
began ntoine cheerily as soon as I
Joined them 'n' leae ntolne se
entyfour dolla,' said Carita, her eyes
big with the magnitude of the for
tune 'n' his business,' ntolne add
ed pompously 'id he hae a stand?'
I asked him 'No, a piano We mar
ry ourseles tonight, Thursday' "
Hammond paused abruptly The ex
pression on Miss Markham's patrician
face_ was so unlike the usual air of po
lite  indifference that he was almost
startled Into the telling of his own
story, forgetful of the Italian loers
"That is all," he added awkwardly
"nd how Hd you know they would
be at your office this morning?" as if
reluctant to leae the subject
"ntoine hunted me up last night—
at the club Said his wife— you should
hae seen his eyes's"oien he said the
word— his wife wantl'to come and
play for me first, belieing it would
bring them luck I hadn't intended to
go downtown this morning, as you
know, but I thought that was really
ery little to do if it would add any
thing to their happiness Foolish
things, aren't they?" He turned his
head away She would • agree with
this, of course, and he couldn't bear to
hae her do so
She put her hand lightly on his arm
"No, they are not foolish They are
wise They hae found the greatest
thing in the world Those who win
loe need, look no farther; there is noth
ing more to hae here They who lose
it lose eerything
He put his own strong hand oer the
smaller one resting' on his arm'
"Shall we look for it— together, Eliza
beth?"
She looked hastily about— there was
no one near; they were quite in the
country now— and raised her beautiful
face to his "I think we hae found
it already," she whispered
 Very Large Mine
There was once in Cripple Creek an
odd character named Burns He was
an odd person^ who always, no mat
ter what his work, wore what used to
be called a "Prince lbert" He struck
a rich ein of ore and named that the
Prince lbert Being of a generous
and  coniial disposition, this lucky
fellow was, of course, surrounded by
many self, seeking friends When he
and they were in their cups some of
them, with an eye to the main chance,
managed to wheedle out of Barns on
one | pretext or another a deed of a
share in his mine With royal prodi
gality he scattered deeds about among
his retainers and camp followers un
til finally something had to be done,
and the case was taken Into court
One of the lawyers had Burns on the
stand "Now, Mr Burns," said the
lawyer, "will you please tell the court
how you can explain your conduct?
The eidence shows that you hae
deeded away twentynine twenty
fourths of 'your mine What hae you
to say to that?" "Well, sir," replied
the witness, "you must remember, sir,
that the Prince lbert Is a ery large
mine"

 LEPGE PICTURE
The Work That Brought the rtist
Public Recognition
The label on "a certain spring water
still In use was designated by 
Maurler, who was probably not oer
paid for it, and a New York artist who
has since gained distinction eked out
the hardest part of his early struggles
by designing adertisements for a
commercial house There hae been
many more perhaps, but the most con
spicuous on record is Bastlen Lepage,
who through this ery fact was forced
into fame He was pursued by unmer
ciful disaster through his youth in his
efforts to study art His mother worked
In the fields to keep a sickly boy at
school t fifteen he went alone to
Paris, stared for seen years, painted
without success, but still— painted He
had Just finished a picture to send to
the Salon when Paris was besieged,
and he rushed with his comrades to
the trenches
On the first day a shell fell into his
studio and "destroyed his picture, 'and
another shell burst at his feet, wound
ing him He was carried home and lay
ill and idle for two years Then he re
turned to Paris and, reduced to abso
lute want, painted cheap fans for a
liing
One day a manufacturer of some pat
ent medicine ordered a picture from
him to illustrate its irtues Lepage,
who was always sincere, gae his best
work to this adertisement' He paint
ed a landscape In the pril sunlight
The leaes of tender green quiered in
the breeze  group of beautiful young
girls gathered around a fountain from
which the elixir of youth sprang in a
bubbling stream, i Lepage belieed there
was real merit in it
"Let me offer it at the Salon?" he
asked his patron
The manufacturer was delighted
"But first paint a rainbow arching oer
the fountain," he said, "with the name
of my medicine uponlt"
Lepage refused
 "Then I will not pay you a sou for
the picture" ,;
The price of this picture meant bread
for months, and the painter had long
needed bread The chance of admis
sion to the salon was small He hesi
tated Then he silenced his hunger and
carried the canas to the salon It was
admitted
 Its great success insured Lepage
public recognition, and his later work
gained him a place among the greatest
of liing artists
PROVERBS OF MEXICO
The noise is more than the powder—
the Mexican way of saying it is "hot
air"
When it rains, we all get wet— the
Mexican way of saying, "Misfortunes
neer come singly" 
The deil is not astute because he is
the deil, but because he Is old— used
to express the alue of experience
When bread is cut, crumbs are left,
expressing the fact that we all hae a
share in our neighbors' good fortune '
fter the child is drowned, coer up
the well — the Mexican way of saying,
''fter the horse Is stolen, lock the
stable" ,
It Is better to go around than to fall
down, expressing the fact that It Is
often better to aoid a difficulty than
to try to oercome it — Chicago Jour

Would Blake Sure bout the Soap
 little boy who had been blowing
bubbles all the morning, tiring of play
and suddenly growing serious, said,
"Read me that thory about heaen; il
ith tho glorlouth"
"I will," said the mother, "but first
tell me, did you take the soap out of
the water?"
"Oh, yes; I'm pretty thure I did"
The mother read the description of
the beautiful city, the streets of gold,
the gates of pearl He listened with
delight, but when ' she came to the
words, "No one can enter there who
loeth or maketh a lie," bounding up,
he saidPersonal
"I gueth I'll go and tbee about that

Entangled In a Ilc Wire
If a person is tangled in a lie elec

therefrom do not take hold of the ic

of this kind You will be shocked if
you do Be sure to grab the clothes
alone, and then you are safe, and the
current cannot reach you o not let
anything come in contact with your
bare hands but his coat and trousers
Of course if you hae thick leather
