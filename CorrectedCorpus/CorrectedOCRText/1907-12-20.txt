.. Governor Gillett .is credited with favoring an, increase in
the number of bank commissioners as a -. safeguard against
a recurrence of such rottenness in banking methods as has
been brought to light by the collapse of the California safe
deposit and trust company. It may or may not be true that
three commissioners are- inadequate to keep track of the
1 standing of all the banking institutions of the state. The
policy of scattering responsibility among a larger number of
individuals- has never been found to, work well in actual
practice. ..There is no guarantee that there would not be as
many lapses with a score of commissioners as with three.
Concentration of v - responsibility as a rule secures the better
service.. . That a radical reform is necessary in the manner of
protecting the public against wildcat banking is evident, and
a good starter in that direction would be the ousting of the
present commissioners who ,have allowed the defunct bank
to fleece depositors for years under their official sanction.
The special holidays are to be discontinued after to-mor
row. The banks have recovered from the financial scare so
as to justify a return to normal business conditions. The
people too have about gotten over their temporary and per
haps needless fright, and are trotting back their hoarded
money into the customary channels of trade. Any serious run
onthe banks consequent upon the lifting of the blockade inci
dent to forced - holidays is improbable; ■'■> The volume of busi
ness throughout the country has been materially curtailed
by the stringency, and the causes contributory thereto, and
the process of getting back to the high plane of pre-panic
times will be slow. Here in Amador county business has
moved along satisfactorily throughout, almost unconscious of
the monetary stress that was raging outside. We have main
tained without effort a gold-cash basis all through.
" Three, hundred thousand tons of coal had to be provided
the naval squadron in making the trip from the Atlantic to
the Pacific coast, a quantity sufficient to ; bury the business
portion of Jackson.
fcj AMADOR LEDGEE,: JACKSON ,, C AtT^ t
Amador's Gold Product;
Ihe output of gold for Amador
county for IUO6 is very gratifying.
It is one of the heaviest yields for
this section of the mother lode that
we have had since early days. It is
iigureil in the bulletin just issued
from the office of the state mineral
ogist, L9wiß<§. Aubrey, at 52,260,376.
That is nearly an average o£ SIBO,OOC
per month. **We leaii all other coun
ties of the cjpartz mining class, ex
cept Nevada, and Nevada leads us by
less than $100,000. We are far ahead
of our near neighbors of the mother
lodo belt, as the following official
figures will show.
Amador - - - 52,2G0,H7G
Ualaveras - - - 1,014,234
Xl Dorado - - - 431, 74 d
Tuolumne - - - 1,039,675
So that we contributed mote than
twice as much gold as the once fam
ous Tuolumne, and over 8600,000 more
than Calaveras, which a fen years
back outstripped us in bullion pro
duction. In total mineral output, we
are still outpointed by Calaveras,
owing to the heavy yield in^copper
of that county, which last year
amounted to nearly a million dollars.
Amador at present contributes very
little in either silver or copper.
However, as a gold section it ought
to command a great deal more atten
tion from capitalists on the lookout
for profitable investment than it is
receiving at present. Uur foothills
carry the gold. There is no disput
ing that fact. And the gold bearing
quartz is proven to go much deeper
into the bowels of the earth than has
been proven at any other point in
California.

; Itiis certain that this question will
be one of = the most Important ones
coping before this -congress. But
that any • attempt by- the California
delegation to place Japanese on the

matter of immigration, . will be: op
posed by the administration is made
certain by the president's 'announce
ment to congressmen Hayes and Kahu
that he" is decidedly opposed to auy
bill exolnding Japanese laborers. .' <
Ihe . Washfngton < "Post 1 ! regards
it as a very significant that five min
utes after the departure of the' Cali
fornia congressmen, the Japanese am
bassador ! arrived for a conference
with, the president. -Later, the an
nouncement that the ambassador bad
been recalled to Japan gave rise to
rumcrs of diplomatic difficulties on
the Japanese immigration j question,
which is complicated by the orders to
our big Beet to proceed to the Pacific.
But there is yet no authentic infor
mation as to any diplomatic difficulty
having arisen.
Ihe chamber of commerce of San
Francisco is making an effort to se
cure for the merchants of that city a
part at least of the supplies' for the
Panama canal work. Senator Perkins
placed the ' matter ■ before the ■ canal
commission and has . requested that
Sail Francisco dealers be recognized.
Lieutenant H: b\ Hodges, the general
purchasing officer, of the commission,
has stated to \ the'. senator. '.that : pur
chases of provisions^^hi'dh ithe cham
ber of commerce particularly referred
to, are made through .the purchasing
agent of the ;Pauama : Kailroad Com

mises that opx'ortuoity'will. bo -given
to San Francisco dealers to make bids
for.the ensuing, six months. ' It has
been the custom, be says, to invite
bids from all parts of .the > country,
and to award contracts in accordance
with ■ the price 1 and • quality • ot.'the
goods. At the last, letting ;of ; : con
tracts, after the bids were opened and
classified, samples were requested
from the three lowest "bidders," and
the award given to that Mine of the
three ■. bids ;, which .- seemed most ad
vantageous to the government. : . San
Francisco merchants will ■do well,
therefore, to '; give consideration v to
this matter and prepare themselves to
make bids for the^ supplies to /be ad
vertised for in February. next.
. Notification has been received by
Senator Perkins ' that - the ' dedication
at San' Diego of the monument to the
Bennington 's dead,, originally ■: fixed
for December 12th, : has been : postpon
ed, but no later date has yet been
determined upon. ■'
A vigorous effort will be made dar
ing the session to - secure \ the estab
lishment of a naval station somewhere
on San Francisco bay, and others at
San ; Diego and San : Pedro. . Such
stations ; will . become '.absolutely
necessary by reason ot the increase in
the strength of the United States fleet
in the Pacific.; That the navy depart
ment will ' recommend ', the
ment of : a station* .'can ; hardly > be
doubted, the only question being its
location.' The people of Oakalnd "are
alive to the importance of the pro
