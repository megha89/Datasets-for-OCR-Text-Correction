Looking for trouble
Tit c Men and Women Who Curry
Chips on Their Shoulder*
The really unhappy man whose un
bapplness is his own fault is the one
who is foreer carrying "a chip upon
his shoulder/ Perhaps his happiness
is his unhapplness, for when he Is not
engaged in a personal altercation' he is
brooding oer some fancied slight and
awaiting a faorable opportunity to
fcle ent to his wrath '';'•
The man with the chip on his shoul
ttcr is easily recoguize'J, and his society
j by wise people is carefully aoided/ He
j can go nowhere without trouble follow
; ing in his wake If he attends a the
j ater he is either annoyed by the usher
I or some one In the audience or at the
man in the box office for not haing
sold him a seat bought long before he
appeared at tbe window He is the
bane of the car conductor, and on the
railroad train he succeeds in embroiling
himself in a row with the brakeman,
conductor, Pullman car porter and Uhe
passengers , Each flying cinder from
the locomotie is aimed especially at
his eyes, and he succeeds in stirring up
the spirit of mutiny in the hearts of
the traelers ; ,  ,;  r
There are some women similarly con
stituted, who manage to be in trouble
from the moment their eyes open in
the morning till they close them in
sleep These people are indeed to be
pitied, if indeed they are not cordially
hated This quarrelsome habit of mind
can be so fostered that the pctulancy
grows to be a malignant disease and
leads sometimes to the insane asylum
Parents who notice in their children
this fretf ul,  quarreling disposition can
easily find a remedy They may not
agree to the measure— simply a good,
sound thrashing Eery one has beard
of tbe story of the child who was con
tinually whimpering and quarreling
In despair the mother criedPersonal "Are you
sick? What do you want?" Graely
the child answered, "I think, mamma,
I want a whipping" She receied the
whipping, and there was a marked im
proement in her temper— San Fran

waiting for Andrew Lang's "Gray
Fairy Book" But when it was gien
Into her small hands all the wealth of
fairy lore between Its coers was for
a moment forgotten in contemplation
of the coer, a dainty design in gray

SIMPLE FISHER FOLK
THE NEWFOUNLANERS ARE EAS
ILY IMPOSE UPON
A Pathetic and Traffic Incident That
Illustrate* the Attitude of the "Up
per" Clauea— The Hardy Courage
of the Outportera
,;t'St John's, N F, lies by its fish
eries; nothing worth while is produced
Ihere, but, according to the unsophisti
cated stranger, there is a noisy and
ituperatie wrangling oer the wealth
that comes down from the coasts," says
a j writer in the WorWs Work "There
are some few factories, \o be sure, but
they are too ingeniously managed by
half ' For Instance, a certain brand of
tobacco, made at St John's andex
clusiely consumed by fishermen,' Is
sold in the French Island of St Pierre
for half what it costs the Newfound
land i^'bay noddle,', and the manufac
turers pay $15,000 yearly to the pro^
prietor of a rial concern to Induce
him to keep his plant shut down At
St John's, too, is the aristocracy of the
colony— merchants, middlemen, law
yers, physicians, officeholders, tricky
and abusie politicians and colonial
knights (the isitor may obsere on a
signboard aboe a little corner storePersonal
'Sir Thomas Morburn, Grocer Cheap
Teas') There is neither sympathy nor
mercy for the fisherman here, though
there is a most enthusiastic reception
for what he takes from the sea He is
regarded as legitimate prey, is most
marelously lied to before election and
ahused, ridiculed and reiled after
ward But through It all he preseres
a humble faith In 'all those set In au
thority oer him'
"A doctor of the outports— the Inci
dent Is related because, though it may
appear an  extraordinary case, it yet
aptly indicates what has for years
been tbe attitude of the 'upper' classes
toward the fishermen, without whom
Newfoundland would lie waste and
deserted, the shame of the fair earth—
a doctor of the outports was once call
ed to a little white cottage where
three children lay sick of diphtheria
He was the family physician— that Is
to say, the fisherman paid him so
much by the year for medical attend
ance But the injection of antitoxin
is a 'surgical operation' and therefore
not proided for by the annual fee
"'This,' said the doctor, 'will cost
you $2 an injection, John'
" 'Oh, lss, zur!' was the ready reply
'I'll pay you, cur Go on, zur*
" 'But you know my rule, John— no
pay, no work I can't break It for you,
you know, or I'd hae to break it for
half the coast*
" 'Oh, aye I 'Tis all right I wants
un cured I'll pay you when I sells me
fish'
" "But you know my rule, John— cash
down' 
"The fisherman had but $4, no more
Nor could he obtain any more, though
tbe doctor gae him ample time lam
sure that he loed his children dearly,
bur," unfortunately, he had no more
than $4, and there was no other doctor
for fifty miles up and down the coast
" 'Four dollars,' said the doctor, 'two
children Which ones shall It be,
John?'
"Which ones? Why, of course, after
all, the doctor had himself to make the
choice John couldn't So tbe doctor
chose the 'handiest' ones The other
one died
" 'Well,' said John, unresentfully, the
day after the funeral, 'I s'pose a doc
tor hae a right t' be paid for what be
does But' much puzzled, ' 'tis kind o*
queer 1'
"The Newfoundland outporters are
hardy, courageous, boldly adenturous,
simple lied, God fearing, warm heart
ed—a physically splendid race of men
Cowards and weaklings hae for four
hundred years been the unfit of the
place; they occur, of course, in tbe best
regulated families, but do not long sur
ie, for exposure kills off the weak
lings, and in the midst of many dan
gers the cowards lose their lies Chil
dren learn to sail a punt at six or seen
years old, and at eery age they are en
couraged to play at tbe highly danger
ous game (called copying) of prancing
about on floating ice Tbe skill ac
quired in leaping from one sinking
block to another would make tbe
trumpeted rier drier look like a
blundering child As men, they know
their punts as Intimately as a cowboy
knows bis horse, and they will say of
their boats in a gale, 'I thought she'd
not lie through It t'day,' with tbe
same unconcern that a cowboy might
say of his horse, 'He nearly throwed
me that time' The race Is truly hardy
and courageous It waa John Butt,
with a broken collar bone and a spilt
forehead to show for it, who suried
two wild, snowy nights and a day on a
twenty foot ice pan, oer which for
many hours broke great seas, heay
with Jagged fragments of Ice, and it
was a reckless Green bay skipper who
let the wind blow the masts out of his
schooner rather than reef ber, because
be bad been told that his crew thought
him 'nerous'— a mad sort of courage,
to be sure, but proof positie for all
time that he was no coward"

PfT BROW WOMEN
Hard Lot of Female Worker* Abont
EnsUah Coal Mines
Pit brow women are among the most
remarkable women workers in the
world They work as hard as men and
dress almost like them Fie thousand
»f these women find employment In
Lancashire, England, in the coal mines
Their work lies on the pit brow at the
surface and not down below Once wo
men were employed In the coal seams,
but in 1842, in the face of great oppo
sition from colliery owners, an act was
passed prohibiting women and children
from being employed below the surface
in coal mines
At present the duties of the pit brow
women consist in dealing with the coal
as It comes up the shaft to the pit head
When tbe cargo reaches the top they
haul out the wagons, which contain
seeral hundredweight , of coal each,
and run them on the rails to a sort of
tipping machine, which shoots the coal
down below to theTscreen of the* rid"
dllng machine Among the other du
ties of the women is tbe leeling of the
coal on the wagons which receie It as
it drops from the screen
They start work at 6 o'clock In the
morning and finish at 4 In the after
noon They receie 2 shillings or less a
day, and men that do the same work
get 4 shillings Their costume consists
of trousers and clogs and often enough
a cape which has at one time been
worn by a brother When going to
and from work the girls and women
wear petticoats, which they roll up
around tbe waist while engaged on
the pit brow The hair Is closely co
ered with a handkerchief, on top of
which is a soft bonnet
A Valley of eath In Boliia,
 There is a alley in Boliia, South
America, which might well be called
the Valley of the Shadow of eath It
has been Inhabited for an Indefinite
period of years by the Kanaa Indians,
who are kindred to the arious South
American tribes and number now only
a few hundred souls That they were
once a ery powerful tribe is indicated
by the condition of the land which
they as a tribe still Inhabit One can
not trael any distance through their
land without coming upon the old and
forsaken burial grounds of the Kanaa
dead These places cannot be called
graeyards, for the bodies are not
buried, but rather placed upon eleat
ed platforms, wrapped In the garments
of death and bound to the crossbeams
that they may not be displaced
In one of these burial grounds there
will be probably fifty high skeleton
platforms and on each will He from
three to fie of the Kanaa dead The
air In that part of Boliia Is ery pure
and preseratie, for It Is one of the
highest plateaus of the continent, al
though Kanaa alley Is Just a little
below the plateau's height A traeler
passing through that land at night and
by moonlight would be awestricken at

An Affair of Letters
We are much surprised at meeting

"Why, Polly!" we say "How Is It
we find you here?"
"Polly!" she repeats, with a dignity
we neer knew she possessed ','Lady

An apology on our part establishes
friendly relations once more, and she
tells us that she really has won and
wedded Lord Oledebts and that her fa
ther's dollars are being expended in the
refurbishing of the Oledebts castle
"But," we say, "It was rumored In
Bowersille that you were hesitating
in your choice between three honest
farmer lads in the icinity How was
it, then, that you married his lordship?"
"Oh," she titters, "he came to Bow

first time?"
"She said If there wasn't another
man in the world but me she wouldn't
marry me"
"That was pretty strong What did
she say the second time?"
"She said she liked me pretty well,
but she couldn't think of marrying me,
for she might see some one she liked
better"
"Humph! And tbe third time?"
"Tbe third time she asked me if I
wanted to tease the life out of her"

A Trick In Letter Writing
"If you f>re compelled to write a let

Ink in the house blow your breath on
the page after it has been written,"
said a woman who eidently had tried
tbe experiment "It will preent blur

It moistens tbe graphite and makes it
adhere more closely to the paper Of
course you c^n make it blur by rub

will be as legible as If they had been
written in ink"— New York Press

In making nearly eery room occupied

In uniform; it makes them too con
spicuous Uniforms for use in the de

Hasting* and Tilden
Hugh Hastings, when editor of the
New York Commercial Adertiser, was
Incessant in bitter attacks upon Samuel
J Tilden One day he receied a let
ter, from Henry F Spauldlng, then
president of the Central Trust com
pany, to the effect that his  attacks
upon Mr Tilden appeared unwarrant
ed, and unless he could gie some sat
isfactory explanation Mr Spauldlng
would discontinue taking the Commer

Mr Hastings replied, "When I was
a clerk in Albany Sam Tilden was
known as the boy who sold grated tur
nips for horse radish, and he has been
doing it eer since" •

UNER FALSE PRETENSES
\ The Amador Ledger was the only
objector at the time in the whole coun
ty, but during all this time it did not
once charge that the law was uncon
stitutional
The aboe appears in an article
published in our cotemporaries
under the signature of W L Rose,
justice of Sutter Creek It relates
of course to the bill proiding a sal
ary for township officers It seems
that the mantle of defender of the
noappeal, stopwhereyouare policy
has fallen upon the officials inter
ested The same statement has
been published, before, that the ob
jections on constitutional grounds
to the salary bill were an after
thought as far as the Ledger is con
cerned;' that no such, objections
were raised at the time the bill was
pending before the legislature We
hae not troubled ourself to correct
these statements heretofore, inas
much as it makes not the slightest
difference to the merits of the case
whether the alleged conflict with the
constitution was raised before or
after the bill was passed by the law
makers Silence seems to embolden
these adocates in their policy of
falsehood Mr Rose and others
who hae been writing on this sub
ject ought at least to look up what
the Ledger has said on this question
while the bill was before the legis
lature, before enturing to make
haphazard assertions The Ledger
of Feb 27, 1902, in an editorial dis
cussing the subject at some length,
contains the followingPersonal
In the eent of this salary bill be
coming law, the question is being asked
when will it become operatie The
act itself says it shall go into effect im
mediately; that statement, howeer,
does not oerride constitutional pro
isions No doubt the bill has been
engineered with the iew of helping
present officials The plain language
of the constitution sets up a barrier to
its application to present incumbents
Section 9 of Article XXI readsPersonal
The compensation of any county,
city, town, or municipal officer, shall
not be increased after his election, or
during his term of office
In the face of this, it is mere quib
bling to raise the question of whether
or not the proposed law would be an in
crease of compensation Increased pay
was the ery object of the measure
They are not paid enough under the
existing law; the proposed law is to
remedy this condition
The constitution says this cannot be
done as far as those now in office are
concerned
PROPOSE INCREASE OF ASSESS
MENT
County Clerk C h Culbert has
receied a notice from the state
board of equalization citing Amador
county to appear before a meeting
of that board to be held in Sacra
mento on Saturday, September 5, to
show cause why the assessment roll
of this county should not be raised
With the assessment roll as return
ed by the county assessor showing
an increased aluation oer last year
of nearly $300,000, this proposed ad
ditional increase is somewhat in the
nature of a surprise party We do
not know on what grounds the as
sessment roll was raised this year
It cannot be seriously questioned
that property alues throughout
Amador county hae suffered a seri
ous decline during the past year
Around Jackson the decline is fully
onethird In Sutter Creek the de
preciation is probably still more
noticeable It is useless to discuss
the causes of this decline Labor
agitation is one of the prime factors,
but not the only factor In face of
reduced income, it is hard to be
handicapped with extra assessment
The proposition to add to the injus
tice by a horizontal increase from
the state board, should be resisted
to the utmost The fact is Amador
county, under present conditions, is
in a position to ask for a reduction
instead of submitting to a raise
There will be no regular meeting of
the board of superisors before the
date set for the hearing on the pro
posed increase Some official action
should be taken howeer, to present
the situation fairly before the state
board, so as to preent the carry
ing out of this plan to oppress the
property interests of the county A
special meeting should be called if
necessary to take action on this
matter Citizens may go down in a
priate capacity, in opposition, but
this is hardly sufficient Some par
ties clothed with authority to speak
in behalf of the goerning body of
the county should be present to ex
plain the facts as they exist, and to
demand a reduction instead of an in
crease It is patent to eery think
ing person that the exigencies of
the goernment, both state and
local, are such as to demand more
money for their maintenance eery
year To offset this tendency, and
to aoid the alternatie of increas
ing the tax rate, the policy is adopt
ed of tryig to swell the assessment
roll To the taxpayer, howeer,
the practical result is precisely Personal the
same "Whether the assessment roll
shall be higher," with the tax rate
the same, or whether the tax rate
shall be the same as last year, with
the assessed alue inflated is a mat
ter of little moment He is called
upon to pay more in either eent
It is simply the difference between
tweedledee and tweedledum When
the assessment alue has already
been swelled to the limit, it is cer
tainly in order to raise a igorous
protest against a second boost dur
ing the same year* j
The editorial superision of our
cotemporaries on the justice's salary
case has assumed a new phase It
is now relegated to the department
of correspondence, with W L Rose,
the local justice of Sutter Creek,
footing the same with his own sig
nature We are gratified to be'able
to report this progress toward
straightforward journalism The
justice is seemingly ery much in
faor of enforcing the law The ad
ocates of no appeal hae finally
eered round to the same iew as
the Ledger on this proposition The
district attorney and the county
clerk are no doubt just as anxious
to hae the law respected and en
forced as is W L Rose The only
difference appears to be that the
county officers want to find out
exactly what the law is before going
ahead, while our respected township
officer wants them to pay up first,
and find out where they are at after
ward The gulf between these two
propositions is simply the difference
between the right and wrong way of
doing a thing It is uphill work to
conince an intelligent public that
it is contrary to law to test the con
stitutionality of a law before the su
preme court Furthermore, it is an
equally arduous task to show that a
law, the constitutionality of which
is in process of being tested, should
be enforced while the appeal is pend
ing The ery object of the appeal
is to discoer whether the law is a
ital one or merely a dead letter
The Ledger cheerfully concedes that
the justices and constables are en
titled to pay under the salary bill if
that law receies the seal of ap
proal from the supreme court We
would then be found just as earnest
ly contending for their side of the
question, as we now are in urging a
definite settlement of the matter by
the higher court  If the law passes
the final roll call well and good, the
property holders may still regard it
as an unwise law, but they will at
once say that the township officers
are then entitled to all benefits pio
ided thereunder At the same time,
the necessity of an amendment to
the constitution to preent a re
currence of such snags in the future
will be made plain
The outlook for the coming State
Fair is that there will be a larger
number of exhibits that will be of
interest to the general public,
whether dwellers in the city or coun
try, than has been the case for a
number of years past, and that both
old and young will find plenty to
amuse as well as instruct them at
the Pailion, as well as the fine ex
hibit of liestock at the track

SLICKENS AGAIN
The Stockton Chamber of Com
merce at a meeting held this week,
referred the matter of the pollution
of the Mokelumne rier by slickeus
from the copper mines to the state
fish and game commissioners, with
a request that they take action
thereo It is useless to deny that
the silt from quartz and copper
mines is injurious to fish The deni
zens of the water cannot lie in
streams which receie mill tailings
in quantity Below the Gwin mine,
from whence hundreds of tons of
tailings are discharged daily, fishing
in the Mokelumne rier is not good
like it'used to be when, the mining
industry was at a standstill along
the borders of that stream It is
useless to deny the fact that gold or
copper mining along the banks of a
rier is incompatible with fish cul
ture This is well recognized in all
districts where mining is conducted
on a largescale, whether quartz or
placer The Stockton Chamber of
Oommerce don't wish to injure the
mining industry; at the same time
it don't want the fish carryiug
capacity of the Mokelumne rier to
be interfered with Tt suggests that
restraining dams can be constructed
at small expense so as to keep the
injurious matter from the rier It
is easy to make such a statement; it
is quite another thing to proe it
The truth is any attempt to enforce
a demand to impound quartz tailings
would impart a deathblow to the
quartz mining interests of the
mother lode The extra cost thereby
entailed upon the mine owners would
be absolutely prohibitory To take
care of hundreds of tous of tailings
mixed with more than double its
weight in water, daily, is a task by
no means easy Indeed,  there is
not a mine in this county, nor in the
neighboring county of Calaeras,
that could hope to continue in busi
ness under such an additional ex
pense The mining industry has all
the burden it can bear at present,
without the addition of this "last
straw" of impounding slickens
ECLARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL
Judge Church, of the superior
court of Fresno county, has just ren
dered a decision which bears directly
on the justice's salary case now pend
ing in Amador county The Fresno
court holds that the amendments of
1901 to the county goernment act
regulating the compensation of town
ship officers in that county are in io
lation of the constitutional require
ment that laws be uniform in their
operation The legislature in 1901
passed for Fresno county a similar
bill to that which the last legislature
passed for Amador county in regard
to compensation of township officers
By this bill the townships of that
county were classified according to
population for the purpose of fixing
the compensation of township of
ficers It proided that in town
ships haing a population of 6000 or
oer a justice of the peace might re
ceie as fees in criminal cases not to
exceed $140 per month, while in
townships haing less than 6000 in
habitants the fees of the justice were
limited to $90 per month It does
not appear that the lawmakers at
tempted to make this bill applicable
to incumbents in office at the time
of its passage, so that it was not
open to the constitutional objection
raised in the Amador case that it
increased the compensation of of
ficials after their election and dur
ing their term of office It was op
posed, howeer, on the ground that
it was special legislation, and also
that it was not uniform in its opera
tion On this point the court saysPersonal
Our supreme court has repeatedly
held that the meaning of this constitu
tional requirement that a general law
shall be uniform in its operation is to
forbid the legislature from granting to
any citizen or class of citizens, rights,
priileges or immunities, which upon
the same terms shall not equally be
long to all By the express terms of
the proision of tho act under reiew
the legislature in effect says to one jus
tice of the peace in this countyPersonal "For
the trial of 40 criminal actions in one
month you shall receie $120, while it
trrants to another justice of the county
for the trial of the same number of
cases the right to receie only $90"
It is difficult to conceie a more flagrant
iolation of the rule of uniformity
This Fresno opinion seems to be
squarely in conflict with the opinion
of Judge Rust in this county If the
question were carried no further
than the trial court, we should hae
one rule of interpretation preail
ing in Amador, and an exactly con
tradictory interpretation preailing
in Fresno That is the sort of
anomaly our local justices are con
tending for County officials, how
eer, do not propose to sanction
such a policy of "confusion worse
confounded" They recognize thkt
the supreme court is the proper tsi
bunal for the final settlement of sujh
conflicting opiu ions; and propose to
go there, notwithstanding the wig
gling and wailing that has been and
is still being done to slay the march
of the case to that desirable goal

A Just Recognition
George Wriggle6wortb, one of the
engineers of the Keystone mine, who
was crowded out of his long and faith
ful serice for that company because of
his refusal to join the union of the
Western Federationilast week, has se
cured employment as engineer at the
Bunker Hill mine, only a short distance
from the scene of his Iformer employ
ment Wrigglesworth ia the eteran
engineer of Amador county For oer
thirty years he has been continuously
in harness at the Keystone, and his
career in this responsible position was
unmarked by Personal an, accident Such a
record is somothing to be proud of
He knew his engine like a book Eery
foot of the cable indicated to his trained
mind the whereabout of the skip io
the shaft He was eer alert and
watchful, and the underground toilers
knew that with Wrigglesworth at the
leer they were as safe as human skill
and forethought could insure them
Before he went to the Keystone, Wrig
glesworth was engineer at the Amador
Consolidated in Sutter Creek in 1871,
at tho time of the great strike, and his
course in standing firmly by his trust at
that time was in keeping with his con
duct eer since It was not to be sup
posed that one so thoroughly ersed in
his calling would be idle for any length
of time Men of his stump are not to
be secured eery day We understand
that all the hands, fie or six in num
ber, who left the Keystone last week,
hae found employment at other mines
in the county
Special Meeting
A special session of the board of
superisors has been called to meet in
Jackson next Monday for the purpose
of taking some action to offset the pro
posed increase of the assessed aluation
of property in Amador county by the
state board of equalization The super
isors are all dead set against the con
templated raise, as being entirely un
warranted under existing conditions
Representaties will be ! authorized to
appear before the state board at the
hearing on the sth of September, and
show that property is assessed at a
higher aluation in this county than at
any preious year We understand
that the principal reason why the as
sessment roll was boosted up nearly
$300,000 by the, county assessor, was
because of 4he determination of the
state equalizers to secure a material
uplifting of aluations Assessor Mar
chant was aware that unless some
showing was made, the state board
would step in and perform the boosting
act A ten per cent jump would
amount to considerably more than the
increase made by the county assessor,
and the local officer was led to enhanced
aluation in a great measure to ward
off this greater raise that loomed up
before the county It is probable that
Assessor J, Marchant and County Clerk
C L Culbert, who are both thoroughly
acquainted with property alues and
the condition of the county at present,
will attend the ' hearing of Amador
county before the state equalizers
Coal s Wood
The county buildings are laying in
their supply of fuel for the winter At
the county hospital superintendent
Barrett is putting in practice a scheme
to economize on the fuel bills heretofore
contracted by that institution He ex
perimented with Jackson alley coal
last winter and was coninced that by
burning coal be could effect a material
saing to the county He is now get
ting in 40 tons of this coal About half
the usual quantity of wood will be taken
as a precautionary measure He be
liees that a ton of coal will do the
same serice as a cord of wood As
the Jackson alley fuel is deliered at
the hospital at $4 per ton, while oak
wood costs $6 per cord, it means a sa
ing of onethird in the cost of fuel
Should this trial proe satisfactory,
coal will be substituted exclusiely in
place of wood hereafter

THE AMAOB LEGER; JACKSOK, CALIFORNIA, FRIAY, AUGUST 28, 1903
welling Burned
A mysterious fire occurred on the
grounds of the Oneida mine on Friday
night, August 21, by which the dwell
ing house occupied by H H Hurlbert,
the bead machinist of the company,
was totally destroyed, with nearly all
its contents The fire was discoered
about midnight, and it started from
the outside, but how it originated no
one knows Two persons were asleep
on the premises, Mr Hurlbert and his
son, who is also employed about the
works Mrs Hurlbert has been away
from home on a summer acation for
seeral weeks, and no fire had been
lighted on the premises for some time,
as the inmates were boarding outside
Mr Hurlbert was awakened by the
barking of a small dog that was ' kept
about the place The antics of the
faithful canine were so unusual that he
was coninced something was amiss,
and the glare of flames showed that
there was no time for delay He arose
hastily, and awoke his son They were
only just in time to make their escape,
grabbicg an armful of clothing as they
did so All the furniture was destroy
ed with the building, except a sewing
machine and one or two other articles
The little dog that was instrumental in
giing the alarm perished in the flames
He saed others, but himself he could
not sae The house stood alone, and
while ' the intense heat of the large
frame building threatened _to spread
the fire to the nearest dwelling, the
prompt assistance managed to aert
this dangerPersonal *
The dwelling  was owned by the
Oneida company, Mr Hurlbert being
a renter It was insured for about half
its alue The loss Including furniture
Is estimated at oer $1000
The affair is shrowded in mystery,
and has gien birth to a good deal of
talk The hour, and indeed all the
circumstances surrounding the case are
such as to awaken suspicion No doubt
the authorities will make a thorough
inestigation

A Bemarkable Summer
The coolness of the summer so far is
a matter of general comment While
the unusually genial weather has been
satisfactory from the standpoint of
personal conenience, it has not been
without its drawbacks The fruit men
are complaining that the fruit is not
maturing, especially grapes Some
seasonable hot days are essential to the
timely ripening of the fruit Grapes
are a couple of weeks backward this
year In the mountains the stockmen
are complaining at the shortness of the
season and the scarcity of feed Some
stockmen are driing their cattle out
already The ranges are becoming
oerstocked, and in addition this year
the spring rains were rather scanty,
which has told adersely to the inter
ests of the cattlemen

MINING ALONG THE
MOTHER LOE
Closing own of the Famous TJtica
Mine at Angels —Bonding Claims
Around Jackson
Bctte Basin— After working a few
days on the Butte basin grael claim,
operations were suspended on account
of the flow of water being too strong to
control with the crude machinery at
hand'
Argonaut — Large quantities of
supplies are being receied at this mine
It is the intention to put the property
in shape to start up, so that if the out
look justifies the mine will be prepared
to resume operations in a short time
It will take mouth= li jeer, to get it
in shape Whether it will commence
operations wben it gets in condition to
do so will depend entirely upon the
labor outlook at that time
Bonding Mining Claims— G N
Wright of New York, has been around
Jackson for seeral days, for the pur
pose of bonding mining claims along
the main belt, with the iew of inter
esting New" York capitalists therein
He says that there are millions of dol
lars in the east seeking inestment It
is useleps to go there with a small
proposition, such as a single mining
claim They would not entertain it
for a moment' But by combining many
claims under bond at the disposal of
one man or company, they are more
likely to take hold He is trying to se
cure bonds on mining land, whether
under agricultural or mineral title,
from Jackson toward the rier A
number of owners hae displayed a
willingness to enter into an agreement
His proposition is to secure contracts,
making a j first payment due in six
months, and the balance in monthly
instalments With these secured, he
proposes to lay the matter before New
York men, and form a syndicate to
work the same
Utica Closed— The Utica mine at
Angels Camp is a thing of the past As
a gold producer its history has been
closed It was the first mine of Angels,
and made the town famous For many
years it held tho pride of place as the
greatest producer in Calaeras county;
its total output a of gold runs up into
many millions, j For a time its monthly
yield was in the neighborhood of $100,
000, making it at that time the richest
gold producer in the state The ore
body became poorer in gold bearing
qualities with increasing depth,; while
the cost of operating became greater,
until the point was reached when profit
disappeared It is one of the ery few
instances in the state of a mine, being
abandoned because of the diminution
of the gold in the rock after a long
diidendpaying career By its sus
pension 200 miners hae been thrown
out of employment, representing about
onefourth of the underground workers
of this famous camp

many engineers and surface employees,
not members of the W F M at all, to
quit work and thus aid the Jackson
Union in winning its strike The min
ing companies conceded 9 hours labor
underground instead of ten It was
agreed all around there should be no
discrimination, and work was resumed ;
the engineers and surface men getting
no benefit whateer, but many of us
losing two or three weeks' work
At this time many members of the
W F M openly stated that they did
not want anyone but miners to belong
to their union Later the unions post
ed notices that all who did not join
would be treated and published as
scabs Thereupon the engineers and
mechanics organized themseles into a
union of the International Steam ' En
gineers, affiliated with the American
Federation of La"bor We had granted
to us a regular charter from the su
preme council, and a duly appointed
organizer came here from San Fran
cisco and properly installed our union
The charge that we are or eer hae
been opposed to the W F M, or wish
in any way to antagonize it, or organ
ized at the request of the mining com
panies is absolutely I and unqualifiedly
false We organized for self protection;
we did not wish to be drien from out
work for the sole benefit of others; we
belonged to a separate craft from the
miners and want to fight our own bat
tles and attend to our business without
outside interference We are Ameri
can citizens, and only ask our Ameri
can rights to be permitted to work,
support our families, and educate our
children We hae no grieance
against our employers, and are satisfied
with our hours, wages, and conditions
We hae now been organized oer three
months, hold regular meetings in Sut
ter Creek,' and hae a grpwlUff mem
bership of oer 100
Seeral weeks ago a committee from
the Amador Uuion, W F M, No 135,
demanded that our members working
in that district join the W F M or
quit their work The demand was re
fused Thereupon a diligent effort was
made by this union to procure the dis
charge of these men,
The Fremont, Bunker Hill and Key
stone companies, all assured our mem
bers that they could join or not join
any union, lodge or party they desired;
that pursuant to the strike settlement
there was to be no discrimination The
Fremont aqd Bunker Hill companies
kept their promise, but Mr Jasper M
Mconald, Mills Building, and a Park
Commissioner of San Francisco, on last
Thursday discharged his three en
gineers at the Keystone, Messrs Gray,
Wrigglesworth, Tretbeway and Botto,
members of our union, for the sole
reason that they would not join the W
F M The work of these engineers
was satisfactory, and they were old,
faithful employees of the company, one
of them haing sered the Keystone
Company 33 years, yet Mr Mconald
forced these men put of their work
They hae lied in Amador for years,
are respected members of that com
munity, hae families and own their
homes in that town Mr Mconald
assured and promised them directly
and indirectly, orally and ;in writing",
that he would not discharge them for
refusing to join the W F M This
same man, Jasper M Mconald, runs
a company store at Amador andforces
all his employees at the Keystone mine
to trade there, and has done so for
years It is the only company store in
this whole mining district We sub
mit to the public that Mr Mconald is
not a man of his word, he is unfair, un
ust, unAmerican
The AnthracitePersonal Coal Commission
made this finding r i
"It is adjudged End awarded that no
>erson shall be refused employment or
in any way discriminated against on
account of membership or nonmember
ship in any labor organization, and that
there shall be no discrimination or in
terference with any employee who is
not a member of any labor organization
by members of such organization "
This finding has been approed by
the press and the people of the whole
country, yet it remained for Mr Jasper
M Mconald, Park Commissioner of
San Francisco, to discharge three faith
ful employees because of a demand from
a labor organization of which he was
afraid

THE LARGER FOOT
See if This Shoe Salesman's Theory
Fits Yonr Case
"The question of which foot to fit
first is an important one to us," said the
shoe salesman "It may seem strange t<j
you, but it is rarely that we do not ex
perience some trouble in fitting one
foot while the other is easily coered
A popular belielJjbtalus that the left
foot of eery person Is the hardest to
fit, nd consequently many shoe clerks
always try a shoe on that foot first It
Is not true, howeer, according to my
obseration, that there Is any inflexible
rule as to which foot to try first It is
true, neertheless, that in a majority
of cases If you succeed in fitting the left
foot you will hae no trouble with the
right My practice is to try both feet
before I pronounce a pair of shoes a
perfect fit Then lam sure of aoiding
any mistake growing out of peculiar
ities of  foot formation  No two per
sons hae feet formed exactly alike,
and the shoe salesman who thinks so
and is goerned accordingly will meet
with many complaints
"For some time I pondered oer the
problem of fitting shoes to feet, and es
pecially as to why the left foot should
be considered ttje ' standard by which
to be goerned The only rational the
ory I hae eer been able to eole is
a ery simple one when you come to
consider It Nine out of ten persons
you meet are right handed, as we say
About one person In ten, or perhaps the
per cent Is een less than that, uses his
left hand If you will obsere persons
who use the right hand when they are
standing and talking 'they inariably
rest their weight on the left foot And,
ice ersa, a left handed person will
rest his or her weight on the right foot
The result Is that with right handed
persons the left foot is probably a frac
tion larger than the right foot, and the
shoe clerk must Ineitably find this to
be a fact sooner or later" — New Or

ROMANCE IN VARIE GUISE
efinition of the Word Is Bnsceptlble
of Wide iersification
What is romance? ~ Een the collo
quial use of the term is aried  When
we say "you are romancing'? or call
anything romantic as distinguished
from what is real or what is true we
mean one thing, but quite another
when we apply the term romantic to
natural scenery And in this applica
tion we must distinguish between the
effect upon us of that which we call
romantic because of human associa
tions with certain sights or sounds and
that wildncss of nature which we call
romantic because of its absolute dis
sociation from anything human
Keeping out of mind the use of the
word in artistic and literary criticism,
let us try to find what element of
reconcilement there is in the diersities
of colloquial usage  •  
In all that is generally called ro
mantic in  the cases aboe mentioned
there Is the common element of
strangeness We easily reert to what
must hae been the original sense of
the word in its connection with those
mediaeal modifications of the Latin
tongue known as the romance lan
guages The Saxon or Celt would
hae found his natie tongue sufficient
for all ordinary needs, but If he
caught the Roman air in any way, by
trael or refinement of taste and habit,
he would, to meet the newly deeloped
need, borrow the graces of the Roman
speech — that is, he would romance —

Rockefeller and the Bung*
In former years John  Rockefel
ler's superision of Standard Oil com
pany affairs took in een the smallest
detail On one occasion, according to
Ida M Tarbell in McOlure's, com
menting on a monthly statement, he
called a refiner's attention to a dis
crepancy in regard to bungs, articles
worth about as much In a refinery as
pins are in a household "Last month,"
he said to the subordinate official con
cerned, "you reported on hand 1,119
bungs Ten thousand were sent you
at the beginning of this month You
hae used 9,527 this month You re

EMERSON'S PROSETSTYLE
Held to Be Locking In the Quality
of Writer* Called Masters
What shall be said of Emerson's
prose? Was Matthew Arnold right
when, as an experienced critic calmly
judging the faorite author of his
youth, he denied that the "Essays,"
the lectures and "English Traits" form
ed a body of prose of sufficient merit
to entitle Emerson to be ranked as a
great man of letters? It seems as if
the time had come for Emerson's coun
trymen frankly to accept this erdict
Because of deficiencies, both of style
and of romance, Emerson does not
belong to the small class of the great
masters of prose His style, despite
the fact that "Nature" and many of
the essays contain pages of eloquent
prose almost equal in power and beau
ty to noble poetry, was nearly alwayr
that of the lecturer or preacher rather
than that of the writer He too fre
quently lost the note of distinction and
was content if he satisfied his far from
exigent audiences In diction, to be
sure, he was a conscious and consum
mate master, and It need scarcely be
said that few writers hae surpassed
him in the ability to compose a preg
nant sentence But as is generally ad
mitted and as is shown by his prac
tice of piecing his notes together, he
was rarely able to eole a paragraph,
much more a whole essay, in a mas
terly or een In a workmanlike fashion
It may be granted that critics hae
oeremphasized his lack of coherence,
that there is more logical unity In his
essays than appears on first reading,
that "English Traits" and the later
olumes are far \ from being mere
strings of "orphic sayings," but the
fact seems to remain that the prose
style of Emerson from first to last
lacks the firmness, the compass, the
precision, the flexibility, the Indiid
uality we demand of the prose writers
whom we denominate masters — Pro
fessor Trent In Bookman
MIGHTY TREES OF SIERRA
Greatest In Sise of All Creations of
the Liing; World
uring all the ages nature has fa
ored the growth of forests on the Pa
cific mountains, proiding the peculiar
conditions which make them far differ
ent from, greater In size, more luxuri
ant, than any other in the world Of
all the creations of the liing world
none is so great in size, so majestic in
presence, as the mighty trees of the
Sierra and the Cascades For here the
air is always fertile with moisture,
clouds blown in from the Pacific ocean
rest among the mountain summits, een
crowning the tops of the trees them
seles, and here discharge their rain 1
The soil is deep and spongy with cen
turies of decomposing egetable matter,
furnishing an' unequaled nurturing
place for egetation, and there are no
extremes of heat in summer or depths
of cold In winter, says the Century
Magazine
Eery condition has been faorable
to unexampled exuberance of growth
not only of the largest trees, but of all
manner of undergrowth, ine, shrub
and brake A huge tree falls, decays
and is yellowed with thick moss Im
mediately scores of young firs and ce
dars spring up along the top of it— the
first chance of a bare spot In the wood
Old burned stumps, gathering soil In
their hollow Interiors, aw nurseries for
colonies of young trees, some strong
Indiidual finally shouldering out the
others, growing larger, and, as the
mother stump drops away, sending Its
roots downward into the earth through
the disintegrating textures until it in
time becomes a great tree 
Women* Strength i n Tears
The weakest woman in all the world
Is armed with one weapon against
which man's pride and strength are
powerless Her tears will win when
eerything else has failed A woman's
tears moe her own tender sex' as well
as the sterner masculine brutes Old
and young yield to their potential
spell, and when the woman happens to
be pretty there is no telling what will
follow when her bright eyes grow
misty with these messengers from a
wounded heart It Is folly to attempt
to Ptniul out nßalust a woman's tears
They hae caused reolutions They
hae made and unmade many a great

"We are here today," said the solemn

GUARIAN CRANES
They Take the Place of Shepherd

The naties of Venezuela and ad
Joining countries on the north side of
the rier Amazon often aail them
seles of the serices of a natie crane
to care for their poultry and also, in
the place of collies or shepherd dogs, to
guard and herd their domestic animals
This remarkable bird, which the In
dians call yakamik, and the ornitholo
gists Psophia crepltans, is found in a
wild state in the great forests which
lie between the northern coasts of
South America and the Amazon rier,
particularly in Venezuela and British
Guiana The birds neer leae the for

be trusted with the care of a flock of
sheep or' domestic fowls and eery
morning 'will drie the ducks and poul
try to their feeding places and, care
fully collecting any stragglers, bring
them safely home at night A yakamik
soon learns to know and obey the oice
of Its master, follows him, when per
mitted, whereer he goes and appears
delighted at receiing his caresses
It pines at his absence and welcomes
his return and is extremely jealous of
any rial Should any dog or cat ap
proach it flies at it with the utmost
fury and, attacking It with wing and
beak, dries it away It presents itself
regularly during meals, from which it
chases all domestic animals and een
the negroes who wait on the table if It
Is not well acquainted with them, and
only asks for a share of the eatables
after it has drien away all who might
aspire to a faorable notice from the
family— Brooklyn Eagle    na
A Long ance
William Kemp, an English comic ac
tor who flourished during the last years
of Queen Elizabeth and who belonged
to the same company as Shakespeare
and "created" ogberry, danced from
London to Norwich, a distance of 114
miles He was accompanied by a ser
ant, an umpire and a man with a tabor
and pipe Crowds hindered his start
on Feb 11, 1600, and many met him at
eery place Seeral tried to dance
with him, but none could rial his pace
The most successful were women   Al
though delayed by a snowstorm, he did
it In nine days, and on the way accept
ed a challenge or two, each time com
ing off best,' except when a Chelmsford
maiden of fourteen danced till he was
ready to lie down" On his return he
wrote an account ofit, which 1 ends
with a warning to those with whom he
had made wagers that If they, did not
pay up he would publish their names

runs, Is a merry, readable pamphlet

is the statement that the customary
way to deal with pickpockets at the

No Langaiitre of Their Own
Among the peoples of the world the
Swiss are alone In haing no language
they can call their own According to
a recent isitor to the little country,
about  threefourths of the people of
Switzerland speak German, while the
remainder diide four other languages
among them, mainly French and Ital
ian, the languages arying as a rule
according to the proximity of the peo
ple to each country whose tongue they
speak Public documents and notices
are printed In both French and Ger
man
In the Swiss congress, or national
parliament, the members make their
speeches either in French or German,
for nearly all the members understand
both languages The orders of the pres
ident are translated by an official in
