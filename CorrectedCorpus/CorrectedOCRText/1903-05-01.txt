INGENIOUS TORTUREB
Craeltlea of Panlahnirnt Inflicted o»
Offenders In Morocco
In Morocco the torture of offenders,
real and suspected, has been and is
Btlll much practiced Much ingenuity
is shown In the infliction of pain— such
deices as the rubbing of red pepper in
to the eyeballs, tying np the wrists at
a height from the ground, etc
At the death of the late sultan a pre
tender proclaimed himself the rightful
heir to the throne and had a certain
success When presently oercome by
the legitimate authorities, he was
seised, thrown down, when chillies
were applied to the inside of his mouth
till It swelled with pain, and he was
desired to shout out his titles and qual
ities as much as be pleased, being of
course unable to utter a word After
that be was thrown into Jail to rot there
till he died
A refinement of cruelty Is the torture
of the "iron gloe," as it is called A
lump of quicklime is placed in a man'B
hand, which Is closed up 'lnto a fist
Then the flat is tightly  bound with
leather thongs and plunged Into a tub
of cold water
• The agony soon becomes extreme
The torture is continued for eight or
ten days until in the end mortification
ensues and probably death Again, a
form of "lying up" is to chain or fasten
a man to a wall, with his arms extend
ed so that he can only escape strangu
lation by standing on tiptoe— Kansas
City Independent
A Ral'i Teeth
The rat Is remarkably well equipped
for the peculiar life he Is ordained to
lead He has strong weapons la the
shape of four long and ery sharp
teeth— two In the npper Jaw and two
in the lower These teeth are wedge
shaped and by a wonderful proision
of nature hae always a fine, sharp
cutting edge On examining them care
fully the Inner part Is found to be of a
soft, loryllke composition, which can
easily be worn away, and the outside
is composed of a glassllke enamel
which Is exceedingly hard
The upper teeth work into the under
so that the centers of the opposed teeth
meet perfectly hi the act of gnawing;
hence the soft part is being continually
worn away, while the hard pnrt keepa
a hard, chlselIlke edge all the time, and
at the same time the teeth are con
stantly growing up from the bottom, so
that as they wear away a fresh supply
is ready Should one of these teeth be
remoed by accident or otherwise, the
opposing tooth will continue to grow,
and there* being nothing to wear It
away it will project from the mouth
and be turned upon Itself, and if Jt be
an under tooth it will often grow bo
long as to penetrate the skull
Undertaker*

James I The three chief undertakers
of 1614 were Lords Bacon, Somerset
and Neille They undertook to bribe
the chief speakers and men of influ
ence in parliament that year oer to
the side of the king, with but partial
Biiccess Then there were undertakers
In Ireland in 1008 They were English
and Scotch colonists sent to north Ire
land and were each allotted 2,000 acres
of land They were men of capital and
undertook to pay a mark a year for
eery six acres and to admit no recu
sant for tenants Hence the name as
applied to them But neither the his
tories nor the dictionaries gie any rea
son for calling the men who bury our
dead undertakers

BOER LANGUAGES
The ifferent Klnda o ntch Spoken
In Sonth Africa ,^ 
It seems a strange thing to say, but
there are " three 1 utch' j languages In
South Africa The earliest utch set
tlers at the Cape were largely utch
sailors and others belonging to the low
er orders of Amsterdam, Rotterdam
and other utch seaports Their lan
guage was a low utch" dialect to bfr^
gin with, and although the sprinkling
of utch officers at the Cape their
best to presere the lnngtsige of the
Netherlands they, couiil ; not preent
the dialect of the settlers from  still
further degenerating Into a mere collo
quial, patois Its degeneration was
doubthsM largely brought about by do
mestic serants and slaes—Hotten
tots, Malays and Mozambique ICalUrs—
who spoke it ery Imperfectly and in
troduced into it mfiy strange words
and idioms This, then, is the genesis
of what Is ariously known as "Cape
utch," "Kitchen utch," "Patriot
utch," "Afrikaans" and "Afrikander
Taal" Its basis Is utch, but the
nouns hae lost their declensions and
the erbs their conjugations, while
grammatical gender and syntax gener
ally hae gone by the board To the
educated Hollander of today it Is a lit
erary atrocity, and he cannot away
with it, but to the Afrikander it is his
mother tongue, the language of his
home and his childhood, the exponent
of all that he knows of humor and
pathos It is full of expressie idioms,
pithy proerbs and pawky expressions,
like those so dear to the lowland Scot,
and yet It is not a language, for it has
no literature
The second of the three utch lan
guages referred to might be called "ec
clesiastical utch," or, if you like, Af
rican utch It is the language of Hol
land as that language was ; written
about 200 years ago It is the language
of the utch Bible and ery much re
sembles our, own authorized ersion in
its simplicity  and directness of style
It Is the language of the utch psalm
and Gesang books and of the deotion
al works of old utch diines, which
make up', the balance of the utch
farmers' literature" In it are also writ
ten many tracts and a few deotional
works by liing ministers of the utch
Reformed church To the Boer where
er you find him it is the language of
his church and of his religion This is
the utch language which the leaders
of the utch Afrikander party are de
termined to presere It Isiieer epo
ken by Afrikanders among themseles,
howeer, and it Is neer written gnun
matically by them In their correspond
ence The Boer has no fear that his
"Hulstaal," Cope utch, will die out,
but fears that his children will forget
or neglect to learn the language of his
church and of his forefathers
The third utch language might be
called modern literary or "high utch"
— that""* 1 ''
"spoken by educated Hollanders of to
day It is florid, Inoled in construc
tion and ery artificial in style as com
pared with the language of the utch
Bible  Its pronunciation has also
changed considerably In the interal,
and een an educated utch speaking
Afrikander listening to a oluble Hol
lander can hardly make head or tail
of what he is saying — Scotsman
A Legend About Cat*
The ancient Greeks thought that all
creatures except cats had souls and
that that animal lost Its soul through a
bargain made between a bridge archi
tect and the deil The architect had
besought the deil to get his help in
constructing an exceedingly dangerous
bridge structure, and his Satanic maj
esty only consented to lend aid on con
dition that the first creature to cross It
should lose its soul
This was agreed upon, the bridge
finished in due time and the deil sent
to the opposite aide to await his prey
The shrewd architect took good care to
send a cat oer before any human be
ing was allowed to cross On learning
of the bargain the cat recrossed the
bridge and scratched the architect's
eyes out
Naming a Town
According to a local tradition, proba
bly Inented, Sayille, N V, receied
its name In a peculiar fashion The
settlers were gathered In debate upon
the shore, trying to agree upon a name
for the place, and one after another
proposed his suggestion with, "Say,
how '11 this do?" After many sugges
tions had been rejected some one bar
ren of imagination but sensitie of ear
proposed that the oft repeated word
"Say" be made the first syllable of the
name and that "llle" be added as the
second syllable The Idea took, and,
says the legend, then and there the
settlement was christened Sayille

CHARLOTTE  CU6H MAN
Bitter Undies; of tie One Loe Affair
of the Famous Aetreaa
V Charlotte Cushmon, the actress, was
in lore but once In her Mfe She met In
Cincinnati, wbe^e she was playing, an
actor named Clark, with whom she fell
In loe Through her efrorts Clark was
adanced to leading man In the com
pany, and the course of" true lore ran
smoothly ; 
One nlgbj the actress met a strange
woman behind the scenes between the
acts ;i^ •"
The woman came up to her and ad
dressed her thusPersonal
"You an Charlotte Custiman, the
great actrwc Haen't you got enough
men to admire you without coming be
tween man and wife and robbing me
of my husband?" =, ;
; "Your husband r cried Miss OUBh
nwn, getting excited
'• ^Tes, and you hae taken or you are
trying to take him from me," contin
ued the ragged woman, looking Miss
Cushman full In the face " 
"Who is your husband?"
"Conrad Clark," replied the woman,
"the father of this child" pointing to a
half stared, thin little child in her
arms
Miss Cushman started as If she had
been shot
She went through her part that night
as usual—acted It splendidly— brought
down the bouse; then, after the per
formance, she sent for Clark to come to
her dressing room Clark knocked and
then opened the door She brought for
ward to him his wife and baby, who
had been waiting In the dressing room
to receie him
 Such a reception! Charlotte Cushman
neer looked or acted so grandly on the
stage In all her life as she did that
night In her dressing room She waed
Clark away with a greater majesty
than eer as Queen Catherine she
wared away Cardinal Wolsey, and then
going to her hotel probably she had a
good crying spell
 But she neer loed again

Well ressed Women Wko Wear
Goods Seat on Approal
When the ways of some women are
considered, it Is less remarkable that
such numbers of women dwelling Is
the large cities dress extraagantly
than before their methods of securing
rich costumes for all occasions hay©
been scrutinized
There are women, and many of them
ery wealthy, who make a regular
practice of haing elegant garments
sent to their homes on approal, wear
Ing them once and then returning them
to stores or costumefB Some women
will wear a dress or a cloak to the
opera and send it back next morning
Or they will get a hat or wrap and go
driing or isiting in it The aerage
person would be astonished to know all
the things, from handsome umbrellas
a<id fans of great beauty to Jewelry
and clothes, that some women bor
row from the shops
Of course all of these women are not
well off, but they all dress well and
go out a great deal, and although the
shopkeepers often discoer the manner
in which they are being deceied, they
do not always like to make a fuss for
fear of losing a good customer Besides
they know that if they incur the enmi
ty of such impostors the women are
quite capable of abusing their goods
and robbing them of other and more
honest customers Strange as it may
seem, these women generally mingle la
pretty good society, or the fringes of It
and hae some Influence in the matter
of dress, since they hae won the repu
tation of always dressing elegantly and
In the newest things
This sort of Imposition had been car
ried on so often by a customer of a cer
tain large firm that its members deter
mined to put a stop to her flaunting
about in borrowed plumage, at least
when the plumage belonged to them
One Saturday this woman had a splen
did wrap sent home on approal, and
on Sunday one of the head clerks of
the firm who knew Mrs Blank as the
offender stationed himself near her
pew in the fashionable church which
she attended When she sailed down
the aisle after serice, resplendent in
the borrowed cloak, this man stepped
up to her and saidPersonal
"How do you do, Mrs Blank? I am
delighted to see that you like our cloak
well enough to keep it"
Of course after that she could not re
turn the cloak
8011, with all the efforts put forward
by shops and costumers to break up
the pernicious habit of forcible borrow
ing on the part of sundry feminine cus
tomers, the practice goes merrily on,
and many a fair dame with an eni
able reputation for exquisite dressing
appears but once In garments and hats
that when next seen are bedecking an
other woman or hanging In the show
room of eome smart shop—Washington
Barred Out immigrant!
Uncle Sam has a black list of birds
and quadrupeds which it is absolutely
prohibited to introduce into this coun
try, says the Chattanooga Times The
mongoose, the flying fox and the star
ling are on the list The mongoose Is a
species of ferret a natie of India,
where It is domesticated as a sort of
animal rat trap and snake destroyer
It was Introduced Into Jamaica to get
rid of the sugar cane rats These ex
terminated, howeer, the mongoose
went on to diet off the insect destroy
ing birds, with the result that the crops
hae been deastated by Insects In
some sections of the island The ani
mal is exceedingly crafty, nocturnal In

WHEN BTARCH WAS NEW

wrapped the package up be talked
"Starch originated," he said, "in
Flanders It ,was Introduced into Eng
land, with the big ruff, in the time of
Queen Elizabeth It was like our starch
of today, except that it was made in

be applied';  r   , s ^ » •> ra^'j ! _Personal•
"Before Queen Elizabeth's time ruf

land,' which required  n0  stiffening
Then the raffs of cambric enrne, and
these must of necessity, be starched"
The grocer, consulting his memoran
dum book, resumedPersonal
"It is recorded that 'when the queen
had ruffs made of lawn and cambric
for her own princely wearing there was
none in | England could tell how to
starch them; but the queen made spe
cial means for some women that could
starch, and Mrs Guliham, wife of the
royal coachman, was the first starch
er/
"In 1664 a Flanders woman,' Frau
Van der Flame, came to London and
established  there a school for  the
teaching of starching The school suc
ceeded, j  The , Flanders frau got rich
She charged £5 a lesson and an extra
20 shillings for a recipe for the making
of starch out of wheat flour, bran and
roots • • —  •  •  
"Yellow  was the  most fashionable
color In starch among the nobility The
Puritans used blue starch, though at
first they had been against the stuff al
together, dabbing it 'a certalne kinde of
llqulde matter which they call starch,
wherein the deil hath willed them to
wash and Ulo^ their ruffes, which,
when they be dry, will then stand stiffe

RUSSIA'S MARCH TO THE SEA
Russia's determination, as ei
denced by recent diplomatic cor
respondence with China, to retain
its grip npon Manchuria, will cause
a protest from i the seeral powers
interested, and that is about all
Manchuria is a large proince form
ing the northeastern portion of the
Chinese empire It embraces an
area of 370,000 square miles A
better idea of its extent may be
gained perhaps by saying that it is
as large as California, Arizona and
Neada combined And this ast
territory the insiatiable Russian
Bear proposes to gobble up with
little ceremony uring the Boxer
troubles in China Russia took ad
antage of circumstances, and
placed strong military guards at
strategic points throughout Man
churia under the plea of protecting
its railroad lines— then in course of
construction through that land
Manchuria lies in the direct line of
Russian expansion south and east
Russia wants it not merely because
it is an important step  toward se
curing an open port on the Yellow
sea, but also because it is contiguous
to her ast Siberian possessions For
hundreds of years this latter reason
has been sufficient to cause the great
northern power to annex territory
It matters not whether the land be
a desert, inhospitable and uninhab
itable, if it borders on Russian terri
tory that in itself is deemed suffici
ent cause for its absorption And
whereer Russia plants its standard,
a'npop— iwtor," n iidß kftk 1 ttnrpo&Vj
abode, but to stay Only once since
she started out in her wonderful
 career of conquest and expansion
has she parted with territory That
was in the case of Alaska, which she
disposed of to the United States It
was separated from her other pos
sessions by Behring sea Alaska
was outside her sphere of influence;
in a different world as it were She
could not reach it by land, and to
protect and deelop it by sea was
not in accordance with her tradi
tions So she surrendered it for a
price Since then, howeer, she has
added to her dominions an  area
many times the extent of her former
American possessions This latest
grab of Manchuria is more than half
as large as Alaska The United
States with other commercial nations
is interested in this Manchurian
seizure, inasmuch aa it iolates the
open door policy guaranteeing equal
trade priileges to all Russia is
an adept in oercoming, such dif
ficulties She will pacify these
countries by promising special trad
ing concessions A narrow strip of
Corea now remaius between Russia
and the seaboard facing Japan
Japan takes this latest moe of
Russia to heart more than any other
nation It affects her more than
any other power It means, Russia
as the paramount power on the sea
board fronting Japan This is not
to the liking of the latter nation,
which is not enamoured with Russia
as a neighbor Japan is a naal and
military power not to be despised
een by the Colossus of the North
Single handed, she is no match for
Russia, at any rate not in a military
sense From a naal standpoint
Russia is astly superior also in
battleships Neither nation has
much history in the way of accom
plishments on the sea to boast of
Japan, it is true, acquitted herself
well, both on land and sea, in her
recent contest with China Russia
is absolutely without a naal record
with modern war essels Without
assistance from one or more of the
great powers, it is hardly probable
that Japan will do more than pro
test against the pushing of the
Russian frontier to the sea coast
The Calaeras Prospect thinks
Amador county is making a great
ado about a trifle in the prominence
gien to the change made by the last
legislature in giing constables and
justices of the peace a salary in
place of fees in criminal business A
similar law was passed relatie to
Calaeras county, but our cotem
porary says it is generally under
stood that the law does not become
effectie until after the present of
ficial term expires With that
understanding the main cause for
objection, is remoed The constitu
tional barrier falls, and the only ques
tion that remains is the wisdom of
the change We do not know how
it may strike the taxpayers of Cala
eras county, but the citizens of
Amador are not disposed to look at
a law which imposes »n additional
burden of $20,000 in four years as a
small matter It is just such "small"
matters that make the aggregate of
taxation burdensome The lax rate
in our sister county is now 20 cents
less than in Amador The question
therefore has not reached that acute
stage there that it has with us
Howeer, if laws which tend to
jump the running expenses thous
ands of dollars a year are treated as
of little interest to the press or to
the taxpayers, een though the in
crease takes effect four years hence,
our rich neighbor will "get there"
in due time

sented by L J Fontenrose
Expansion

office The improement is a moe in
the right direction, and the doctor is
now proided with quarters second to
none
Natural feed is remarkably short in
this section considering the unusually
faorable season we hae had Rain
fell at just the right time, and it was
thought that grass would be ery
plentiful It is not so, howeer, and
the reason is not easy of explanation
Grain is also short, although healthy
and igorous in appearance Timely
showers will bring it out all right, and
I ensure a good crop
THE BIG STRIKE OVER
Both Sides Satisfied— Mines Getting
Into Banning Order Again
The big strike came to an end Fri
day night At that time a special
meeting of Jackson Union was held It
was eident throughout the day that
important business was on hand M
W Moor, of the Western Federation,
had isited Paloma during the day,
and the superintendents of all the
mines had also had a meeting during
the day From these things, it was
surmised that the special meeting was
called to consider some proposition
toward ending the struggle As soon
as the members gathered in their hall,
aid McCluro, superintendent of the;
Gwin mine, was inited to make a state
ment in behalf of the mine owners, em
bodying what they were disposed to
grant He diseu^i'U at some length
tho points in dispute, and thereafter
presented the following propositions in
writing as the final stand of the mine
ownersPersonal
(1) No discrimination against union
men as such
(2) Substitution of nine hours for
what is now ten hours underground
with same rate of wages
ExplanatoryPersonal— Said shift to begin
when first men start down from collar
of shaft, and to end when first men
start up shaft from station after quit
ting work, with time taken for lunch
added In other words, time required
to get to work and time to get to sta
tion after work to be on companies'
time, and time required to get out of
shaft at end of shift and to eat lunch
on men's time
(3) That reinstatement be left to the
discretion of the mine management
(4) Union not to bo recognized
Mr McClure, after making his state
ment, withdrew, and the union deliber
ated oer the matter The discussion,
howeer, was brief, and in a short time
he was informed by M yV Moor
that his proposition had been accepted,
and the strike had been called off It
was getting along toward  midnight
when the result was' known, / The
union men showed their gratification
Qypr the', end pt J,be pgntrßyersy by
rounds of pheers, and eerybody scorned
happy that the termination came as
soon as it did, without that serious
disturbance of business "; conditions
which a prolongation of the conflict
was bound to bring about V  "
 The terms of settlement regarding
the working hours are so plainly stated
that it is hardly possible that they cau
be I misunderstood  The , new system
means a substitution of nine' working
hours in the place of \en Jn other
wgrds a cgncejjsion by the sunerjntend
entß of one full hour in working time
The miners, howeer, while they fully
understand the language, claim that it
means 1J hours less per day to them
So that under these circumstances, the
reformed time table gies the utmost
satisfaction to the men, and at the
same time concedes a reduction qf the
working hours underground which had
long before tbe strike been under seri
ous consideration of the mine managers
It is confidently expected that the
minus will lose nothing by the change
That the same amount of work will be
done in nine hours that has heretofore
been done in ten with the same num
ber pf njon fndeed tho men them
seles are not backward in saying that
they will show by actual results that
tbe nine hour day will be a saing all
round
Sunday afternoon the union miners
had a grand parade in commemoration
of the settlement It was distinctly
understood that it was not designed as
a glorification on their part oer the
outcome It was not In the spirit of
oxultatipn, but simply an orderly turn
out to express the general feeling of re
lief oer the ending of the trouble
The procession started from the hall
on Cpurt street, headed by the Jackson
band By actual count' the parade
numbered a little oer 300 In front of
the Central hotel a halt was called,
and addresses made from the balcony
W  Oulds as president of the Jack
son organization introduced the speak
ers Brief addresses were made by r
Lonigo, R C Bole and It Tadich, the
latter addressing them In English,
Italian and Austrian
Monday morning the Zeila mine re
sumed work Seeral days must elapse
before a, full force is put on The Ken
nedy will take seeral days to drain
the mine and get in fix to employ a full
complement of men The new mill
was started Monday on ore from the
dump There Is plenty of this on hand
to keep the mill going for some time
As might be anticipated some dis
sension at once arose in setting the new
time schedule into operation At the
Kennedy and Oneida, the time allowed
for dinner did not suit some These
mines pursued the same course in this
respect that was in ogue before the
strike namely one hour for dinner
The miners, or some of them, wanted
half an hour, and to eat underground
This would reduce the workday half
an hour Another bone of contention
arose in relation to a few men who were
not taken back to work Although
this point is coered by the terms of
settlement, leaing the question of
reinstatement In the hands of the
superintendent, tho men wore under
the impression that all who went out
on strike would be restored to employ
ment; that tho reinstatement related
only to those who were discharged
before the strike Notices were posted
up Monday calling a special meeting
of Jackson Union for Tuesday eening
That meeting passed, howeer, with
out any action in regard to these ques
tions As soon as the Kennedy man
agement became aware of the kick
about lunch 'hour, the half hour ar
rangement was promptly conceded
There Is no doubt that all the man
agers took the course deemed best to
faithfully carry out the terms of the
agreement, and to satisfy their em
ployes

Henry Bradley, the shakemaker,
bought a horse some fie months ago
from a person in the mountains The
animal proed a fair saddle horse, and
Bradley was congratulating himself on
his bargain, whon the matter assumed
a phase that he little anticipated
Monday he rode to lone on the horse,
and was told on the way that he was
riding a stolen horse; that it belonged
to the Bonnefoys He came on to
Jackson, and sure enough the horse
was identified as one that had been
missed from the Bonnefoy pasture se
eral months ago Bradley was perfect
ly innocent in the matter, and was the
ictim of a poor bargain There was
nothing to do but to surrender the
animal to its owner, and seek redress
from the party from whom It was pur
chased He turned oer the horse
Tuesday morning He had made ar
rangements to go to his mountain place
that day, but this turn of affairs left
him without any way of traersing the
thirty miles except on foot Bradley
says this Is just about the sort of luck
that has attended him In his trading

in the park near the race track on
Thursday eening The bo<iy was
discoered by Michael Scully, who lies
at the track, about 6 o'clock Thursday
eening, who immediately reported the

from the facts deeloped at the inesti
gation that the deceased repaired to

heard by W Sutherland between 5 and
6in the eening A hammerless re
oler of 38 calibre, with one empty

wound in the head, told the story of
the end Two unsealed letters were
found on the body, both dated April
22, the day before the shooting One
was addressed to Miss Grace Westfall,
and the other to Mrs R R Scott,
mother of deceased Each letter, was
written on a half sheet "of note paper,
with lead ponoll These documents
throw no light on the cause of self de
struction, other than to show that the
act was premedltated, and that a
brooding melancholy disposition was
the moing cause In both letters he
stated that he had had no trouble with
any one He requested that the letters
be not published, and that the one to
"Grace," haing a twocent stamp at
tached, be sealed and deposited in the
postoffice The jury returned a erdict
in accordance with the aboe facts

HOW OGS FIN THEIR WAY
eidence Tbat They l'oaaena Pecul
iar Power to Guide TUcni
lii the old days of tbe James rier
canal a fine setter was taken by his
master on a packet boat which was so
crowded that the dog was put la tho
captain's cabin to be out of the way,
says the New York Mall and Express
Ills owner reached his destination aft
er nightfall and had taken bo much
wine by that time that he waa carried
off the boat, and no one remembered
liis setter
Next morning the captain took the
dog on deck with him, but was much
afraid he would Jump off to the tow
path and try to return that w nyi and so
handsome an animal would hae been
in danger of being stolen
Carlo, howeer, lay perfectly quiet,
but with an air of listening that at
tracted notice Toward noon he heard
the sound of the born of a packet com
ing from the opposite way, and as the
boats passed each other he made a leap
and was next heard from as haing
got off at the place where his master
had stopped and as haing gone at
once to the house where he was a
guest
Could human Intelligence hae sur
passed that?
This same dog lay on his master's
grae and refused food until be 'died
from staration But I do not gie this
as a case in point
A gentleman who lied a hundred
miles from a city moed there with all
his possessions, including a bulldog
which bad been raised at his father's
home, where he had hitherto resided
He was locked up In the CBr with the
furniture and in the bustle of unloading
disappeared, and two days afterward
he reached his former home, coming by
an inland route, as was known by par
ties who recognized him, so that he ei
dently marked out his own path with
out reference to the railroad on which
he had been carried away
THE OMNIBUS
It Vu Introduced by BlsJse Pascal,
tbe Noted Mathematician
No less a personage than the famous
mathematician, Blaise Pascal, Is said
to hae Introduced the ehicle which
we call the "omnibus" Unlike most
other men of learning, Pascal was more
or less Interested In the affairs of prac
tical life He was the Inentor of the
pushcart that now perambulates our
streets, says the Scientific American 
In 1001 he had largo wagons built
for regular traffic In the heart of Paris
He allied himself In this undertaking
with seeral influential friends, ameng
whom was the uke of Roannes
In 1002 Louis XIV granted letters
patent to Pascal, In which It was said
that these carriages were Intended for
the comfort of poor people who had to
go to courts of Justice or who were
sick and so poor that they could not af
ford to pay the two plstoea exacted by
the chairmen anfi the driers of
coaches
At first the use of the ehicle was
not generally permitted A royal de
cree forbade Its use by soldiers, pages,
lackeys aud other lieried serants, as
well as artisans and porters
Pascal, In spite of the fact that he
only lied to be thirtynine, is said to
hae made no inconsiderable sum out
of his Inention Personal
After the ehicle had been in use
some sixteen years it was abandoned
for arious reasons! It was not until
1812 that It was again Introduced, this
time in Bordeaux, which city was fol
lowed In 1821 by Nantes and in 1827
by Paris The ehicle was Improed
and rapidly became popular Now it
has been almost displaced by the tram
way
In modern times the ehicle was
called an omnibus simply for the rea
son that it was intended for the car
riage of all, without any restrictions as
to lackeys, pages or footmen
His Mistake
"Once at a party," sold a Scotch cler
gyman, "there was a crusty old Scot
seated at a whist table playing pas
sionately, and his partner was a young
woman, the daughter of a neighboring
laird You are to" Imagine this young
woman's surprise In the heart of the
game when the old fellow threw down
his cards and bawled at herPersonal
" 'What kind of a game are ye play
In", ye darned auld'—
"And then, recollecting himself, he
bowed and said humbly to the aston
ished girlPersonal
"'Yer pardon's begged, madam I
took ye In the excitement for my aln

Marriage an* Crime
It is said that statistics proe that in
eery 1,000 bachelors there are thirty
eight criminals, while in eery 1,000
married men the criminals number only
eighteen If this is go, it surely proes
that the present day members of the
Bex labeled coy and hard to please hae
at least an immense capability for
keeping men out of mischief, sufficient
to outbalance perhaps een the unkind
reputation handed down the ages by

STANTON'S IRISH STEW
A Story of the Great War Secretary
a; Told by His Bodyguard
An attempt by Secretary of War
Stanton to cook an Irish stew while
holding the war department office
against the remoal order of President
"Andrew Johnson is one of many anec
dotes related by Louis Koerth, at the
period mentioned the great war secre
tary's bodyguard
Feb 21, 1808, President Johnson ap
poiuted General Lorenzo Thomas sec
retary of war ad Interim, but the pow
er of remoal haing been taken by
the tenure of office act from the presi
dent, Mr Stauton refused to resign or
to acate the office of secretary
He camped in the office, determined
to hold it until the result of the Im
peachment proceedings against the
president, which were then pending in
the senate, should be determined For
sixty days Mr Stanton heid "the fort"
and during that period his faithful
bodyguard, exSergeant Louis Koerth,
then In the United Btates general ser
ice, assigned to the war department,
kept him company
On the day In which Mr Stanton re
ceied the official notification of his
remoal by the president he made Im
mediate preparations for a siege He
dispatched Sergeant Koerth to Mrs
Stanton for blankets and pillows, but
that lady refused to send them, Insist
ing that the secretary should come
home aud gie up the office
Mr Stanton smiled on receiing her
message and simply saidPersonal
"Koertb, go to your own house and
bring blankets, pillows and such cook
Ing utensils as we may need"
The Irish stew was the first effort
of the secretary and his bodyguard'
Koerth, being a German, needed in
structions in the mysteries of prepar
ing the saory stew, and the secretary
named the arious ingredients, which
he ordered the serant to purchase ;
Both men had spent a busy and la
boriously exciting day, and both were
tired out when the pot was put on the
fire to cook the stew
The consequence was that the great
war secretary and his bodyguard fell
asleep The secretary was tbe first to
be awakened by the smell of the burn
Ing stew
"Koertb, Koerth I Wake up, man!"
shouted Mr Stanton "Tbe stew Is
burnlngP'
Koerth sprang to his feet, but, alas,
too late to sae Mr Stanton's Irish
stew It was burned and smoking,
while the pot was a glowing red Rue
fully the secretary rolled himself up In
his blankets on the sofa and went to
sleep for the night supperiess—Wash

POULTRY POINTERS
A healthy fowl will drink fifteen or
twenty times a day
Sharp grael should always be sup
plied to fowls that are fattened In close
confinement
Box nests are all right If made large
enough, the size depending upon the
breed of fowls
Linseed meal is excellent as an egg
producing meal, but it should be fed in
connection with coarse or bulky foods
Soft eggs laid before the shell has
formed are caused by oerfeeding Gie
less food and more pounded shells oi
Ilmewater
A aried diet for poultry is a neces
sary help to their general health and
has much to do with their alue aa
breeders >;'
If disease appears and resists reme
dies, It Is better to begin with new
stock than to breed from those that
hae been sick a long time
A light, sandy soil is always best for
a poultry yard A heay clay soil is al
ways damp and, unless care is taken,
will cause roup, while a sandy soil, be
ing dry, will promote warmth
Appreciated Himself
A little boy while playing near the
Serpentine fell into the water An
Irish laborer who was passing at the
time courageously jumped Into tbe wa
ter, clothes and all, and rescued the
boy, says Spare Moments
A lady who had obsered the brao
deed went up to Pat and, shaking his
hand, saidPersonal
"I feel It on honor, my brae man,
to shake hands with you Many a
worse man than you had been present
ed at court"
"Faith, you're roight, mum/ replied
Pat as he proceeded to wring the wa
ter out of his coat "Tb* last tolme dl
waa preslnted at court Oi only got one
month, wholle me mate got two, begor
ral"
Saed I>y the Soloist
An old lady who at the best was cer
tainly not ery musical attended
church one morning a little while ago
uring the serice an anthem was
sung by the choir, during which a cer
tain Mr Wood rendered a solo When
returning home, the old lady remarked
to a friendPersonal
"ear, dear! What a mesa they made
of that anthem, to be sure Why, if it
bad not been for Mr Wood they would
hae broken down  entirely in one
part"— London Standard
Matched
Towne— Met Gabble and Perkins at
n smoker last night and introduced
them to each other
Browne— Oh, say, It's a shame to In
troduce a bore Uke Gabble to anybody
Towne— lt's eident you don't know
Perkins or you'd see the humor of It
Criticising His Own
"But, my dear husband, It really Is
Unjust of you to abuse mothersinlaw
o There are good ones"
"Well, well; neer mind I haen't
