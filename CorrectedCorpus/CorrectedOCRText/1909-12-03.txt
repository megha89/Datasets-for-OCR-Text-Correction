Kills Girl; Goes Free
Paris, Noember 20—  srange ale
of a romance which had a ragic ending
was relaed a he Siene ssize Cour,
when a young man named Sora, he
son of a merchan ;who lef him abou
$'25,000, was ried for killing his mis
ress, a music hall sar known as
Muguc, which signifies "Lily of he
Valley, " who was in her 0h year
Sora made her acquainance a lgiers,
and soon fell desperaely in loe He
accompanied Mile iMuge from place
o place when she was on her profes
sional ours, going wih her as far us
Russia, bu, as was explained a he
rial, she seldom had a good word for
him
Much of his infauaion was ari
bued o his haing acquired anoher
habn her sociey In reply o a ques
ion from he presiding judge, he said Personal
"I waned o do like her, and so ook
eher I seemed a ery simple process
 firs I was dazzled I saw isions,
and when I gazed upon Muge a my
side she appcrcd o me more beauiful
and younger nd she kep exclaiming,
"Take more, ake more! and 1 hough
of nohing bu her"
Tries o Break Spell
One day he ried o break he spell,
and remoed o anoher house, bu she
followed him herePersonal "nd when I saw
her, ' he signed, "I could no desis'
Ye, een from he accoun of winess,
Muguc led him a dog's life " She had
no faul o find wih him,' one of her
female friends N explained, —"bu she
hough him a dreadful bore" She used
a say o him Personal
I no longer loe you 1 hae neer
loed you I regre he genleman
friends ha I had before I me you I
wan o see hem again lam sill fond
of hem ail"
On he faal day, February 17, Sora
escored his misress o a bouleard
cafe frequened by ariss in ques of an
engagemen "Say here a he door and
wai for me," she said, as she wen
in, leaing he unlucky man wih her
dog oujin he bier cold Hours craw
led by and here he sood like an unre
lieed senry "You migh hae gone
in," he judge remarked "She had
forbidden me o do so," Sora answered
eidenly regarding his as a sufficien
reason 
Meanwhile, Mugue was chaing gayly
wih friends in he warm cafe, aud
making fun of her loer as he shiered
in he cold ouside; bu no one joined
in her merrimen, for hey all piied
him  las she condescended o join
Sora, who ook her off o dinner a a
resauran s hey passed by a flower
sall he bough her a bouque of ioles,
and she hrew n his face Maers
were no more conforable when hey go
o he resuaran "There were a lo of
people, and hey were looking a us I
was quie ashamed" Sora relaed
Een when hey had reurned o heir
abode Mugue kep on auning him
Young lan Is cquied
"She saidPersonal "I am sick of you; you
disgus me " She insuled me and
called me names, when I had spen
810,000 on her She saidPersonal "I am going
o hrow you hings ou of he window
I loe anoher man" nd his o me
who had lef my home, my family,
eeryhing ha I was fond of, 1 was be
ing urned away like a dog There was
a reoler on he able and I fired I
no longer knew wha I did"
Some of Muguc's former male friends
were hen called as winesses They
had no a word o say agains Sora
On he conrary, hey spoke kindly of
him, bu hey gae a poor accoun of
heir experience of Mugue
"When a man has a misress who
makes him unhappy, he bes hing for
him o do is o leae her," dryly re
mrked he adocae general in his ad
dress, adding ha he would no objec
o Sora's being allowed he benefi of

no need for his, as he cour, afer a
