EVERYTHING POINTS TO TFT
ll delegaes o he republican naional conenion haing
been eleced, i begins o look ha Taf is desined o receie
he nominaion on he firs ballo  clear majoriy of he
delegaes are under insrucions o oe for he man from
Ohio, and ha seles i, unless somehing exraordinary
happens o change he siuaion, which is oo remoe a con
ingency o be considered I is hined ha La Follee of Wis
consin, who is himself among he lis of darkhorse candi
daes, will ry o sampede he conenion by placing Roose
el in nominaion The moe is said o aim a booming
himself ino line for he presidenial nominaion four years
hence Bu perhaps he objec is o sampede he pend ng
conenion o himself, afer he fashion of Bryan's cross of
gold speech in he democraic conenion wele years ago
 sudied plan of ha characer would hae no he shadow
of a chance, no maer wha eloquence was brough ino play
in he effor o carry no effec I is no probable ha all
opposiion o Taf will mel away before he conenion mees
Whaeer opposiion here may be o Taf, s based solely
on he ground ha he is belieed o be backed by he srengh
of he adminisraion Nohing can be said agains him per
sonally Tha he is in eery way qualified for he high po
siion is conceded by all s a cabine officer he has shown
saesmanship of he highes order He has been he righ
hand man of he Rooseel adminisraion He is hearily
in sympahy wih he reform policies inauguraed by Roose
el, bu no an exremes Of course, he is commied o he
republican principle of proecion, alhough in faor of ariff
reision where i can be applied wihou aacking he pro
ecie principle or endangering he home indusries Wih
Taf and Bryan as candidaes — and ha is how eens seem
o be shaping — he main issue would be proecion ersus
free rade, or a ariff for reenue only, as he democras pre
fer o call i, which really means he same hing In such a
campaign he oucome is no doubful Wih he long period
of prosperiy as he resul of republican ascendancy under
he flag of proecion, which eery secion of he counry has
enjoyed, Taf will be picked as an easy winner The alk of
he disaffecion of he labor unions oward Taf will cu lile
figure Een if here is any ruh in such alk, which is
quesionable, he laboring men are no going o embrace
he heresies of Bryan, which mean a lack of employmen and
a sweeping cu in wages for hem ebs will probably head
he socialis icke, and may arac some oes from he
ranks of labor This will be likely o hur Bryan more han
Taf Wih Taf nominaed, all dissension in republican
ranks will a once disappear, and he will be carried o icory
by an oerwhelming oe

There is only one way to euro deafneii,

Deafness Is cuused by un inllaini-d con

imperfect hearing, and whun it in en
tirely closed, deafness is tho ivsull,
and unloss thu inflammation can bo
taken out and this tubo restored to its

Good Ctiuso For Tsars.
A certain mediaeval BUltnn had nil tho
mirrors removed from hla palace, so
that he might avoid tho pain of see
ing his o-.vn fnco. This sultan called
on hit) grand vizlo? ono day and by nc-
Cldont happened to patch Bight of his
reflection. Ola bldeousnesu overpow
ered him, and lie broke Into violent
Bobbing, In this outburst tho vizier
Joined, Finally the sultan calmed
down, wiped hla eyes and got ready to
Diao!:a and talk. Bat not so the vizier,
lie gobbed on ijrid on. Illy master, tap
pins hl3 slipper .impatiently on the
cushions, waited lor him [to caase. At
length tiie sultan got angry and ex
claimed:
"Why do you Aveep longer tjian I,
vizier V"
"Alas," the grand vizier relied, "you
wept, O commander of tho faithful,
because you saw your face but for an
Instant, but I see It all day and every
day."
A Dubious Compliment:.
"It looks well, but I am afraid It is
dubious," said a financier, speaking of
a proposed scheme. "Yes, it is dubious.
It reminds me of the Turkish pasha
and his wife.
"A Turkish pasha lay dying. lie
summoned to him the youngest and
fairest of his forty-six wives and said
to her In a low, weak voice:
" Tut on your richest costume, your
most brilliant jewels. Deck your hair
with pearls and brighten your Duger
tips with henna.'
"The young wife blushed. Even in
her grief she was flattered.
" 'And why, my lord,' she said, 'do
yon desire me to make this sumptuous
toilet?'
" 'So that death when It comes,' tho
man replied, 'seeing you so beautiful,
may perhaps carry you off instead of
inn ' "
Motion of tho Sun.
Owing to tho revolution of the earth
the sun seems to rnal;e its dally cir
cuit around us, which of course Is not
the case. But tho sun Is revolving
about Its center quite as truly as the
earth Is. It was one of the conceptions
of that most remarkable man, Sir John
Ilerschel, that the whole solar system
had a motion in space and was ad
vancing toward a point In the heavens
near the star Hercules. Sir John's con
ception—as bold an idea as ever en
tered the human mind— ls now gener
ally accepted by astronomers, and the
opinion is qolto universal among them
that tho entire system is tracing out a
curvilinear path in space, a course
around some mighty center, probably
nt Hercules.
Good Enough to Charge For.
When William 11. Scott was man
aging clerk in the early sixties for the
Qrra of Cleveland & Titus, a client
came in and wanted an opinion right
away. No member of the firm was in.
Accordingly, Mr. Scott, ■with some hesi
tation, wrote the opinion. When his
principal, Mr. Cleveland, came in, he
explained the circumstances and show
ed him the opinion. Mr. Cleveland
looked at him with n smile and then
read it with care. "Humph," said lie;
"pretty poor opinion, but It will do to
charge."— New York Times.
A Caustic Reply.
A gentleman once said to n harrister,
"That was a very good sermon of your
father's today." To which lie replied:
"Yes. lie must havo cribbed it from
some otic." Hut the father overheard
this remark and reminded him that the
Bible says, "The ox knoweth his owner
and the ass his master's crib." This
caustic reply silenced the barrister.—

Tho Rapid Rise of Clive.
The evidences of dive's genius, said
Lord Curzou, were Incontestable. In
nine years he had risen from being a
poor and uukuowu clerk to be one of
tho most famous captains of his own
or any other age.
