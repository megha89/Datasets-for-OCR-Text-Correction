IN THE HEDGE BOTTOM
How the Harvest Mice Built
Their Home
MARY ELLIOT
jLittle Personal Mrs Harvest-Mouse loved -a
hedge" Ijottom She always said it was
more "private than the open field, and
aIBO she thought about the farmer and
how he comes to cut the corn, but
leaves the long,' stiff grass In the hedge
bottom safe and standing when the
corn Is all carried away to the barn
So when Mr Harvest-Mouse began to
talk to Mrs Harvest-Mouse about
where to bulM their home she begged
him to choose- the long,' stiff grass in
the hedge bottom rather than the corn
In the field That is how It happened
that their tiny vest was built between
the grass stems, and they built It very
cunningly of narrow blades and bits of
feather or any soft and bending stuff
that they could find, and^they" fixed
theni all In such a clever way that at
list a wee round nest no bigger than a
cricket ball was fixed high up among
the stiff green stalks as if it grew there
by -itself It was soft and light and
very thin, so the summer air blew gent
ly through and kept it nicely aired
The taller grasses standing round
about bid It from the hawks, and a lit
tle bindweed then grew up and helped
them; It twined around the stems and
twisted its tendrils from one to anoth
er,Personal then hung its tiny bells about and
made a merry garden near the nest
Mr rHarvest-Mouse was very pleased
when all was done and felt happier
still when eight little baby mice were
Biilxg and safe inside • They fitted Into
the soft, round ball quite perfectly,
whjch shows how wee they were
And now through the hot summer
days, while Mrs Harvest-Mouse was
busylwith the children, Mr Harvest-
MoOße was running here and there col
lecting news for his wife and flies' and
other food for himself and for his fam
ily- What a gay, clever, little mouse
hew as, and as for her, she was the
quickest daintiest little lady in the
land, and she taught her children to be
quick and dainty too She also taught
them" to be good, though what she
would- have done had they - been
naughty I cannot tell, for there was
not a corner In the house to stand them
in'Personal-;
fshe ran nimbly all about the outside
of the nest, and when the little ones be
gan to bite each other's tails for? fun
she patted gently through the open net
work of the walls and told them how
their long tails would be useful when
they'came to climb the tall, stiff grass
es in the green and mazy world of the
hedge bottom where they lived 'And
the' bindweed quite agreed in what she
Bal£, for It knew the value of a tail to
bolflby
One warm evening the little mother
Baton the top of her little round house,
while/Mr Harvest-Mouse was chatting
with a neighbor In the corn close by,
and then It was she told the children a
great deal about the world She told
them" how as she sat there she could
Bee the "green grass blades bending over
her and a sweet bindweed bell swing
gently-under the weight of a bumble
bee;; She said that far away, quite high
aboye^the bindweed bells, quite high
abovethe grass blades in the Bodge
bottom," even higher than the corn,
them was blue, blue sky  She could
ccc patches of it now as she looked up
through their tangled screen
The tiny mice Inside the nest got rest
less'af the, very Personal thought of that, and
they asked her to get a bit and poke it
through foMbem to see
"Ton silly, silly ones," she said, "there
are great things that you cannot under
stand In the big world, and one of them
is the blue, blue sky It is only to look
at, not to touch, and some day you will
learn that it comes with the sunshine
and goes when it rains A lark once
told me that he loved it even more than
the green world, for though the sweet
grass' cools his breast and holds his
nest and bis little ones, yet the- blue,
bine sky Is quite full of joy and 'goes
far up £bove the farmhouse smoke and
above the hawks and is wider than the
widest field, and though he were to
sing his heart out from dewy dawn to
eunset he could never fill it all with
music Oh,' the big blue 'sky Is ' very
wide,'"- Indeed, Personal and very far away, as 1
you will Bee one day when you are
strong and quite grown up"
Just- then a gnat flew by, and Mrs
Harvest-Mouse sprang up and caught
It and' gave it to the children through
the wall, for though she talked about
the 6ky she kne^ that, they were hun
gry and saw the gnat and caught it
cleverly
And' now that the sun was getting
low she talked about the winter She
said as surely as the night came on
when the daylight died away, so surely
would' the winter come when summer
time was ended
What could the winter be? the chil
dren thought, and one wee mouse made
bold to say he did not care; and it
night come any time for him He had
Just caught and eaten a tiny fly that
had crept through the network of the
nest, and be would catch and eat the
Winter, too, no doubt, Why not? He
was getting strong and bold enough for
anything
His mother gave a pat where his lit
tle ear showed pink between the grass
es and silenced all his silly talk at once
and then went on to tell how the whi
ter was as far beyond their thinking as
the blue, blue sky was high above their
heads 
"The warm, soft wind that rings our
bindweed bells/ she said, "and makes
eweet music in the grass will turn to
raid Btirt hittar hl*ist*_"th»t w m htaw
The Amador Ledger
the leaves about, and then the bells
will wither one by one and fall away,
and the grasses will turn quite dull and
dry nnd rub against each other with a
shrill nnd fearsome sound as the wind
sweeps up along the hedge bottom"
Personal At that the little mouse, whose ear
was tingling still, felt frightened, and
be quivered while his mpther talked
and wondered what would come of it
She- knew just how he felt, and now
she gave him comfort and advice about
the future, and she told them all what
they must do "For," said she, "the
winter Is too great and strong for tiny
creatures like ourselves, and so while
the big world and the hedge bottom are
bearing the cold weather we may sleep
quite peacefully, each In a tiny hole,
until the winter time is over and the
summer comes again You must seek
your holes when the right time comes
and then be sure to curl your tails well
In to keep them from the frost"
They all squeaked a little promise to
remember what she said and not think
they knew better, and then they whis
pered softly to each other of the great
world and the sky and the winter time
and; how quite soon they should be
grown up mice And while they, talked
and chattered merrily, catching flies
from time ,to time and trying who
could be most clever and saying how
much they had grown since yesterday
Mr Harvest-Mouse^ came home and
rubbed noses with his wife with a
grave and anxious air, for he brought
batl news from the corn close by The
hawk had come and caught their kind
ly neighbor, Mr Field-Mouse But this
he said quite- gently, sitting close to
Mrs Harvest-Mouse, lest the little ones
should hear "Ah," she said and heav
ed a sigh, "how glad I am we chose the
long, stiff grass In the hedge bottom
rather than the corn In the field!"
"Yes," said he; "we did well to choose
tho hedge bottom" And with that he
ran about tbe nest and counted his
eight children anxiously and scolded
them a little and then went a-hunting
for his supper till by and by the quiet
night came down and settled on the lit

 A Frencn scientist has determined
that the military and naval professions
most quickly wear out the brain Out

are confirmed lunatics Next come the
liberal professions, artists heading the
list, followed closely by lawyers and,
more distantly, by doctors, clergy, lit
erary men and civil servants The
number of those who go mad is 177 to
each 100,000 Domestic servants and
jay laborers run tbe professional men
very • close, sending 155 out of each
100,000 to the asylum These are fol
lowed at a long distance by mechanics,
only C 6 of whom go mad in each 100,
000 And the group which is most fa
vorable to sanity is, contrary to gener
al belief, that of commercial men,
which sends only 42 out of 100,000 to
the asylum

The Boy Who Learned the Way
He was very young— about 13— this
boy who spent most of his time In the
studios watching the artists draw and
paint and -wishing he conld do the
Bame ' ;Personal;
"What kind of pencils do yon use?"
he said one day, and they gave him
one of the kind That night he tried to
make a figure he had seen one of the
artists draw, It seemed so easy But
he could not do the same kind of work
"Perhaps I haven't the right kind of
paper," he reasoned "I will get a
piece tomorrow" Even the right kind
of paper did not help him any
"I need a studio and an easel," was
his next conclusion "I have the de
sire; surely all I need now are the
necessary surroundings"
A few years of Impatient waiting
passed before he secured the "neces
sary surroundings," and when he bad
them all and still found It Impossible
to draw the truth dawned upon him
"I know what Is wrong," he cried,
throwing down his pencil "I know
nothing of the principles of art I
must learn them first"
He was still young when his name as
a great painter was known on two con
tinents He bad learned the "princi
ple" A bit of brown paper and a
burned match would then enable him
to draw as easily as all the art essen
tials—Ann Partlan In Success
A young Plttsburger arose from bli
bed one morning and, dressing, went
down stairs to breakfast As he sat at
the table he carelessly put his right
hand Into his trousers pocket and was
surprised to find $725 He knew that
when he retired for the night he had
Just 25 cents and had fallen asleep
while wondering where he could bor
row money the next morning He was
highly elated over the discovery, for,
although he thought long and hard,
he could not remember how be had
come Into the possession of tbe money
After work that day he took a friend
to the opera and later to supper When
he returned home about midnight, a
brother stepped into his room and said,
"Harry, did you pay that bill for me
today r
The young man was almost dum
founded It all came to him at once
Shortly after he had retired the pre
vious night his brother had entered the
room and, placing the money In his
trousers pocket saidPersonal "Say, old man,
when you go down town tomorrow, I
wish yon would pay Mr that bill
I owe him I promised to let him have
it by tomorrow"
The young man was dozing at the
time, and that accounts for his failure
to remember what his brother had said
to him He was kept busy borrowing
from friends to make up the amount
the next day, and he declares that
hereafter his brother will have to pay

OF THE VELDT
Row Two Enemies Met
On "levers' Walk"
About six miles from our lines I ran
against a dainty little farmhouse cud
dled up against the slope of a shrub
covered kopje On one side of the
dwelling a trelllswork of vines broke
the wind at both front and rear, while
a pretty flower garden, fragrant with
flowers, spread far away in front of
the substantial dwelling I was admir
ing these things from my horse's back,
when it suddenly dawned upon me that
I had possibly played the imbecile In
straying so far from camp But it was
too late to hang back If the farmer
folk were friendly, I was in luck, for
the inside of such a dwelling could not
be ill supplied with creature comforts
If, however, they were hostile, I was
at their mercy I had no desire to
match my pony's pace against the flight
of a Mauser bullet, so, humming a
song and thinking of a psalm I rode
forward as If certain of a kindly wel
come An elderly Boer with a kindly
face met me at-the door and gave me
the time of day with all civility, a ne
gro lad took hold of my bridle, and 1
swung myself out of the saddle Just In
time to receive a civil greeting from
the farmer's wife— healthy, wholesome,
substantial, well fed and clothed They
invited me Inside, and there their four
daughters Introduced themselves to
me They all talked English as well as
I could, and before I bad been there 20
seconds I had arrived at the conclusion
that I should never get a better chance
to Ftudy the language of the people of
our foes and determined to sacrifice
myself upon the flinty shrine of duty
Three of the maidens were plain faced,
good, honest looking girls, but the
fourth bad a face like a young preach
er's first public prayer— a face that
many a man would risk his life for
I So much of my whole career has
been passed amid the rougher and
more rugged scenes of life that a de
scription of dainty womanhood comes
awkwardly from me But I have read
so much about the ugliness and clumsi
ness of the Boer woman in British
journals that I should like to try to de
scribe this daughter of the veldt, al
though only a farmer's daughter Ido
not know if she should be called short
or tall, but her cheek could have been
nestled comfortably on the shoulder of
a fairly tall man I don't know how
much hair she had, but there was
enough of It to make a fellow feel as
If he didn't care a rap if half the earth
was bald It was not red nor yellow;
It was like honey kissed by sunshine
She had the sort of forehead which one
never sees on the face of a fool, na
ture's signboard for an emporium' of
brains Her eyes were large, brown
and fearless, not bold nor yet waver
ing Her mouth was perfect — not one
of those sepulcbers which disfigure
some feminine (aces, not childishly
small like a bud bursting Into bloom,
but a strong, true mouth, large enough
for a prayer to slip through, but not
big enough to swear with Her waist
would Just about fill the crook of a
man's arm and make him feel that
there was no room for anything else
under heaven The arch of her bust
was like the curve on a wave as It
breaks on the beach In the bay; not the
stiff lath and plaster model one Is apt
to see walking around the streets of
cities  Her hands were shapely, brown
and strong, cracked a little by wind
and weather; not toy hands, but hands
that could spank a baby or help bus
band back to paths of rectitude when
all the world had damned him past re
demption
So she looked when I saw her, and I
said nnto my soul, "Verily, it Is a good
thing for his enemies' language" It
was the fifth evening after that, and I
bad registered my fifth visit to the
farm, when an event befell which put
an end to my studies hi Dutch for the
time being I had dined with the
farmers* the plain sisters had made
music for me They bad lifted their
voices in song also, for I was an hon
ored guest, having been enabled to do
Eome little deeds of kindness through
the favor of the courteous general to a
relation of the ladles who was a pris
oner In our lines They had given me
blankets and rugs for the poor beggar,
and the 'general had handed them to
the man
The night was a beautiful one, so,
lighting a cigar, I rambled down to
ward the quarter mile long avenue of
orange trees It was to be my last vis-
It, for our troops were on the move at
dawn As I sauntered forward I
beard the rustle of a woman's skirts
amid the bushes on my right, and look
ing In tliHt direction I saw the navy
lihic dri'Ks find the ml gold hair of the
girl who had been tencliing me Dutch
I had not ninny seconds to look at her,
but brief as the time wns I bad long
enough to notice that one band held
the blue skirts switched up so that
about n foot of 'white petticoat was
displayed I also noticed that she was
brnding toward tho orange walk, which
I liad long shin- Uarned was known In
the f;iPersonalii*!y as "the lovers' walk" She
ill 1 in 1 look In my direction, did not
•PersonalPersonalni townni me at all, but like many
PersonalTPersonali, ther f^o] I was puffed up In my
folly "What 1 arm la there in it," I
smaiWl "If I tote my lesson In Dutch
!m tin* PUtMle <>? the orange trees?"
Tossing my cigar away I sauntered
•lfter the flyins Spure out of the flower
 irden over the field, Into the shady
' sills I meandered like a he goat
rirou'sh si pip In a hedge, I walked
r';out rO yards nnd saw no one, heard
no one Then all at once I found my
1 elf looking right Into the face of a big
liairy ravage who wore a tweed, poat
uiid a bain' ;lier full of cartridges In
his hands he carried a handy little
Manser carbine
•Well Mr Spy," said the hairy Indi
vidual, "you nre my prisoner"
I tried to smile, but somehow the
springs- in my face had got out of order
aud would not work
"What did you want sneaking after
me for you beastly Englishman?"
snarled the man with the gun "I could
hsive shot you last night and the night
before that if I had liked, but I did not
want to bring trouble on this farm
What do you want to hunt me for?"
I found my tongue for a moment

We stared at each other like two
grass fed calves In the starlight, and I
edged a foot or two away from the
gun Just then I heard tbe patter of
girlish feet on the gravel behind me
and, turning my head, saw one of the
plain sisters hurrying toward us, and
almost at tbe same second the reddish
gold head of the "beauty," the head of
the girl who bad been teaching me
Dutch, paused from a patch of shad
ow into the streak of starlight where
the hairy young giant was standing
fondling his gun I saw her clasp his
arm, heard her hurriedly whisper some
thing in Dutch which caused the giant
to grin as If half his head ached to
part company with the other half The
"beauty" pointed toward me and the
plain sister, who had come to a halt
beside me The plain girl put her hand
kindly on my shoulder and whispered,
"Don't yon think It's too chilly out
here?"
Chilly was no name for It I was as
cold as Klondike The sight of that
carbine In tbe starlight bad taken all
the warmth out of the atmosphere as
far as I was concerned I turned to
fro when a little hand touched mine
The girl who had been teaching me
Dutch was air my side "Before you
gentlemen leave," she said, "I want
you both to make a promise Yon
are enemies now Some day when the
war is over you may be friends But
promise not to hurt each other by talk
ing of this meeting Otto had no busi
ness to come Father had forbidden
him until the trouble ended with the

"1 came out of love for yon," grunted
the man with tbe gun
"And you came out of fondness for
me," murmured the plain girl, her
voice shaking with laughter that was
almost choking her I muttered the
biggest He I had ever parted with
The hairy Individual rested his gun
against a tree, stepped forward and
lifted bis slouch hat to the plain girl,
"For your sake I promise"
I lifted my helmet to tho "beauty"
and said something similar A few
minutes later as I was buckling my
girth's I heard him galloping off south
ward to Join Ollvler*B commando As
I swung Into my saddle the plain, sister
slipped away, and the "beauty" lifted
her band in farewell As our hands
met she said, "Why did you come to
lovers' walk?" _
"To get a lesson In Dutch," I said,
with a sheepish grin
"Well," she answered, "1 hope you'll
remember your lesson" And I heard

SHE IS MY LOVE
111 1 the measure of tbe original Irish Gaelic lon
song] 
She is my love beyond all thought,
Though she bath wrought my deepest dote;
Yet dearer tor the cruel pain
Than one who fain would make me whole
She is my glittering gem of gems,
Who yet contemns my fortune bright
Whose cheek but glow* with redder ecom
Since mine has worn a stricken white
She is my sun and moon and star
Who yet so far and cold doth keep;
She would not even o'er my bier
One tender tear of pity weep
Into my heart unsought she came,
A wasting flame, a haunting can;
Into my heart of hearts, ah, why?
And left a sigh forever there
—Alfred Perceval Graves in Spectator
Holding Ills Job For Him
"Of all the excuses I have ever heard
from people for not paying their bills,"
said a collector for a prominent firm
the other day, "I got tbe neatest today
from a very wealthy »man who always
owes the house a bill No matter
whether the bill Is for $10 or $100, he
always pays $5 I have gone back the
next week and got $5 more, and once 1
went back twice ln one week, and he
paid me $5 each time and seemed glad
to see me 1 got to know him pretty
well, and the other day I asked him
why he did not pay It all, as I knew be
bad the money"
•* -Well,' said the old f ellow, 'if I pay
yon everything- 1 owe yon at one time
yon will collect so fast that pretty soon
you will be out of a job for the want of
something to collect'
"I don't know whether that was his
reason or not, but I let the subject drop
and am Just going around there now
tor another $s"— Memphis Scimitar
A Woman's Fate
Tells its own story A laugh is often a
lie on a woman's lips It belies the pain
which is tearing at the nerves Bat the
eyes have no part in the laugh Their
purple rings speak of suffering There
are lines too about the mouth which only
pain can give Many women look for-
ward to a week of such misery each
month Three months of each year are
given up to suffering It weakens them
It ages them It robs them of social
pleasures and family joys Can there be
any excuse for such women who fail to
try Dr Pierce's Favorite Prescription?
It has cured thousands of such sufferers
Cured them perfectly and permanently
It cures ninety-eight out of every hun-
dred who give it a fair and faithful trial
IPs sure to help It's almost sure to cure
"I had falling of internal organs and had to
go to bed every month; had irregular monthly
periods which would sometimes last ten or
twelve dayi » write* Mrs Alice L Holmes, of
Coolspring Street TJniontown, Pa "Had In-
digestion so bad that I could not eat anything
hardly Dr Pierce's Favorite Prescription and
' Golden Medical Discovery ' cured me"

CONGRESS COUNTS ELECTORAL VOTE
t The ceremony of counting the electoral vote for Presi
dent and Vice-President at the election on the 6th of last
November, took place in -the hall of the House of Repre
sentatives at i o'clock last Wednesday at a joint session of
the House and Senate • Senator Frye, president pro tern of
the Senate, presided over the joint session Upon the con
clusion of the announcement of the vote the tellers formally
ascertained the totals 'Senator Chandler, one of the tellers,
announced the total vote cast as 447, of which William Mc-
Kinley of Ohio, received for President 2925 and William J
Bryan of Nebraska, 155 and of which Theodore Roosevelt of
New York received for Vice-President 292 and Adlai E
Stevenson of Illinois 155 
Tr is said that the, distinguishing characteristic of
Abraham Lincoln was his brilliant common sense Apropos
of the coming election to determine the question of the in
corporation of Jackson, the Ledger suggests that both sides
dismiss overdrawn and contorted arguments and meet on the
ground of common sense and candidly and conscientiously
reason together By doing this harmony instead of dissension
will prevail The object of the incorporation is solely for
the betterment of every individual within the corporate limits
of the proposed city It is for the purpose of enabling the
citizens within said limits to protect themselves from unsani
tary conditions now existing and to repair and keep in excel
• lent condition the streets and sidewalks of the city In the
opihion_of many good citizens, if these beneficial, changes are
made, every~ piece of property in the city will be enhanced in
value Several of the heaviest property owners in the pro
posed limits, strenuously oppose incorporation becauseit will
increase their tax rate Those in favor of incorporation say
that this will be no hardship for those who have an abundance
and to spare, and that such people should not only be willing
but anxious to devote of their abundance a little for so great
a benefit to the poorer  citizens They say that such an
argument against incorporation is tantamount to putting
filthy lucre in- the scale with health and cleanliness and
therefore unbecoming the civilization of the twentieth
century As a matter of fact, the real hardship will fall on
the poor man who simply owns* his own homePersonal An increase
in the tax-rate will mean something to him, but to the
wealthy citizen, with an income of many dollars a day, the
slight increase will mean nothing at all— a mere bagatelle in
fact Again, the rich, who are' well housed, well clothed and
<^well l fedJ !Personal a^m ! srlitei^conditi6S?"pKysically-to- withstand the'
inroads of disease brought about by the filthy condition of
the town, and hence do not feet the crying need of a speedy
reform in that direction, but • the poorer classes realize the
menace to their own and their children's health, and feel that
what they will save in doctor's bills, when the city shall have
been freed from cesspools and pestilential putrefaction, will
pay~the extra tax ten times over
Geo W Peckj the famous, author of "Peck's Bad Boy,"
ex-Governor of Wisconsin and all around good fellow, is
back in harness, having made a special engagement as editor
of the Comic Supplementjof the New York World,' which has
beenenlarged to eight pages, making it the biggest comic
weekly in America It is safe to say that no matter how big
the Supplement is, it is none too big for Geo W Peck His
connection with that publication should increase its circula
tion 'enormously s and no, doubt will Mr Peck kept the
whole reading, world, in ; a paroxysm of button-bursting
laughter for years, and when he gets at it again the seams
of the garments will need looking after as well as the buttons
Mr Peck is better' than a medicine May his funny vein
never give out, and-may he laugh the people of the Empire
State into a mood for making him their Governor, if they
ever decide to again exalt one of his political persuasion
The investigations of the Paris Commission and the
Chinatown dens of iniquity, affords the respective Legislative
committees, appointed for that purpose, more or less notoriety
and a little extra high living at the; taxpayers' expense, and
that appears; to be about all the investigations will amount
to So far the "Mare's nest" promised in both cases has not
beerifoundj'and'at this writing, to a lay member, there seems
to be no grist in the mill, or if there is the mill is not capable
of grinding it That there is ground for investigation in both
cases seems to be the opinion of the masses, but that the in
vestigations will prove of little or no benefit to the masses
seems equally true The general public has very little faith
in the investigations
jThe Tubliimne "Prospector" by Albert P Hoyt, is a
late production and well deserving a place in the newspaper
ranks We are in receipt of Vol i No 3, which is creditable
in every respect It is a neat six-column folio, well filled

Particular Attention Has Been Given to
the Gold Mines of Amador
County
ARGONAUT MINE
 One mile north of Jackson, adjoining
the Kennedy on the south The in
clined shaft commenced in 1893 has now
reached a depth of 1750 feel, at which
• point it was stopped by an injunction
of the court, pending- a settlement of
litigation with the Kenm-ily Company
Above this level the mine has produced
a large amount of ore, which has been
crushed in a 40-stamp mill with large
profit The shaft not being sunk on
the vein, a series of raises have been
driven, which prove this vein to be
Continuous from tho surface croppings
to the lowest workings The mine' is
equipped with a heavy hoisting plant,
capable of working to a depth of 2000
feet
 # # * *
* KENNEDY MINE
-It Is 1 mile north of Jackspn, adjoin
ing the Argonaut on tin- north This
property has been repeatedly described
in former reports of the Stale Mining
Bureau, but as it is one of the most
prominent mines in the State, it merits
further mention Tim mine has been
worked continuously sinco" 1885, when
work was resumed at a depth of 750
feet, to its prtweut depth of 2300 feet
vertical About 36,000 tons of ore 'have
been crushed annually for the past
fourteen years, at an appioximale cost
of $450 to $500 per ton which includes
the cost of ruining, *u'|i|>livs, insurance,
taxes,' suporlntebiii-uce, pun-huso of
property, dead work and new work
The distribution of ore-shoots in the
Kennedy-Argonaut vein is of consider
able importance to miners along the
Gold Belt, as in these extensive work
ings it has been shown that ore-bodies
are, not absolutely continuous, either
longitudinally or in depth, and that
workings can be driven over the top
and along either side of an ore-shoot,
and bepsath it, jn fact completely 'sur
rounding it, in a barret) ps-ure There
are pre-sboots in \,he Kennedy Mine
that do not approach within several
hundred feet of the surface On the
2100-foot level a new shoot was recently
discovered which started on the west
- or foot wall (diabase), dipping at an
angle of approximately 40 degrees east
ward with a trend to ibe southward,
which is contrary to the usual trend of
ore-shoots in this mine The main
north shoot is wholly distinct and
separate from that on the south, and
it is also distinctly different in char
acter' At the south end of the south
shoot, several small veins come in from
the hanging-wall side, uniting with
the main fissure, and these gradually
jpuild up the large south ore-body
The principal feature of interest at
the Kennedy Mine at present is the
new east shaft The object of this ex
pensive piece of work is to make the
large bodies of low-grade ore exposed
by development in the mine available,
at a decreased cost This shaft bas
been sunk through hard greenstone at
a rate approaching three feet per day
This was accomplished by the use of
four machine drills, working three
shifts Arrangements were so made
that the timber gang could work un
interruptedly while drilling was in pro
gressibelow The machines are set on
two bars disposed near the end of the
I shaft, and after having been set in place
II "a f iijl' rpund pf holes is put in, from 28
H tp 35 in number, without taking down
II the machines The holes are drilled
I from h to 6 feet vertically '

CENTRAL EUREKA MINE
This property adjoins the South
Eureka on tho north, half a mile south
of the town of Sutter Creek This
mine, after an idleness»of many years,
was reopened by a new company in the
fall of 1895 There were several shafts
on the property at that time, the deep
est being the south shaft, down 700
feet Since that time the shaft has
been continued to a depth of 1700 feet
and a number of long levels opened
At about the 1000-foot level, several
narrow and short shoots of high-grade
ore were developed As depth was at
tained and levels driven out, these ore
shoots were found to lengthen and in
crease in width while maintaining their
values, until in the deepest portion of
the mine the several short shoots have
united, forming a single long shoot
At this writing (January, 1900), the
Central Eureka Mine is one of great
promise The vein is the most simple
in geological structure of any extensive
ly developed mine on the Central Lode
It consists practically of a single fissure
cutting in strike and dip the black
tufaceous slates and amphibolite schist
which form its walls ' The mine has
certain peculiarities, which are notice
ably persistent, One of these is the
firmness and regularity of the hanging
wall The wall Is not absolutely
straight in strike, but rolls more or less
itr a series of long swells The gouge,
which is always found on the foot-wall
side, also has a sinuous course, swing
ing towai'd and away from the hanging
wall When at some distance from the
hanging-wall little or no 'ore occurs in
the fissure,' but upon its approach to
the hanging--vall tho long lenticular
masses of quartz which constitute these
ore-bodies, begin to form 'Another
feature of the vein is found in the in
creasing mineralization pf the rock
forming the hanging-wall upon near
ing an ore-shoot

TEACHERS' INSTITUTE OF AMADOR
PROF GEO A GORDON SPEAKS
OF ITS IMPORTANCE
The Benefit to the Teachers— The Insti-
tute May Be Held at the State
University This Year
The law requires that the teachers
of each county in California shall be
convened at least  once each year for
the purpose of holding a teachers'
institute 
That the schools have derived very
great benefit as a result of these insti
tutes, is beyond question "As is the
teacher so is the school," has often
been uttered This being true, by the
teacher's being made more proficient
in their ability to impart information,
the school will receive a direct benefit
A teachers' institute is a success just
in proportion to the opportunities that
it Affords a teacher to better fit herself
for the discharge of her duties in the
school room
It is not supposed that the only time
that the teacher should devote to self
improvement, will be during her at
tendance upon the iustituto Go to the
highest institution of learning, as well
as to the lowest, and you will find that
the professor obtains a leave of absence
in order that he may go to some other
educational institution for the purpose
of gaining broader information whereby
he may keep abreast of the progress in
educational lines The farmer, the
mechanic, the doctor, the lawyer, has
this to do if he may be considered pro
gressive It is essential to success in
any calling whatsoever
The teacher of the elementary school
is greatly encouraged through the
beneficence of tho law makers in that
they have provided that the teacher
is entitled to her salary during the time
that she is in attendance at the insti
tute The salary, undoubtedly, is in
tended as a reimbursement to the
teacher for the expense that she has
had to meet during the time that she
was in attendance ~o ,
For this beneficence the teacher
ought to endeavor earnestly to glean
every benefit to be derived j from op
portunities that the institute affords
The law prpvides that $20000 may
be taken from the school fund of the
county and that 50 per cent may be
taken from the Teashers' Institute and
Library Fund to defray the expenses
of the Institute If the institute is held
at the State University, at least $20000
of this money will be saved to Amador
County Therefore, there will be less
money to be raised by taxation, hence,
a lower tax rate 
Could any thing better be done to
bring Amador County to the attention
of the inside world than the holding of
the Institute at the University of Cali
fornia would do?
It is a business principle that money
invested shquld yield a profit and that
the greater the profit the better the
investment With this principle in
mind and with a determination to strive
to bring abput tb,e greatest advance
ment in the schools of Amador County
that it may be ppssible tq bring about,
there has for months been considered
the plan of hpldiog the teachers' insti
tute at the State University under the
management of Qr Elmer E Brown
who is at the head of the department
of pedagogy of said University
The teachers of the county, being
most vitally interested, were the first
to be consulted Each teacher was
talked to individually in regard to the
plan of holding the institute at the
State University, wjth the result that
every teachpr fa vpred holding it there
State Superintendent, Thos J Kirk,
was next seen and his hearty endorse-,
ment of the plan was obtained
Then the tjniversity people were ap
proached to ascertain whether or not
they would favor us and were assured
by them that every effort would be
exerted to make the institute one of as
direct and of as great benefit to the
schools of Amador County as would be
in their power to make it ' \ [
Before arriving at a final determina
tion tp call the' teachers' to ' convene at
the State University, a communication
has been addressed to the trustees of
the various school districts of the
county asking them tp sanction the
plan Complete rej,iirn§ | are daily ex
pected  Up to this writing, thirty-five
different Boards of Trustees have re
ported favorably— a few are yet to be

THE PRESTON SCHOOL
Judge Cook Declines to Bend Bernstein to
Ban Quentin
An investigation of the methods em
ployed at the Preston School of In
dustry at lone was begun in Judge
Cook's court in San Jj^-ancisco on Fri
day of last week, when the application
of the directors of that institution for
the sending of Benjamin Bernstein to
State's priaon was taken up for con
sideration
Bernstein was sent to Preston school
on January 13, 1897 Subsequently the
administration building was set afire
and Bernstein admitted that be had
fired the structure He made his
escape from the school, but was cap
tured and returned ' The directors de
clared him to be incorrigible and the
court was requested to send him to a
penal institution
David Hirschberg, who was, superin
tendent of the school at the time of the
fire, testified that Bernstein was forced
to confess that he applied the match in
order to escape thrashings at the hands
of Alfred J Heeth, the tailor at the
school Bernstein denied that he set
fire to the building and told Hirschberg
that Heeth forced him to confess to
the deed
 The present Superintendent of the
school, C D Riddick, said he believed
the boy to be so bad and so depraved
that there was no  possible chance of
his being reformed Both former
superintendent • Hirschberg and his
wife, however,  make an entirely op
posite statement Hirschberg said it
would be the ruin of the boy to send
him to the penitentiary Mrs Louise
Hirschberg, who had been matron of
the school for three years, said that
she- thought the boy was as good as the
average boy in  the school She be
lieved that he was sullen at times be
cause he brooded over what he con
sidered an injustice in sending him to
the school During these sullen fits he
was not easily managed, but at other
times ,he was faithful and a good
worker She believed that if he was
permitted to go on parole he would
make a good and upright man
'  In summing up the case Judge Cook
saidPersonal "The boy has been confined for a
long time in the reform sch-jpl, and I
believe so long as tq b,e a dotrjraent, to
the school |t is not for the best in
terests of the schpfll that he b,e kept
there, but I hardly feel that I would
be justified in sending him to the peni
tentiary at present I think the boy
ought tq be given an opportunity to
show that he means to refqrm This
conviction shall rem,a}a as a- weapon in
the hands of the Cpurt and \ shall con
tinue the sentence frqm month to
month for the remainder pf the year
which he has to serve, If he shall be
found to have committed any crime
during that time I shall give him a
most severe sentence" 
Skip Went to the Bottom
One day last week an accident oc
curred at the new shaft of the Keystone
mine at Amador City, and four men
narrowly escaped death It appears
that the skip was at the cellar of the
shaft ready tq be lowered D A
Lambert and Will Npriningtpn were
on the skip waiting tp tie lowered
Lambert got off tp got a rope and
Normington stepped off a moment
after Immediately th,e skip darted
downward, Personal Personal ;K\
John Gill and partner were at work
timbering the shaft some distance
down and heard the unusual noise, and
stepped' aside No sooner had the
men stepped to the sides of tho shaft
than the skip shot between them, and
on to the bottom of the shaft In
some manner the engineer lost control
of the engine, and ' not only did the
skip go to the bottom but it carried
about 50 feet of slack cable with it
Fortunately no qne was even, scratched,
the scare evidently being enough
An accident was narrowly averted in
the old Keystone shaft the same day
The engine used at the new shaft of
the Keystone had been used for several
years in the sawmill of the company
It is said that it was the first engine of
its kind put up in this county It was
made in the east for thp Key stone Com
pany in 1868 "It is in excellent condi

The meeting ; was then adjourned
until 2 o'clock the following afternoon

Will A Newcum was then appointed
to make tbe necessary affidavit and so

The meeting was then adjourned to
await the call of the committee
gome StarJet Circula|eiJ
Whether the people who are circu
lating tho story are doing so from lack
of information or from maliciousness
the writer cannot say, but, neverthe
less, it is being told that the municipal
officers of incorporation pf the sixth
class recej ye high salaries out of the
money collected therein The facts are
that there are no stated salaries or
commissions to bo paid to a^y pf the
officers The fi^e men, constituting the
board of trustees are by tho law pro
hibited from receiving any compeusa
tion whatever — Sec 85,5, Centura,! Laws
of California, "The members of the
board pf trustees shall receive no com
pensation whatever" Rptytiyp to the
other elept^ve fltfloers the same section
says that they shall receive at stated
times a compensation to be fixed by
ordinance by the board of trustees, the
same not to be increased or diminished
after their election or during their
term of office
Hence the matter of payment for
salaries Qr compensations is entirely in
the hands of a board of trustees In
the event of the proposition to in
corporate Jackson carrying the trustees
whq are elecftd at tl^e same election
will have the duty pf fixing the com
pensation of the tpwn c^rk» ft? the
marshal and of the treasurer, the only
electlvo officers who according to law
can receive any compensation what
ever
The statements referred to in the
first lines of this article are thus seen
to be either mal\c,ip,u | sness'o 1 r the result
of misintormxtion, either of which is
inexcusable when it Is so easy to ascer

As to taxation— A story has t^lsp
been circulated Jh a t ft VY e *"y high
municipal tax could be levied and col
lected, a tax qf itself iquch larger than
our present county qnd gtftte tftx ; The
same law, Sec 882, Art ix, says that
the board of trustees have power to
levy and collect, annually, a property
tax which shall not exceed seventy-five
cents on each one hundred dpllars
The limit i^ "^ oen^s "pi}" "does any

that a board of trustees pf five citizens
of this tqwn yybo, cgul^i pOjSsibjy he

A Fanny Surprise
This story Is told by a man who dis
likes nothing so much as to be asked
questionsPersonal "My little girl is very fond
of seashells," he said, "and having
been called to Atlantic City on busi
ness oue day, 1 took advantage of the
opportunity to run down to the beach
to see if I could pick up a few j I was
strolling along the sand, gathering a
few shells and pebbles, which I placed
In my handkerchief, when along came
one of those old idiots who ask ques
tions with their mouths which theli
eyes could answer
 "He smiled upon me and saidPersonal "Fin*
day, isn't It? Are you gathering shells 7
" 'No' I snapped back, saying th
first thing that popped Into my mind,
'I'm looking for a set of false teeth 1
lost while In bathing'
"He expressed his sympathy, and
then his face lit up as his eye caught
sight of a pink and white object on the
sand 'Well I declare! Here they are
nowT he exclaimed, and, sure enough,
he picked up a set of false teeth lying
right at his feet I was too surprised
to do anything but grab them and put
them In my pocket The funny part of
It Is that I never had a tooth pulled In
my life" I wonder who that false set
belongs to"— Philadelphia Record
The Diseased Rich at Baden-Baden
A great deal of grandeur always
makes me homesick It Isn't envy I
don't want to be a princess and have
the bother of winding a horn for my
outriders when I want to run to the
drug store for postage stamps, but
pomp depresses me Everybody  was
strange, foreign languages were pelt-
Ing me from the rear, noiseless flunkies
were carrying pampered lap dogs with
crests on their nasty, little embroid
ered blankets, fat old women with epi
lepsy and gouty old men with scrofula,
representing the aristocracy at Its best,
were being half carried to and from ta
bles, and the degeneracy of noble Eu
rope was being borne In upon my soul
with a sickening force The purple
twilight was turning black on the dis
tant bills, and the silent stars were
slowly coming into view Clean, health
giving Baden-Baden, In the valley of
the Oos, with Its "beauty and Its pure
air, was holding ont her arms to all the
disease and filth that degenerate riches
produce— Lilian Bell In Woman's Home
