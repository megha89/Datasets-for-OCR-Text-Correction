NAPOLEON'S FOLLIES
The Climax Came With the Senseless
liiyuslon of Russia
Of all Napoleon's Insanities, for they
were nothing less, the climax was the
inasion of Russia What motie can
he hae had for this, saing delirious
ambition, and, what was also undoubt
edly strong in him, sheer loe of the
bloody game of war? He eidenly
reckoned on encountering the Russian
army of defense nearer the frontier,
Winning an Austerlitz or a Jena, dictat
ing terms as he had dictated them to
Austria or Prussia, and returning to
Paris in triumph He was deceied in
the character of his enemy He tried
in aiu to force a battle at Smolcnsko
The Russians instead of fighting him
near the frontier retreated before him,
gae up their country to his raages,
compelled him to make a march in
which' he lost a great part of his enor
mous host and after handling him
ery seerely at Borodino eacuated
Moscow, leaing it In* flames They
then refused to treat with him He
had  consequently to decamp without
haing proided for retreat or subsist
ence He lost almost his entire army
in the wintry wastes and but for the
extraordinary conduct of Kutusoff in
letting him and his guard pass unop
posed would himself hae fallen into
the hands of the enemy This error
was on a far more Imposing scale and
more tragical than any blunder of
Beaulieu or Mack But was It less of
a blunder or less of a detraction from
the reputation of the man of action or
een from that of the commander? It
is frightful to think what power a
despot has for eil There was prob
ably not a soul on either side, saing
Napoleon himself, who desired the
Russian expedition— Gold win Smith In

The Green Sea
There is no sea to which the name
green sea is applied'in topography, but
the term is used as descriptie of parts
of the ocean with appropriate signifi
cance
Where the gulf stream is deflected
from Newfoundland toward the Azores
is the Sargasso sea, the surface of
which is a mass of floating seaweed
Its popular nnnie among sailors is the
Green sea nowadays, and In earlier
times it was noticed with astonishment
by Columbus and his sailors, while its
weed clad waters were called by others
the seaweed meadows
A part of the Persian gulf is also
known by this name on account of 8
remarkable strip of iidly green wa
ter which is seen along the Arabian
coast
Many other large tracts of the ocean
assume this distinctie tint, which may
be due either to the presence of multi
tudes of microscopic plants or liing
atoms or to the depth or density or
saltness of the water itself
Why Her ancing; ragged
An athletic young man, with a fine,
strong physique, danced with a young
woman of some 200 pounds in a illage
not far west of Rahway, N J He no
flped that the dancing was uphill work
and wiieii It was oer sank into a chaif
in the Incipient stages of exhaustion
The young woman looked thoughtfully
across the shining surface of the floor
and threw a glance of inestigation at
the corner where the punch bowl stood
"oesn't it strike you that the floor Is
ery sticky tonight?" she inquired
The young man gallantly denied
thinking so
"It seems so to me," the young wo
man obsered Then she looked down
at her foot, protruding from a silken
flounce, and exclaimedPersonal
"Why, J'a goj my rubbers on!"—

SPEECHES THAT LIVE
Oratorlc Triumphs That Stand the
Test of Rending?'
Tt is often said that if a speech reads
well it is not a good speech There
may be some truth in if The reader
cannot, of course, get the impression
which the speaker conoys by look and
tone and gesture He lacks that mar
eloi\sinfluence by which in a great
assembly the emotion of eery indiid
ual soul 13 multiplied by the emotion of
eery other The renOrr can pause and
dwell upon the thought If there be a
fallacy, he is not hurried away to do
something rise before he can detect it
So, also, his more careful and deliber
ate criticism will discoer offenses of
style and taste which pass unheeded in
a speech when uttered But still the
great oratorlc triumphs of literature
and history stand the test of reading In
the closet as well as of hearing in the
assembly Would not Mark Antony's

LITTLE BARBAOS
fhe Island Contains About tse
Proudest People on Earth
None of the great nations of the
earth is half so proud of itself as the
jlttle colony of Barbados, a mere speck
in the Caribbean, which calls Itself
"the little England of the tropics"
Alone of all England's West Indian
isles, Barbados has belonged to Eng
land eer since It was first colonized
by white men It has neer been con
quered by the enemy, as the others
hae been This fact ' naturally gies
the Barbadians a good conceit of them
seles and indeed makes them Juat
about the proudest people on earth
When just before the Crimean wai
England wns hesitating whether she
should attack Russia the Barbadians
sent this message to the cabinetPersonal
"Go ahead on't be afraid Barba
dos is behind you"
King George was offered an asylum
by "little England" when Napoleon
Bonaparte proposed to Inade Eng
land
"If you were drien from England,"
the Barbadians wrote, "come here You
will be safe with us to protect you"
When England was suffering hei
worst reerses in South Africa the
Barbadians were not worried They
knew that if matters really reached a
crisis "Barbados would go In and finish
the business," as one of their newspa
pers seriously put It

MASTERS OF MUSIC
THE GREAT COMPOSERS AN THEIR
PECULIAR METHOS OF WORK
Eccentric Habits, as a Rule, Are
Linked Wltli This Phase of Genius
llnjrtn'a ress Suit and Sapphire
' ninsr and eethoen'* Wild Walks
All the great musical composers had
their own peculiar ideas and manner
ef working They had their peculiar
traits, their moods, their eccentric hab
its, such as are generally said to mark
the genius In "Musical Education" M
Larignnc tells of their peculiarities
"Haydn was a ery early riser," he
write*, "and yet he neer worked ex
cept In full' dress, in which he was
like He began by shaing
himself carefully,  powdered himself
and ||ut on his finger a certain ring, a
sapphire, j 1 beliee,  surrounded with
brilliants, which; had been gien him
by too; great Frederick, unless it was
Prince Esterhazy That done,' be shut
himself up in a quiet room and wrote
for seeral consecutie hours, fie or
blx, without stopping
"Mozart, the gentle and pious Mo
zart, was sometimes less particular,
and composed a little eerywhere and
under all conditions Happily the
ideas came often enough and pursued
him een into the restaurants of Vien
na, Prague and Munich, where he was
ery fond of playing billiards and
smoking a pipe and composing in his
bead
"Rossini composed almost constantly
and In all ways, rarely at the piano,
most often In the eening or at night,
and, like Mozart, often found Inspira
tion in a carriage or post chaise In
the Irregular Joltings of these ehicles
he perceied rhythm, and of these
rhythms melodies were born There is
no doubt that he would hae found
them in the trepidation of the railroad
if he had dared to try, but he had such
a dread of this mode of locomotion that
no one was eer able to induce him to
set foot In a car
"Gluck composed iolently gesticu
lating, walking up and down and act
ing all his characters, often in the open
air, on the lawn, In a garden
"Beethoen also undoubtedly found
a powerful auxiliary to Inspiration in
motion and walking Whateer the
season, eery day after dinner, which
was at 1 o'clock, according to the Vien
nese custom, he set out for a walk,
and with big strides twice made the
circuit of the city of Vienna Neither
cold nor heat nor rain nor hail was able
to stop him Then it was that his heat
of fancy attained its full ardor He
would enter a restaurant, sit down for
an instant and ask the stupefied waiter
for the bill, without haing brderSb
anything His clumsiness was pro
digious He usually broke eerything
he touched Not a single piece of fur
niture In his house, and any article of
alue less than anything else, was safe
from his attacks, and many times his
ink pot fell into the piano by which he
was working, which, religiously pre
sered in 'the museum at Bonn, still
retains its Indelible traces Although
he had always lied in the midst of the
high Viennese aristocracy, in which
drawing room dances were Jield in
high honor, he neer succeeded In danc
ing in time '<•
1 "Herold composed while walking,
humming or singing, often in the
Champs Elysees, and often passed his
best friends by without recognizing
them
"Gounod composed especially at the
table, or at least In his bead When he
Wrote, eerything was absolutely clear
in his brain His manuscripts pro%
this
"Wagner liked to write standing up
before a large table desk like the cash
desks In the shops His scores were
written without erasures, in a superb
calligraphic hand, admirable for Its
clearness and firmness and worthy of
a professional copyist
"Berlioz, who played no instruments
but the' guitar, flute and flageolet, nec
essarily worked at the table
"Franck, who was the head \of a
school, scarcely composed at all till
after ft o'clock in the eening, ; ;•*;'
"Meyerbeer wrote In a regular man
ner In the eening, and his serant bad
orders to drag him away from the
piano at the stroke of midnight Schu
mann would not admit that any one
could write otherwise than at a table
Mendelssohn made much use of the
piano and preferred to work in the
morning Auber generally worked at
night and ery late, till 2 or 3 o'clock
in the morning, In order to aoid out
side noises
"Haley had a table piano that had
been made for him by Pleyel From
time to time he would draw out his key
board, strike a few chords on it, and
then push it back like a simple drawer
and continue to write
"Boieidleu also wrote at the piano
Felicien aid, not being much of a
pianist, sometimes sought the aid of
his iolin Adolpbe Adam almost al
ways worked at his grand piano, the
right hand side of whose keyboard
was stained with Innumerable splashes
of ink He played eight ten or twele
bars, and then wrote them down Bizet
worked especially In the eening and
still more at night; he often made use
of a piano bureau by Pleyel, like Gou
nod and Haley"
His Gncit,
"Where were they married?"
"I ain't jest sure," answered the
small boy, " 'cause they left me home,
but I guess it was in the steeple"
"In the steeple?"

AN IMPUENT BEGGAR
How Sir Walter Besant Was Cured
of Promiscuous Alntsarlrlnar
It was one of the dally customs ol
Sir Walter Besant to take a wali
through Hyde park, London At the
entrance to the park sat an old beggai
woman whose woebegone appearanc<
caused Sir Walter to stop one day and
drop a copper penny Into her out
stretched hand After a time It be
came a regular habit to speak a word
Ir two to her when giing her the coin
One day, howeer, the old woman
handed him back the penny, sayingi
"Gu me siller or nawthlnk The Idea
of a gent like you giln' a poor old wo
man like me a dirty penny 1 Gu me
siller"
She came close to him and waed hei
arms threateningly Sir Walter started
to go, but she grabbed the lapel of his
coat and screamedPersonal "Gu me siller, yon
rascally rogue! Gu me what you ow
me!"
This drew a crowd, and the noelist
to sae himself threw a handful of
coin among them and during the
scramble escaped
He forgot all about the old hag till
one day, chancing to enter the sam
gate again, he was aroused from a
reerie by her shrill cackle Pointing
him out ,to the bystanders, she
screamed, "That's 'im— the fine rogue
In the long whiskers— the bloke in the
'igh "at!"
This was too much for the author
He broke away with extraordinary
baste and thereafter was pretty thor
oughly cured of promiscuous almsgi
ing
Watching a Spider at Work
Watch a spider spin his web, and I
shall be surprised if you eer kill a
spider again It takes him about an
hour, somewhat less, for he is a mar
elously quick worker, and there is
someching almost terrifying about the
skill with which he works There is
his body, no larger than a match's
head, yet inclosed within that mere
dot of nature, there is an intelligence
which is able first to prospect the area
for his web, then to plan it out like a
geometrician and then to carry out his
plan with workmanlike precision
Meanwhile, too, it must be remember
ed, he is not only doing his thinking
and his weaing, but also spinning the
material for It, all In that mite of a
body But perhaps the uncannlest fea
tureof the whole thing is that the spi
der not merely has his plan dear in big
head, but knows when be has made
mistakes, and you can see him break
ing off misplaced' threads here and
there, making taut slack lines and se
curing shaky connections—Success
 An Inconenient Piano
Lepbld de Meyer of resden, a bril
liant and popular pianist of his day,
was once summoned to play before the
sultan at Constantinople Going thith
er, he borrowed a grand piano from
one of the Austrian secretaries of lega
tion and had It set up In a large recep
tion room at the palace  There he
awaited the coming of the sultan, but
when that Intelligent monarch entered
the room he started back in alarm and
demanded of his attendants what that
monster was standing there on three
legs ^i;Personal
Explanations followed, but were in
ain The legs had to be taken off and
the body of the instrument laid flat on
the floor, and Leopold de Meyer, squat
ting cross legged on a mat went
through his programme as  best he
could in that awkward attitude and
without pedals But the commander of
the faithful was delighted, and when
the last piece was playecl gae the art
ist oer $0,000 as "backsheesh"
A Cared Cherry Stone
r Peter Olier, who lied in Eng
land during the early part of the eight
eenth century, tells of seeing a cared
cherry stone which would be a wonder
een in this age of fine tools and fine
workmanship
The stone was one from a common
Cherry, and upon it were cared the
heads of 124 popes, kings, queens, em
perors, saints, etc Small as they must
necessarily hae been, it is announced
on the I authority of Professor Olier
that with a good glass the heads of
the popes and kings could readily be
distinguished from those of the queens
and saints by their miters and crowns
The gentleman who brought this little
wonder to England purchased it in
Prussia, allowing, the original owner
£5,000 for his treasure Think of it—
$25,000 for a cherry seed!
A Spirit to Be eplored
Just where honorable Industry ends
and aaricious piling up of treasure
begins no one can take it upon himself
to say The spirit howeer, that im
pels a young man to sacrifice all the
nobler aims of life in order to turn a
liberal competence into wealth too
great to be spent (and the giing away
of which, unless carefully regulated, Is
a doubtful good) is certainly to be de
plored—Eliot Gregory in Century
Bankrupt

ey at all
Solicitor— Then why the dickens do
you come to me? Hang it all, man, yoa
are bankrupt!
A Uniersal Custom
"Wheneer I get an umbrella," said
the prudent citizen, "I put my name on
it"
"So do I," answered the man without
a conscience "The person who used td
own it isn't so likely to identify it"

THE AMERICAN' LAUGH
It Is a Valuable Aid la Building Up
Our National Greatness
God's greatest gift to man was the
laugh Without It the human race
would hae wept Itself to death or ex
terminated itself long ago Pathos Is
beautiful; tragedy Is absorbing But
both pathos and tragedy are Instantly
routed by the laugh 
Laughter has sunshine in It  It Is
Warm Learned men hae searched
for the secret of life What Is it but
good humor? That's the secret of life
being worth liing
What Bunehine Is to earth good hu
mor Is to man Take the smile and
the laugh away, and it would be the
end of man
Men can't fight while they enjoy a
Joke eath himself recoils from the
laugh The man in a good humor has
an enormous adantage oer the man
who Is angry Anger Is dark Bitter
ness Is filled with shadow Intoler
ance Is grim and black Prejudice is
blind
Good humor, with the smile and the
laugh, is sunshine In which objects are
plain and distortion disappears and
wherein phantoms become nothing
One reason for America's greatness Is
that, aboe all, it is a nation that
laughs There hae been gay peoples
and friolous nations, but gayety and
friolity, are strangely akin to melan
choly That gay Germany whose na
tional happiness is expressed in song
is clouded by melancholy Sadness
perades the temperament of Germa
nla
And friolous France— how tragic
she becomes— how desperately tragic!
Tbe great American laugh is another
thing Inestigate the American na
tional laugh, and there's a sound, prac
tical something behind it It is neer a
forced laugh It is healthy, igorous,
spontaneous
Empires and powers hae crumbled
and gone to pieces In solemn serious
ness and gloomy grandeur, while Uncle
Sam, with a joke on his lips, forges
ahead— ener Post

COUNTY GOVERNMENT ACT
SUSTAINE
The supreme court has just ren
J dered a decision affirming the con
' stitutionality'o| the county goern
;' ment act of 1901 Some of our ex
Personal changes are laboring under the im
<• pression that itrelates to the new
V county goernmeut act passed by
! the last legislature, and which is now
being tested in the superior court of
 Amador county The truth is, the
'  opinion just gien by the supreme
Personal court has no bearing whateer on
"the issue in which this count}' is in
 terested, and which is now pending
♦in the courts The point raised
 against the law of 1901 was that the
' act did not conform to constitutional
• requirements The act of that year
Scut down the salaries of constables
and other officials in San Joaquin
The officials affected re
fused to accept the lower salaries,
applied for writ of mandate to
i compel the auditor to issue warrants
"in conformity with the old law The
was carried to the highest
J court, which has just decided against
%the officials The issue before the
iPersonal Amador court is entirely different,
namely, whether justices and con
I/stablesI '/stables can demand increased com
pensation for serices under a law
passed during their term of office
PersonalThe state constitution says nothing
"against the lowering of salaries It
 may appear unjust that the emolu
ments of office should be reduced
after a man has been elected The
constitution, howeer, sets forth
certain resered rights of the peo
ple, some things "which the legis
lature'shall not do It is silent
about lowering salaries, and hence
the courts hae declared that the
legislature has control oer the mat
ter On the other hand the supreme
law of the state is ery emphatic in
withholding from the legislatie
body the power to increase compen
sation of electie officers — whether
state, county, or township — during
the term for which they were elected
The last legislature attempted to do
this A quibble has ' been raised
against this way of putting the case
It is claimed that the law merely
changes the manner of compensation
from fees to salary This is a ery
small hole to try to crawl out of
The officials concerned want to draw
salary under the new law for no
other reason than that it holds out
increased pay They may twist and
wiggle as they please, that is what
they are fighting for
A GOO MOVE
At the meeting of the board of
superisors held this, week the dis
trict attorney took action in regard
to road work authorized by the
superisors, the cost of which ex
ceeds $300, which is likely to put a
stop to the practice which has been
followed in this county for a number
of years »The present law makes it
mandatory to let out all work in ex
cess of by contract, after ad
ertising for bids The law in sub
stantially the same form has existed
for years except that the last legis
lature took the matter entirely out
side of the discretion of the super
isors, making it obligatory upon
them to adertise for bids for road
work estimated to cost $300 or oer
It may be stated that nearly all the
work done on the lone road will
come within this proision But
the contract system has been en
tirely ignored The indiidual sup
erisors hae ordered the work done
regardless of this limitation upon
their authority The Ledger has
repeatedly called attention to this
matter, and also to other phases of
road management that might be
changed with adantage to the pub
lic interests uring the past
month a portion of the lone road
has been subjected to the oil treat
ment This work was done, as all
other work has been performed for
years past, without putting it up to
public competition by adertising
for proposals The bills came in for
allowance before the board this
week, and the cost of this improe
ment was far in excess of the $300
limit The district attorney there
upon took a decided stand, and
stated that the law had been iolated
in this respect for a long time, and
that hereafter he would allow no
more bills of this kiud They were
required to let the work by contract,
and persistence in disregarding this
proision had already caused com
ment, and sooner or later was bound
to gie trouble The district attor
ney has charge of this question It
is his duty to look oer the bills be
fore being allowed, and mark them
legal or otherwise according to his
judgment A road bill branded by
him as an illegal claLn would not be
paid by the treasurer, een if it
were passed rby the superisors
The action of Attorney Vi
cini therefore brings this branch of
the road question clearly in issue
The stand he has taken in behalf of
strict compliance with a salutary
law, but a law which has been a
dead letter in this county for years,
will meet with approal by citizens
generally We trust it will lead to
the^ correction also of that other
longstanding abuse of supprisors
putting in lump claims in their own
names for road work done in their
respectie districts This is equally
against the law, and its discontinu
ance is only a question of time
PROTEST AGAINST FOREST RES
ERVATION , ;
Seeral citizens Personal of this county
went to Sacramento Tuesday to file
a protest against the continuance
of the temporary forest reseration
in this county, which was made
about six months ago, and by which
nearly all the timber lands of this
county were withdrawn from entry
The western line of the reseration
extends nearly to Georgetown and
Placerille A written protest
against this extreme reseration has
been signed quite generally ' So far
as we can learn no resident of this
county is in faor of haing such
large tracts resered, although there
is not so much objection to resera
tions in the higher altitudes where
the timber is not aailable for im
mediate use A special agent of the
land department has been sent out
to hear the case, and a decision will
be reached later on  
Our congressional representaties
should oppose this extensie "reser
ation, for it sets aside so large a
portion of the county that its busi
ness affairs would be seriously crip
pled Supply and demand are the
best regulators of the timber When
timber is needed it ought to be cut,
for it rots beyond a certain age In
these Sierras the young timber is
growing again ery rapidly, and
there will be trees again for the peo
ple of the future A great deal of
alarm about the future is absurd
When people searched the Arctic
ocean for whales, because they knew
nothing of kerosene or electricity, it
would hae been argued that the
future might be dark if we neglected
to keep fat whales to make oil for
remote ages We are getting along
all right without the whales, and
our descendants will lie in ten times
the luxury that we possess with half
our effort — all of which may be ery
bad for them— Placeriile Republi

There is more catarrh in this section
of the country than all other diseases
put together, and until the last few
years was supposed to be incurable
For a great many years doctors pro
nounced it a local disease, and prescrib
ed local remedies, and by constantly
failing to cure with local treatment,
pronounced it incurable Science has
proen catarrh to be a constitutional
disease, and therefore requires consti
tutional treatment Hall's Catarrh
Cure, manufactured by F J Cheney

tutional cure on the market It is taken
internally in doses from 10 drops to a
teaspoonful It acts directly on the

A Commendable Act
According to notices published
around town, a special meeting of
Jackson Miners' Union was held Tues
day eening The particular business
that called them together in special
session we are not prepared to state
It is common report on the street, how
eer, that one of the prominent sub
jects of discussion was the socalled
"scab" notices which were posted
around town about six weeks ago
Theso notices hae created a great deal
of aderse criticism They hae also
caused not a little talk in the ranks of
the union members There is a large
and growing element in the camp
aerse to such rabid measures They
realize that the safe course to pursue
in adancing the interests of organized
labor is to show a conseratie and
conciliatory spirit, recognizing the
right of any citizen to join or decline
to join their order as he may see fit,
and that too without in any way sac
rificing his right to earn a liing by
working in the mines To try to bull
doze men into their organization by
threats of blacklisting, or labeling
them as "scabs," or refusing to work
with them, and all sucb extreme steps,
was looked upon as unwise, and calcu
lated to weaken the union by affixing
the seal of public condemnation Hence
this wing endeaored to lead the local
order into paths of safety With the
interests, not only of themseles, but
of the whole community at heart, they
desire to reestablish confidence among
mining inestors by a fair and liberal
policy Some time ago, we are in
formed, an effort was made to hae the
"scab" proclamation rescinded and the
notices taken down It did not succeed
entirely, but the day of grace was ex
tended for another month This per
iod of extension has not more that half
expired Encouraged by their partial
success, these workers haing the true
interests of labor at heart, pressed for
ward in the good work At the meet
ing this week, we are told, a resolution
was passed to rescind the "scab" proc
lamation On Wednesday morning*
the printed notices, which hae disfig
ured the bulletin boards and a number
of business premises in town, were re
moed They were taken down in the
same manner as they were posted p —
by official action Tho Ledger is al
ways willing to gie credit for a com
mendable act, and we do not hesitate
to say that Jackson Union, by this
deliberate and welltimed proceeding,
has done much toward allaying that
apprehension in inestment and busi
ness circles that has gien such a
serious setback to the deelopment of
our resources Reason is again en
throned We hae no doubt this spirit
will continue in the ascendant
No harm can come of a labor organi
zation if properly conducted, with a
due regard for the interests of the out
sider as well as the insider Indeed,
much benefit will accrue to its mem
bfrs when so conducted We hail this
latest moe of the local union, as a
deliberate withdrawal from the path
mapped out when flushed with the idea
of newly discoered power, and a de
termination to exercise it to the limit
In lieu thereof, the olie branch of
peace is extended With this feeling
preailing, the unrest should disappear
and the mining industry hereabouts be
prosecuted with increased energy
Consolidation of Lumber Interests
The lumber interests of Amador
county are being gradually absorbed
by ihe Amador Lumber Company
The company has recently purchased
the stock of lumber in the Allen yard
in Sutter Creek They hae also se
cured a tract of land comprising fie
acres near the Vicini hotel on Sutter
hill Here they will establish a whole
sale lumber yard, from which lumber
will be distributed to all parts of the
county Sheds are now in course of
construction, and teams are hauling
lumber from the mills at Tiger creek
to this point
In Trouble at Sheepranch
Stee Cassella, who is said to be an
Amador City man, is incarcerated in
Jail at San Andreas for a murderous
assault upon a miner named Jack Mor
ris at Sheepranch on Wednesday of
last week Both men work in the
mine They had a quarrel some weeks
before, in which Cassella was worsted
Ho resoled on reenge As Morris
was coming home from work on the
night shift on the morning in question,
he was met by Cassella, who struck
him twice oer the head and once on
each arm with a bar of iron, with
which he bad armed himself for the
occasion It was at first thought that
the skull was " fractured This fortun
ately proed incorrect Cassella fled

Notes From Amador County Mines
Kennedy Picking Up
Kennedy — The cleanup at this
mine for last month was the heaiest
for many months We are not in a
position to state the amount Rumor
has it that it was something oer
$40,000, the product of 70 stamps This
is far better than the aerage yield for
the past two years
Grand Prize — This mine, tho
property of G S Andrews, Is situated
in Pioneer district, adjoining the Horn
mine The first shipment of ore from
this claim took place this week, con
sisting of one car load, containing 13
tons It was sent to Selby smelting
works The ore came from below the
tunnel leel Mr Andrews accom
panied the shipment in person
Butte Basin— WE Stewart in
forms us that work is to be started at
once on the Butte basin grael claim
The intention is to sink the shaft 40
feet deeper by means of a horse whim,
and prospect the grael at that depth
Work will be commenced early next
week Rich prospects, ranging as high
as $6 to the pan, hae been obtained
from this basin, and it is bolieed that
richer spots will be found below exist

el Monte — The annual meeting
of stockholders was held in Jackson
July 6 The old board of directors
were elected for the ensuing term, as
followsPersonal F A Voorheis, Geo 1,
Wright, Richard Webb, B C O'Neil
and C O'Neil The tunnel is still in
the hardest kind or rock, and progress
is therefore slow About 45 feet pro
gress has been made during the past
month, with 180 feet more to make be
fore reaching the point where it is ex
pected to encounter the ledge It was
decided to discoutinue work on this
tunnel for the present, and crush some
300 tons of ore on the dump, should it
proe of paying quality After this
work on the tunnel will no doubt be re
sumed
Sand Pile Mme — Extensie works
are being, erected at tbis mine near
Forest Home The material constitut
ing the mine consists of immense accu
mulations of tailings from the Plymouth
Consolidated mills There are hun
dreds of thousands of tons of these
tailings It is said that assays gie a
alue of from $2 to $3 per ton in gold
With such a alue, there certainly
ought to be some way of working them
at a profit To this end  Fricot is
now putting up works for their treat
ment by the cyanide process He has
already spent thousands of dollars on
the plant, and thre is much work to
be done bofore it gets in running order
efender— Situated about six miles
north of West Point, In Amador Less
than four years ago F B Joyce began
with a tenfoot  hole and a working
bond, his first adenture in mining
When about 80 feet deep the ore justi
fied a mill, and a second band one of
four stamps was put on, and with this
he took out $40,000 in sinking 300 feet,
and running leels each way about 150
feet, with no stoping About 150 tons
were shipped to Selby, running from
$50 to $130 Now he has a new 10
stamp mill, and is running on reseres
aboe 300 feet, and will resume sinking
Quite a burg has grown up at efen
der He has a store, teams, house,
postoffice, and a schoolhouse used as a
church also After the mill was built
the mine paid for itself, and with a
good profit His success, starting with
a prospect, makes a good object lesson

FOURTH IN JACKSON
Baseball Game and ance
The fourth in Jackson passed off in
the quietest manner known for years
There was nothing in the way of liter
ary exercises nor amusements of any
kind in town Indeed, the day would
hae passed off like any other day had
it not been for Frank Burgin, who,
seeing that the citizens were not dis
posed to take any action looking to the
regular obserance of the day, ar
ranged a baseball game between the
Jewel Bourbons and the Lodi team
Game was called in the afternoon, on
the new grounds on wyer's hill It
drew a large crowd, not only of town
folks, but many from the surrounding
country The outcome was a bad de
feat for the Jackson players The
isitors proed themseles experienced

A Strike in Tuolumne County
The miners affiliated with the West
ern Federation of Miners in Jamestown
district went out on strike last Friday,
because of the employment of a few
nonunion miners The strike inoles
four mines— the Jumper, Golden Rule,
Santa Ysabel and App These prop
erties employ about 300 men They
embrace the principal working mines
of Tuolumne county The union posted
up notices fie weeks ago, similar to
the famous notices that were posted
throughout this county, stating that
all who failed to become members of
the union by a specified date would be
regarded as scabs Seen men failed
to send in applications for membership
One was employed at the Jumper, two
at Santa Ysabel, and four'at the App
The union miners decided that they
would not work with them, and struck
The strike means either of two thingsPersonal
to force these men to join the union, or
force the mine owners to discharge
them It is a clear cut issue of all
union or all nonunion employes The
outcome will be awaited with much
interest It is a contest of ital im
portance as affecting not only the
mineral industry of the district par
ticularly concerned, but' of the entire
mother lode region
Want Only One Union
The Western Federation of Miners
is not at all pleased oer the organiza
tion of the engineers and other em
ployes aboe ground in connection with
the mines of this county as a labor un
ion affiliated with American Federation
of Labor There has been some feel
ing created thereby The Western
Federation is anxious to get the engin
eers and other top men to join their or
ganization These men, who hae
already identified themseles with the
new organization, are contented with
their lot, and manifest no disposition
to change front The friction, we are
told, has become quite acute at the
mines in Amador City district during
the past week A representatie of the
Western Federation acting under in
structions from headquarters, made an
effort to win them oer to his
side The engineers of the Keystone,
Bunker Hill and Fremont were waited
upon, and urged to join the Federation
A letter from the secretary of the en
er headquarters was shown as author
ity for the moe to bring them Into the
orthodox camp The engineers, how
eer, do not appear to take kindly to
the initation They were ery em
phatic in declaring their preference to
remain where they are This latest
moe has caused quite a stir, and is
likely to lead to trouble if pressed to
extremes
We learn that the engineers hae
been gien twentyone days to join the
Western Federation A failure to join,
as things now stand, means a refusal
to work with those adhering to the
American federation Three weeks,
howeer, will afford ample time for re
flection*, aad the sober second thought
to gain supremacy

NOTES OF THK AY
The main feature of the racing pro
gram was a "catch as catch can" sprint
between "Peanuts" Harden of Amador
and F" Giannini of rytown Good
time was made, but Giannini "wasn't
in it" The race was witnessed by only
a few of the best of us
A heayweight Austrian stepped on
F LeMoin's toe while in the married
men's race, and now Fred is nursing
the sore member
Jimmy Johnnie and ick Allen came
from Amador to help swell the crowd
The names of John S ais and T
Honeychurch hae been stricken from
the roll for not being present
Eddie Giannini led for a while in the
blue rock shoot, but was taken with a
bad spell of rattles and allowed A
Grainger to take the fie dollar prize
an Bona left his shooting eye at
home in his game bag
The trotting race, that was to be,
between LeMoin's "Brewster," Mc
Wayne's "Black Pete" and Carley's
"Nellie" was declared off on account of
Carley's mare being oer trained
George Jennings is a pretty fast
sprinter for a short distance
I didn't witness the baseball game
but was told that the score was 82 to
something, in faor of the Amador's

fielder, but the Amador's 3ent all kinds

On Wednesday eening, July Bth,
Bon K Breesc of Oakland and Miss
Elizabeth Mabel Wheeler were mar
ried at the home of the bride's parents
on their farm two miles east of Ply
mouth Re S H Phillips performed
the ceremony in the presence of sixty
relaties and inited guests
The sweet strains of Mendelshon's
wedding march ushered the Personal bride,
leaning upon the arm of her father,
into the spacious family sitting ; room,
where she was met by the groom In
a few well chosen words Re Phillips
pronounced them man and wife
U G Spagnoli, a lifelong friend of
the groom, and Miss Mamie Wheeler,
sister of the bride, stood up with the
couple mutually and silently pledging
the hearts of the true friend and sister
A loer of nature has said that "if a
man is wise he is born and reared in
the country " It is equally true, "if a
woman is beautiful she is born and
reared in the country ' ' This from a
friend tells it allPersonal columns, describing
a beautiful dress, a pretty bride or a
handsome groom, would be unnecessary
and out of place
After the ceremony was performed
all present sat down to a bountiful
wedding supper prepared by the bride's
sisters, and an hour or more was spent
in good cheer amid mirth and joy At
midnight Mr and Mrs Breese took
their departure from the old home
stead of the bride They were drien
to Latrobe, from which place the train
was taken for Lake Tahoe, where two
weeks' honeymoon will be spent, after
which they will return to Oakland
their future home Many useful and
beautiful presents were receied It
could not be otherwise True friends
are neer forgotten
Bonny Breese, as be is known by
eery man, woman and child in Ama
dor county, is the pride of our people,
and his conduct through life has de
seringly earned the esteem in which
he is held He is the oldest child and
the only son of the late Raymond
Breese, who died ten years ago while
sering as county clerk His ability
and force of character were recognized
by his father's successor, C L Culbert
the present county clerk Although of
opposite political iews, Bon was gien
a clerkship in the office and when he
reached his majority he was appointed
chief deputy, which position he has
since held, until a year ago, when he
resigned his office to accept a position
as accountant in the Central Bank in
Oakland, which place he now holds,
and is as much  a faorite with his
employers and associates in Oakland
as he was in Amador county uring ail
these years Bon supported and cared
for the loed ones dependent on him,
and educated his sisters as well, thus
enabling them to earn their own liing
and assist in building up a home for
their mother This duty faithfully
discharged another pleasant step in
life is taken and prompts tbis pleasing
story of a true and faithful son and
brother, and last but not least, a lo
ing husband
The bride is one of Amador's popular
natie daughters, and has been a suc
cessful teacher in our public schools
She too has a host of loing and ad
miring friends — the most enduring

TRAINING A LION
A artnsT Performance That Had at
Very Simple Explanation
Not long ago a lion tamer who was
sxhibitlng in a German circus in Hol
land attracted immense crowds at e
ery performance by doing what seemed
to be "the most daring of acts in the
lions' cage He would climb into the
cage with great pieces of meat and
throw it to the roaring beasts The
moment they had leaped upon it he
would spring among them and put his
foot on it The animals would growl
furiously, and then, just as the specta
tors were all waiting breathlessly, ex
pecting that the beasts would tear him
to pieces, they would shrink back,
cowed After be had repeated this ex
citing act for many days an English
man made a wager with him for a big
sum of money that he would not dare
to do it after the lions had been stared
for three days The trainer considered
for a moment and then accepted the
wager, making only the condition that
he be allowed to hae three weeks of
preparation
At the end of three weeks the trainer
announced that he was ready, and the
process of staring the lions began
The Englishman kept guards posted
around the cage day and n)ght to make
certain that not a morsel of food should
be gien to the animals At the expira
tion of the three days all Amsterdam
rushed to the circus The lions were
maddened with hunger,, as any one
could see and hear, for they roared
continually, and their attempts to
break through the bars showed how
angry they had become In the height
of the uproar the trainer entered the
cage with an immense piece of beef in
his arms He tossed it on the floor of
the cage, raised his whip and, 10, not
one lion dared to approach it The
mighty brutes lay crouched, roaring
and growling so hard that their great
frames shook, and each kept his ter
rific yellow eyes fixed hungrily on the
meat But not one of them stirred
The trainer stooped, lifted the beef
and tossed it to them again, and in a
moment the lions were in a great
tawny ball, rending and snarling and
tearing, with blood from the mangled
beef spurting all oer the cage The
Englishman paid his bet and then tried
to find out how the lion tamer had ac
quired such wonderful control oer his
beasts At first the man would not
tell, but at last he consented to ex
plain it uring the three weeks' pe
riod of preparation he had always
stared the lions from the ery begin
ning Then, on the fourth day, he
would enter the cage with a piece of
beef which had been soaked in kero
sene oil The lions would no "sooner
pounce upon it than they would shrink
away, sickened by the ' stench Then
he would throw them a fresh and good
piece of beef, which they would deour
In a moment The lions soon became
so accustomed to expecting that the first
piece of beef that was thrown to them
was not good that at the end of three
days they would not een moe from
their corners when the trainer threw it
on the floor of the cage They would
not try to eat anything except the sec
ond piece So the daring trick had a
ery simple explanation— Washington

A Teat of Reflnement
The truest test of refinement is a
uniform regard for the welfare and
Interests and feelings of others There
Is a refinement which is by education,
but in each case the sure indications
of refinement are the same You cau
recognize the difference between those
who hae and those who lack refine
ment by their bearing in a crowd In
deed this difference is easier perceied
in a street car or in a market or in a
thronged highway than in a drawing
room A person of true refinement
takes up the less room and claims the
less concession and is readier to yield
position than an unrefined person The
way in which a man carries a cane or
umbrella in a crowd settles the ques
tion in his case And again the keeping
of one's market basket in the way, or
out of it, as at the busiest market ho'ir,
is an infallible test of the bearer's in
ner grain And so in many other minor
matters— Philadelphia Ledger
Silk Culture In Italy
About 600 A I> Persian monks first
brought silkworm eggs concealed in
the head of a hollow staff to Constan
tinople Thence silk culture spread in
to Greece A little later conquest car
ried it to Sicily From there to Italy
it was but a step Soil, climate, peo
ple suited it The Industry took root,
grew, throe and continues to this day
The thrifty peasant • manages to get
silk and oil and wine from the same
small holding First he plants his mul
berry trees, sixteen feet each way;
next he prunes the heads Into a hollow
cup and trains his ines all oer them,
and finally around the edge he sets a
shelter of olie trees So all seasons
bring him labor and the reward of it

BRIAL PHOTOGRAPHS
Not Nearly So Many Taken Nowa
days sa There Used to Be
Brides are probably just as beautiful
now as eer they were, but they are
not nearly so anxious to record their
postnuptial loeliness by means of pho
tographs Most photographers say they
are glad of it
"I neer did enjoy taking the pictures
of brides," said a photographer "Like
ell the rest of the world, I loe the dear
creatures, but when it cornea down to
$4 n dozen commercialism tney do not
satisfy my artistic instincts Few brides
take a good picture Somehow their
togs are not becoming A bride is sup
posed to iook superlatiely loely on
her wedding day, but if anybody dared
to tell the truth on the subject that su
perstition soon would be exploded and
the sweet things would realize that, in
stead of looking their best on that oc
casion, most of them are apt to look
their worst It is the same way when
they come to be photographed In their
wedding finery They are either too
pale or too red, and they hae a ner
ous, anxious expression that robs the
face of all good lines for photographic
purposes
"The time was when no bride consid
ered herself really married until she
had arrayed herself in spotless white
and had her picture taken Generally
'he' came with her, and 'he' looked just
about as foolish as she did Goodness,
the trouble I hae had posing brides
and bridegrooms before the camera I
Instead of telling them' to look pleas
ant I always felt like saying, 'on't
look idiotic if you can possibly help it,'
and then I would hae to think up
some deice to keep her from scrouging
down too close agninst his shoulder and
to keep him from responding with a%
equally Inappropriate embrace But
with all my precautions I neer fully
succeeded in preenting their acting
like lunatics The other day when look
ing oer a lot of old negaties I came
across seeral hundred of those senti
mental combinations, and I thanked
my lucky stars that nowadays few
newly mated couples hae the camera

acid from the surrounding air and dis
integrate it in their own cells under
the influence of sunlight In the prick

of the plant— the sucking In of carbon

EXPENSIVE KISSES
Two That Helped to Make Eight
eenth Century History
 In the year 1794 the beautiful and
charming uchess of Gordon raised
that famous regiment of soldiers calli
ed "the Gordon highlanders" by gi
ing each recruit a guinea in gold and a
kiss from her own lips It is notorious
that the regiment was raised to a full
complement quicker than any other
regiment in the British serice But
the highlanders paid well for theli
kiss They were sent immediately to
fight the French, and In their first en
gagement 300 fell, killed and wounded
In the year 1703 a stray kiss was the
means of bringing about a bloody and
expensie war Prince Ferdinand of
Baaria was journeying in a neighbor
ing state One day he isited "the roy
al household," and while there his eye
caught sight of a most beautiful maid
en who happened to be near him He
was so bewitched with her charming
personality that he impulsiely and
thoughtlessly Implanted a kiss upon
her fair cheek She was a princess of
the royal household, which the prince
knew not, neither did he know that she
was an affianced bride and that her be
trothed was near by and saw the
whole affair Angry words and blows
followed A duel was fought and both
principals were seerely wounded ip
lomatic relations between the two king
doms were suspended, and a long and
bloody war ensued, all on account of a
kiss which was paid for most dearly In
blood and treasure
The Mngnet
Thousands of years ago a mineral
haing the strange power of attracting
iron was found in the country ancient
ly called Magnesia, in Asia Minor The
name of this country has gien us the
word "magnet" This mineral, which
is now called the lodestone (notload
stone), attracted the attention of the
curious, and it was discoered that a
piece of iron which had been rubbed
with the lodestone acquired the same
power of attracting iron In other
words, the piece of iron became a mag
net It was afterward found that such
an iron or artificial magnet could be
used like the lodestone Itself to conert
other pieces or iron into magnets by
rubbing StiU more recently a mode
of making magnets by means of elec
tricity was discoered— that is, by
wrapping b piece of insulated wire
many times around the bar and then
causing a current of electricity to pass
through the wire The familiar small
toy magnets are simply steel bars
which hae been rubbed a few time?
against powerful magnets— St Nich

Walking Leaes
Nature's^ law being almost uniersal
so far as 'the protection of the weak
creatures is concerned, it is not at all
wonderful perhaps that she has formed
Insects ' into perfect counterparts of
flowers, leaes, sticks, etc Some of
the "walking leaes," those which are
naties of India, China iuil Japan in
particular, are large, grotesque look
ing creatures, their resemblance being
strikingly like a bundle of yellow
twigs joined together with faded, mac
erated leaes The limbs of this spe
cies of insect are long, slender and
ery twigllke, the coloring being suited
to that particular species of egetation
upon which the deceptie miinicker
subsists
The "walking stick," like the walk
ing leaf, is also ery deceptie as far
as looks go The males hae small,
slender bodies, the legs or arms start
ing from it just as smaller limbs of a
tree or weed start from larger ones
The "walking thorn" of Jaa belongs
to this curious order of insects, as do
also the "deil's horse" and the mantis
The "walking thorn" looks exactly like
the large compound spine of our com
mon honey locust tree, een in color
and general contour
How Eyes Are Tested
The "theory of the optically perfect
eye is that parallel rays of light enter
ing it are brought to a focus on its ret
ina Any deiation from this condi
tion constitutes an error of refraction
and requires for its correction an arti
ficial ariation of the luminous rays
The generally adopted method of de
termining the refraction of the eye is
to use test types placed at such a dis
tance that the rays of light emanating
from them may be regarded in practice
as parallel, and the deiation from par
allelism necessary to correct a refrac
tie error is effected by placing a lens
in front of the eye There are many
other methods of changing the course
of luminous ' rays coming from a test
object, and of these the single conex
lens is the simplest and most often
used in optometry

The Clydesdale Horse
The Clydesdale horse should walk at
a swinging pace of not less than four
miles an hour, and If he wants to trot
he should moe straight and close,
with the points of the hocks turned in

not be wide between the thighs nor
should his fore legs be planted on the
outside of his shoulders, causing him
to walk like a bulldog
