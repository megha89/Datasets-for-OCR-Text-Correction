Apple Pie Order
To feel in apple pie order is a phrase
which dates back to Puritan times— to
a certain Qepzibah Morton It seems
that eery Saturday she was accus
tomed to bake two or three dozen ap
ple pies, which were to last her family
through the coming week These she
placed carefully on her pautry sheles,
labeled for each day of the week, so
that Tuesday's pies might not be con
fused with Thursday's nor those pre
sumably large or intended for washing
and sweeping days eaten when house
bold labors were lighter Aunt Hep
zlbah's "apple pie order" was known
throughout the entire settlement and
rlginated the well known saying

Blood,
We lie by our blood, and on

There is nothing else to lie
When strength is full and
spirits high, we are being re-

  This is health
When weak, in low spirits,
no cheer, no spring, when resl
is not rest and sleep is not

is poor ; there is little nutri-
ment in it.

SAVAGES IN JAPAN
THE HAIRY AINOS AND THEIR RESER-
VATIONS IN THE EMPIRE
Odd Customs Practiced by These
Aboriginal People - of Japan
I'nlqne Styles In Baby Sunn
Their Reaemblance to Oar Indiana
The Ainus, generally known to Amer
icans and Europeans as "the hairy
Ainos," are the only aboriginal people
now liing In Japan They are called
•'hairy" In contradistinction to the
smooth faced Japanese, Koreans and
Chinese Their present home Is In Hok
kaido, or Yesso, the most northerly part
of the empire, although It Is supposed
that in earlier times they occupied
most of the entire country Ancestors
of the Japanese of today found them in
possession and by force of superior
arms and ciilization gradually droe
them to the north, much in the same
way as the saages were drien back
toward the Pacific by Ihe early settlers
in America 
The Ainus lie today pretty much as
the Indians on their reserations in the
west. They are still for the most part
half saage, and the Japanese name
for them, "Yesso," means barbarian
They are-ery skillful in hunting and
fishing, which are their chief occupa
tions They are under the protection
of the imperial goernment and are
entirely separated from the Japanese
The latest census showed that they
number ery nearly 17,000/ Z<^-
Among the many curious customs of
the Ainus peihapstho-4iifi>ntest is their
method of ngjgieir children They
obseryp^t'Tieculiar economy in giing
,  » I nes The Infant must go without a
name until it shows itself worthy of
bearing one If it is sickly and not
likely to lie, it is not considered worth
while to waste a name upon It As
each child must by immemorial custom
hae a brand new name, used by no
one in the community, names are scarce
aud must be guarded If the child
should be gien a name borne by some
oue else, the ghost of tbe former pos
sessor of the name may come back
from the underworld to aenge the
slight Personal  ,
It is customary to take a name from
some incident that occurred at the
child's birth or it Is left to the parents
afterward to choose one for it. Should
the infant come into the world with a
smiling face it might be called Iklshi
maburu, which means a smile, or fond
parents may call it Kamoissage (a
pulling rope of the gods) if they wish
their child to be in the special care of
the gods
From the age of 7 to 10 Ainu children
of either sex hae their heads shaed,
but after 11 they are allowed to hae
long hair and wear the same clothes
as grown persons They wear no cloth
ing unless the weather Is ery cold
The faorite and almost exclusie or
nament is the earring, usually made of
metal What clothing Is worn is made
of straw They neer wear shoes or
other cocring'Tor the feet except as s
great luxury and mark of distinction
on ceremonious occasions
The men carry small knies and to
bacco pouches, and the women carry
small looking glasses and knies The
knife is used as symbolic The maiden
wears it with tbe blade bare, but when
she marries it is worn in a sheath The
women also paint their faces, using a
kind of ink for the purpose
The Ainus lie mostly by fishing and
hunting They hunt the bear and deer,
catch salmon and other fish and grow
potatoes and millet Wheneer they
can get it they eat rice, which they re
gard as the best food, though they do
not raise It themseles Both sexes
smoke tobacco and drink liquor '
The marriage customs differ widely
from those of tbe Japanese The ques
tion is first settled between the youth
and maiden, who then refer the matter
to their parents through a mediator,
who should be a relatie of the pro
spectie bridegroom The man must
send a present of lacquered ware,
which is regarded by them as one of
the most precious things in the world
This, howeer, is reclaimed by him if
his wife afterward seeks a diorce
Ainus lie In dwellings of about the
same class as those of the American
Indians The rude hut has two win
dows, one of them for ordinary earthly
uses, the other resered for the en
trance of the gods
Woman is fairly treated and held in
deep respect The man is not allowed
to enter the house when the woman is
in it alone, and he Is not permitted to
walk behind a woman When a man
meets a woman, he must salute first,
by smoothing his beard and rubbing
his hands Then she responds by
touching her nose with a finger of her
left hand
During October the Alnus hold a re
ligious fete, which is called the bear
festial, because they sacrifice a bear
which has been carefully fostered for
three years
Judicial punishment among the Ainus
consists of a seere beating with a
stick administered to the culprit The
crimes are generally theft— stealing ar
ticles or the wife of a neighbor As
there are eight men to one woman the
majority of the males are not married,
and jyifje stealing Is ery common The
accused is subjected to a long examina
tion by the chief of the community and
is then compelled to resort to the ordeal
of fire He must take a stone out of
boiling water If Innocent, the Ainus
think he will not be Injured If tbe
question cannot be settled In this way,
the principals in the dispute must fight
itout '  •
The Ainus are polytheists, though
they limit their gods to two, a god of
fire and a god of water The first is
called Kabekamoi and the latter llato
kamoi They, also, like most peoples
who hae a religious system, beliee In
some sort of heaen and hell— Japan
and America

Going; to Canoim
The saying "going to Canossa" refers
to the humiliating pilgrimage made
by the Emperor Henry IV to Italy in
the year 1077 Henry had objected to
the claims adanced by Gregory Hllde
brand and, refusing to submit, was ex
communicated by that pontiff The
emperor at first laughed at the sen
tence, but took a more serious iew
when he found himself "deserted een
by his personal attendants and resoled
in a Journey to Italy to make his peace
with the pope The latter was then at
the Castle of Canossa, a fortress of the
Countess Mathilda and situated in the
mountains of Modena Thither the em
peror hastened, but the pope refused
to see him sae under the most degrad
ing conditions
The desperate situation of Henry
compelled him to submit, and for three
flays and nights, barefooted and bare
headed, clad only in a hair shirt, the
raiment of a penitent, he waited at the
gate At* tbe end of this fearful pen
ance, which was undergone in the
month of January, he was admitted to
the piipal presence, was absoled and
receied his dominion as a gift from
the pope The expression has eer
since been current as indicatie of
abject submission on any terms im
posed by the conqueror
They Weren't Fed
"Some years ago'L-eald a San Fran
cisco man, "aetfobe trotting English
man came into the city by the Golden
Gate, and it fell to my lot to entertain
him So one night I took him to dine
at the far famed Cliff House It was
a beautiful moonlight night, and from
where we sat upon the porch we look
ed out upon the broad bosom of the
Pacific ocean The moon's light made
a path across the waters, and in its
center the Seal rocks lay like a black
patch The Englishman inquired what
they were and upon my informing him
saidPersonal 'Bah Joe, are those the Seal
rocks of which I hae heard? I'd ery
much like to see the seals I say, my
man,' turning to the waiter, 'caun't I
see the seals? Don't you feed them at
night?'
" 'Oh, yessir,' replied the waiter, who
was of Hibernian descent, without
blinking an eye 'At 9 o'clock we al
ways gies them their ham and eggs,
sir'
"The Englishman accepted this sur
prising piece of information without
turning a hair and announced that he
would surely be on hand at the time
mentioned He was; but, needless to
say, the waiter was not"
Knocked Her Oat With a Look
While talking of the many notable
people he met during his pugilistic ca
reer John L Sullian said one day In
New YorkPersonal "Once when I was In Syd
ney I had a suit of rooms directly oer
Sarah Bernbardt I neer met the
lady, and I didn't much care She was
jabbering French all the time and was
rehearsing constantly in her room 1
heard so much of it that I pretty near
had the willies Oue uight 1 happened
to follow Sarah Into her majesty's thea
ter In Sydney, and I had a good chance
to size her up She was a feather
weight all right, and there was so much
powder on her face that I thought she'd
made a mistake She got a look at me,
and because I had been so much annoy
ed with her jabbering I scowled at her
—gae her the look that used to scare
the dubs who tried to stay four rounds
with me Well, sir, Sarah gae one
long, mournful howl and fainted away
After that she didn't jabber any more,
for she'd found out who was liing up
stairs"
Not Clipped
A naturalist says that the squirrel
tribe is increasing all oer the wooded
districts of England and in the Scottish
lowlands In some parts of Scotland,
notably in the north, the little creature
is unknown
It is not so long ago that a Scotch
judge was trying a case which had to
do with the escape of a squirrel from
its cage and the question as to whether
It bad been stolen
"Were its wings clipped?" he asked a
witness
"But, my lord," Interposed the coun
sel, ''it is a quadruped."
"Quadruped or no quadruped," said
his honor sternly, "if its wings had
been clipped It could neer hae es
caped"
Vat of a liOns Breath
When chilled by exposure to cold,
take a long breath, with the mouth
firmly shut Repeat this seeral times
until you begin to feel the heat return-
ing It requires only a ery short time
to do this The long breath quickens
the pulse, and this causes the blood to
circulate faster The blood flows into
all parts of the eins and arteries and
gies out a great deal of heat. It is
stated that a long, deep breath, held as
long as possible, will close the pores of
a heated skin, and the danger of taking
cold, on stepping outdoors, may be thus
guarded against
Drops of Ink.
"A drop of Ink may make a million
think," quoted McSwilllgen
"So I hae heard," added Squlldig
"It may prooke language too A few
drops of Ink that I inadertently drop
ped on my wife's new carpet brought
forth about a million words, and all
energetic words too"
Boiled Clotheslines
When I buy a new clothesline, I boil
it for half an hour before putting It up
This toughens it, makes it last much
longer, and it does not snarl when put

Steenson's Cop of Misery
R I* Steenson, writing in 1593 to
George Meredith, in an epistle quoted
In a new edition of his "Letters" says,
with heart touching pathosPersonal
"For 14 years I hae not had a day's
real health I hae wakened sick and
gone to bed weary, and I hae done my
work unflinchingly I hae written in
bed and written out of It, written in
hemorrhages, written in sickness, writ-
ten torn by coughing, written when my
head swam for weakness, and for so
long, It seems to me, I hae won my
wager and recoered my gloe I am
better now— hae been, rightly speak
ing, since first I came to the Pacific—
and still few are the days when I am
not in some physical distress And the
battle goes on— ill or well is a trifle so
that it goes I was made for a contest
aud the powers hae so willed that my
battlefield should be this dingy, inglori
ous one of the bed and the physic bot
tle At least I hae not failed, but I
would hae preferred a place of trum
petings and the open air oer my
head"
The Life Ltne In One'a Band
There are three prominent lines In
the palm— the line of life, that of the
bead and the heart line
The line of life begins on the inner
boundary of the palm, about midway
between the thumb and the forefinger
If we imagine the left hand to be a
map, with the fingers pointing north,
this line runs toward the southeast
then cures toward the south and in
some hands cures finally toward the
southwest. It thus skirts the base or
"uprise" of the thumb, known as the
uprise of Venus If It is deep, broad,
of good color and extends nearly or
quite to the wrist and if the rest of the
haud indicates itality and cheerful
ness, the subject may be expected to lie
to a green old age; he has a good dispo
sition and the qualities which good
health and good temper usually create
Crane Island
In Lake Minnetonka Minnesota, there
is a picturesque island which takes its
name from the fact that it is unin
habited by man and gien oer to the
cranes Generations back these birds
decided upon this spot for a summer
resort As times went on and the sur
rounding islands populated no man
had the heart to disturb them, until
now Crane island is pointed out from
passing boats as one of tbe curiosities
of the northwest
Shae* and Colds
It is not generally known among men
that close shaing is apt to bring on a
cold Barbers, howeer, are acquaint
ed with this fact, and it is rather on
account of it than through any desire
to bring their patrons back soon again
that they do not, unless ordered to, ad-,
minister close shaes
A WORTHY SUCCESSOR
"Something Hew Under The Snn"
All Doctors hae tried to cure
Catarrh by the use of powders, acid
gases, inhalers and drugs in paste form
Their powders dry up the mucuous
membranes causing them to crack open
and bleed The powerful acids used in
the inhalers hae entirely eaten away
the same membranes that their makers
hae aimed to cure, while pastes and
ointments cannot reach tne disease
An old and experienced practitioner
who has for many years made a close
study and specialty of the treatment of
Catarrh, has at last perfected a treat
ment which, when faithfully used, not
only reliees at once, but permanently
cures Catarrh, by remoing the cause,
stopping the discharges, and curing all
inflammation It is the only remedy
known to science that actually reaches
the afflicted parts "This wonderful
remedy is known as "Snuffles the
Guaranteed Catarrh Cure," and is sold
at the extremely low price of one dol
lar, each package containing internal
and external medicine sufficient for a
full month's treatment and eerything
necessary to its perfect use
"Snuffles" is the only perfect
Catarrh cure eer made and is now
recognized as the only safe and positie
cure for that annoying and disgusting
disease. It cures all inflammation
quickly and permanently and is also
wonderfully quick to reliee hay feer
or cold in the head
Catarrh, when neglected, often leads
to consumption — "Snuffles" will sae
you if you use it at onco It is an ordi
nary remedy, but a- complete treat
ment which is positiely guaranteed to
cure Catarrh in any form or stage if
used according to the directions which
accompany each package Don'tdolay
but send at once, and write full particu
lars as to your condition, and you will
receie special adice from the dis
coerer of this wonderful remedy re

NO IDLE LAND THERE
Chinese Landlords Must Cultiate or

As among the oldest liing nations
China has the right to claim paternity
for a few important modern ideas at
least, and, strangely enough, an ap
proach to of the theories of Henry
George on the land question is among
them There no land is permitted to
be idle or unproductie If a landlord
allows his ground to go out of cultia
tion or attempts to hold it for a rise in
price, he is told to do otherwise
Should he fail to comply it is taken
from him and managed and owned by
the stato Moreoer, the soil is
equitably diided among the people
Each family is said to hae its patrimo
nial field that has been its inheritance
for ages The largest farms, as a rule,
are not more than thirty acres, and
throughout the whole empire there are
few landholders who own more than
fifty acres Most of the farms, or lots,
are from three to nine aeos in extent
These family farms can neer be sold
out of the line of succession so long as
one of the blood wants to buy them
All land Is taxed at a rate arying ac
cording to its fertility from about 15 to
40 cents per acre, and the rate has not
boon changed in many centuries —

THAT EMERGENCY BRIDGE
It is a matter for regret that the su
perisors hae s-een fit to let the con
tract for the bridge at Carbondale
without first calling for bids, and
especially so under the flimsy excuse
of being a case of great emergency
The truth is, the plain, proision of
the law requiring work of that char
acter to be subjected to open com
petition, after public adertisement
for proposals, has been brushed
aside without scruples, and a pre
ferred contractor selected to do the
work, without any effort, so far as
we know, to ascertain whether the
price charged, or the plans and
specifications submitted, were fair
and reasonable Is this method of
bridge building to be taken as a
precedent? Wheneer a bridge
needs reconstruction, all that the
superisors hae to do hereafter is
to pass a resolution that the re
building of the worn out structure is
a case of great emergency, and that
the necessities of traffic do not ad
mit of the matter taking the usual
course of calling for bids, and there
upon they are inested with all
legal authority to proceed according
to their own preferences, and let the
contract to whomsoeer they may
select, and at the contractor's
own price The superisors are
absolutely the masters of the situa
tion, according to this noel and
strained construction of the law
The point is so important that we
trust some citizen will file a protest
with the clerk or treasurer against
the payment of the contract price
of the bridge, the contract for which
has been let, in our judgment, in
open defiance of the law If our
laws, framed for the purpose of
guarding against faoritism in the
letting of public contracts, and to
protect the taxpayers from ex
traagance, can be eaded by a
simple resolution passed by the
board, it is time the people under
stood it, and the courts were called
upon to clearly define the law on
this proposition We do not beliee
the statutes are such a rope of sand
on a proposition so italjy -affecting
the public welfare, as the ! action Personalof
the superisors indicates
THE NEW CODES INVALID
California is haing a hard time in
its endeaor to recodify its laws
Up to 1873 we had no codes The
laws of the state were embraced in
the statutes passed at the arious
sessions of the legislature In 1873,
Creed Haymond, John C Burch and
C Lindley were appointed code
commissioners, and without much
ado or expense wrote our present
codes, which we're adopted by the
legislature -In 1895 Goernor Budd
appointed Messrs Wallace, Baldwin
and another to reise the codes
This commission sered two years,
drew $24,000 for their serices, $16,
000 for expenses, and accomplished
nothing Two years later, Messrs
Bulla, Caminetti and Shanahan were
appointed They sered two years
at a like expense, but failed to get
the legislature to adopt their work
In 1899 Goernor Gage appointed
Messrs Van Fleet, Freeman and
Dennis They wrote a' set of code
amendments, which were adopted
by the legislature, but which hae
been declared inalid by the supreme
court The point upon which the
court has knocked out the new codes
is that the legislature in passing the
amendments failed to comply with
section 24 of the constitution, which
proides that "no law shall be re
ised or amended by reference to its
title, but in such case the act re
ised or section amended shall be
reenacted and published at length
as reised or amended" The law
makers bumped up against this
plain constitutional requirement,
and hence the result It is a mis
take to say that the entire work of
the commissioners has been rendered
abortie by this decision If the
commissioners hae done their work
wisely and well in reising and re
arranging the codes, their work can
beutilized by the next legislature in
passing an act in conformity with
the constitution and the supreme
court's interpretation It delays the
adoption of the amendments, but
does not wipe out the labors of the
commissioners
The decision is far reaching One
of the changes attempted -to be
made related to the Personal publication of
notice to creditors in probate cases
Claims had to be presented to the
clerk of the court instead of the ad
ministrator It is now probable
that new publications will hae to
be made in all estates where the new
codes were followed The laws re
lating to  the disqualification of
judges, making it a felony for a
notary to indorse an acknowledg
ment or oath on a document in the
absence of the party executing the
same, and authorizing police judges
to solemnize marriages, all fall to
the ground

Mmder and Retribution
The Garduerille Record of Douglas
county, Neada, gies the following ac
count of the latest escapade of the
famous Indian outlawPersonal
Joe Pete, who was sentenced to be
banged for the murder of young Will
Dangberg, has added another ictim to
his list of crimes, this timo, his own
father-in- law, who has harbored him
for the past year
Pote entered the camp of old Monitor
George, near Woodford's, last Sunday
night, and asked for his mahala The
old man promptly ordered him away
Pete raised his Winchester rifle and
shot the old man, causing almost in
stant death The old mahala, in at
tempting to interfere, was battered
oer the head" with tho stock of* tho
rifle, and left for dead •'V
Consternation struck the Indians in
and about Woodford's, who hurried to
the stores for firearms and ammunition
It is thought that the fugitie will now
be captured or killed, as tho Indians
aro afraid to harbor the murderous
outlaw any longer
As a result of his last  murder, the
Indians held a consultation, and Pete's
own brother was choson to mete out
punishment to tin- man Tuesday he
found his man in hfc hiding place i
Alpine county, and shot him to death

Another Snake Story
In its latest issue the Calaoras
Chronicle tells about a "snake in a
cart wheel" Tho writer of that
journal saysPersonal
Mrs A F Gourley of Pino Groo,
while on her way to Valley Springs in
a cart, heard the rattle of a snake
The horse was walking slowly, and
while she could toll from the sound
that the snake was close, sho was un
able to locate it until she glanced at
one of the cart wheels, and there she
saw wriggling among the spokes, near
tho hub, a huge rattler fully four feet
in length Sho struck tho horse,
and tho rapid reolution of the wheel
threw tho reptile off The wheel had
probably passed oer it and it coiled
around the spokes and was no doubt
carried around many times before it
was noticed by Mrs Gourloy

A BIG MINING CASE
Suit Inoling the Rich Ledge of the
Central Eureka
Central Eureka Mining Company s East
Central Eureka
The important mining suit of Central
Eureka Mining Company s  East
Central Eureka was commenced in the
superior court last Monday morning
The importance of the suit, judged
from the interests inoled, which
amount to no less than the ownership
of the remarkably rich ore body en
countered in the Central Eureka mine,
on the summit of Sutter hill, has
naturally drawn a number of promi
netit outside attorneys into the case
On the side of the plaintiff corpora
tion, there appeared Warren Olney,
C H Lindley and W J McGee; and
for the defendants, A E Bolton, of
the firm of Galpin and Bolton, and
Judge C W Slack, both or San Fran
cisco Two shorthand reporters, one
for each side, are taking the testimony
Besides the attorneys, the principal
officers of the company are attending
the trial, among them being E B De
Golia, president; W A Van Bokkelen,
secretary; J H Grady, director, J Van
Horn and Chas Wagner, stockholders
For the defense there were present,
Jas Toman and C W Randall
The object of the suit is to quiet title
to that portion of the Central Eureka
ledge which runs under the surface
boundaries of the agricultural claim of
James Toman The Central Eureka
commenced operations, as far as the
present company is concerned, about
six years ago An old shaft had been
sunk to the depth of 700 feel, en
countering little or no pay ore The
present company continued this^pkaf I
down, and at the depth ot^-tOoO feet
pay ore came in, and-^ofif that point
to the bottop-<^the shaft, which is
2000f»» <rtf eep, the pay shoot continues
trrllts hae been run north and south
at arious depths following the ein,
but these had all been filled up with
waste to the 1060 leel; below that
point they were open The company
bonded the Toman ranch, which lies to
the east of the mining claim, and run
crosscuts at arious points to prospect
for new ore bodies AH these, how
eer, proed fruitless; the rock en
countered was hard greenstone, and
the company allowed the bond to be
forfeited, the ground being considered
of no alue for mining purposes From
the 1060 to the 1850 leel in the 6haf t,
the gouge was found on the hanging
wall, instead of the foot wall But
from tho top clear to the bottom of the
shaft, the testimony of W R Thomas
and the sureyor, W E Downs,
showed the fissure was clearly defined —
with smooth hanging wall and gouge,
indicating one continuous ein
Tho contention of the defendant is
that the ore body, not only extends in
its eastern pitch into the Toman
ground, but also that its outcrop is
within tho agricultural- land Of
course, if this is correct, the ore body
is part and parcel of the Toman ranch
If on the other hand,'' the ledjre out
crops within the boundaries of the
Contra! Eureka mining patent, and
the ledge is found to be continuous,
the mining prftent would hold it, no
matter how far it extends in its eastern
pitch beyond the surface boundaries of
the mining claim, and into the agri
cultural ground claimed by Toman
The suit is therefore instituted to en
join the defendant from setting up any
claim to any portion of the Central
Eureka ledge This ore shoot is the
richest for its size to be found in the
county The company is paying
regular monthly diidends, and the
outlook for the property is ery
promising
Nearly all the experienced mining
men of Amador county were called as
witnesses for the plaintiff, and testified
from actual examination of the condi
tions found in the Central Eureka
shaft, and the arious drifts and
crosscuts Among the witnesses be
sides the superintendent, W R
Thomas, were John Truscott, J F
Parks, John B Tregloan, and W F
Detert All were yery decided in ex
pressing their opinion of the unity of
tho Ceutral Eureka ein, and Its
identity with the regular mother lode
The remarkable smoothness of the
hanging wall and the regularity of its
pitch eastward was also a noticeable
featuroof the mine The regularity
of pitch enabled them to secure a good
working shaft by following the ein
from tpp to bottom One noticeable
feature brought out upon cross-exami
nation was that between the 1060 leel
and the 1240 leel the hanging wall of
the shaft was formed by quartz which
had not been blasted out in process of
sinking At the 1060 station this
quartz was 18 inches thick at the roof
and tapering to nothing a few feet
aboe The weight of the cross-exami
nation seemed to be to establish the
probability, from these left patches of
quartz on the east or banging wall of
the shaft, commencing as they did at
the point where pay rock was first met,
that this ein of ore entered the shaft
at this promt from the east, and that
two ore bodies i#et at this point, the
one from the east constituting the rjcb
ledge of tho Central Eureka All the
plaintiff's witnesses stoutly disputed
this theory, and contended that the
oneness of the ein was as fully dem
onstrated by theconditionsjin the shaft
and drifts as though those adhering
masses of quartz were blasted from the
shaft, reealing the smooth hanging
wall from top to bottom
Tho plaintiff's case was closed Thurs
day afternoon Tho defense moed for
a nonsuit, which was denied - ujj
The defendant offered in eidence a
deed from the Central Eureka Com
pany to James Toman and wife, which
purported to coney a certain triangu
lar piece pf land lying east of the Cen
tral Eureka" niiriing grpupd, It was
apparently intended to coney the sur
face right to a strip of land along the
eastern boundary of the mine The
contention of the defense seems to be
t;>at inasmuch as the deed makes no
reseration, It parries not only the sur
face, but also eerything beneath the
surface! which' would Include the eu
tire pay ore shoot Counsel for plain
tilt strenuously objected to the intro
duction of this deed, claiming that by
its terms it coneyed no portion of the
mining ground, surface or otherwise
The case is still on trial

Mining Notes
Dooley— A pocket containing $800
was taken from this mine last week by
the owners, the Dooley boys The
mine is on the old Kinne place on the
lone road Personal";
Central Eureka— This property
has paid monthly diidends regularly
for the past eight months, including
October There are 400,000 shares in
the company Six diidends were paid
at the rate of 2J cents per share, ag
gregating $60,000, and two diidends at
the rate of 2 cents per share, aggregat
ing $16,000, making a total of $76,000
The shaft is down to, a depth of 2000
feet, and the mine opened to tho 1860
leel, from which ore is now being sup
plied to the mill The company gies
employment to 80 men The mine is
in excellent shape under the able euper
intendency of W R Thomas, who has
had charge of the mine since the
present company started operations
Mitchell — At this mine, situated
one mile north of Pine Groe, the ten
stamp mill is kept running steadily on
good ore The mine is looking better
than it eer did A new ore body has
been opened on the 200 foot leel, from
which tho mill is being supplied The
ore is reported to be of better grade
than eer The success of the Mit
chell ought to encourage the deelop
ment of other mines in that icinity
There are many ledges around Pine
Groe which are desering of con
sideration Seeral of them hae been
bonded for one year, among them be
ing the Tellurium and Reward The
parties haing the bond hae held out
hopes of starting deelopment work
seeral times, but lie or six months
hae elapsed, and nothing whateer
has been done
Wildman — Work was resumed at
this mine early this week Spokane
capitalists, who are also largely inter
ested in mining operations in Idaho,
hae taken hold of the property It
is the intention to explore tho mine to
a greater depth, and if possible keep
the mill running at the same time
Bunker Hill— The shaft has reached
a depth of 1300 feet The drifts at the
800 foot leel hae encountered small
patches of ore
Goer— The drift from the 600 foot
leel of the Fremont has been run into
the Goer ground, and deeloped an
ore body 110 feet wide It is a low
grade proposition, as might be expected
from a ledgo of that size Still it is
claimed to bo milling rock, some esti
mating it at between $4 and $5 per ton
It is reported that a 60-stamp mill will
be erected in tho spring This disco
ery drill no doubt impart a new stimu
lus to the mining industry in the nor

A Bad Accident
Last Friday afternoon while the
stage— an extra— drien by Clee Jones,
an employe of Muldoon's liery stable
at lone, was rounding the cure near
the foot of the grade just beyond the
Copper mine, on the lone road, a bolt
that fastened one side of the pole to
the axle, broke, and let that side of the
pole drop to the ground, causing the
stage to swing around and turn com
pletely oer on its side There were
fie passengers aboard, and among
them was -our townsman, William
Tarn, who was quite painfully injured
In some way Mr Tarn's left foot and
lower part of his leg was caught, and
one of the small bones of tho ankle
was broken It is yery painful, but
not at all serious, and under the skill
ful treatment of Dr Lonigo he is doing
as well as could be expected Fredrick
Puteke, a German, was another of the
passengers that was seriously hurt in
the knee 'He was brought to the
Central hotel by the stage people, and
later he was sent to San Francisco for
hospital treatment We understand
that Puteke was settled with by the
stage owner ' Personal
Habeas Corpus Case
A writ of habeas corpus was issued
out of the superior court early this
week, commanding Mrs May V Good
man, to hae the body of Naomi Maud
Goodman, a child of four years, who
the writ alleged was being illegally re
strained of her liberty, before the su
perior court on October 14 It seems
that the mother of the child, the
diorced wife of Dr Goodman, of Sut
ter Creek, appeared in our sister town
late last week, for the purpose of gi
ing the father an opportunity of seeing
his child prior to the departure of the
mother and child on a isit to Indiana
The doctor considered that tho trip to
Indiana ut this season of the year
would be injurious to the child's health,
and hence employed D L Donnelly' to
commence habeas corpus proceedings
to enjoin the mother from taking the
child there The writ was heard last
Monday, and the court dismissed the
same, thereby permitting the child to
accompany its mother on her longtrip,
but at the same time requiring that
the absence of the child from the state
should not occupy oer three months

The New Train Serice
There is a rumor current to the
effect that there is some opposition to
the new schedule and extra train re
cently inaugurated on the Amador
Branch railroad between lone and
Gait The old combination train that
formerly carried passengers and freight
has been changed to afternoon, lea
ing lone about 3Personal30, and returning to
lone same eening Passengers ac
commodation is proided either way
on this train, but of course it is the
slow serice The morning train, how
eer, is for passengers exclusiely, and
leaes lone 40 minutes later, and re
turns to that town 30 minutes earlier
than formerly I It goes through with
out the long stoppages 'that usually
occurred under the old time table
The new arrangement has proed a
great conenience to the traeling
public It may entail additional labor,
and also some extra expense upon the
corporation, but it is unquestionably a
decided  boon ito passengers, j It is
hoped that the present arrangement
will be continued indefinitely, as the
benefits to the many far outweigh the
slight inconenience to the few The
efforts of the railroad company to meet'
the wishes of their patrons, as
exemplified in this double serice, are
thoroughly appreciated

BIG PRICES FOR ANIMALS

Next to the giraffe in the aristocracy

hippopotamus, worth from $4,000 to

these animals, he could get rich, but
the big mammals rarely breed in cap
tiity About the only place in America
where hippopotami hae been known
to raise their young is in the menag

the maximum price t because of the
beauty of his countenance, the ele
gance of his figure, his Intellectual en
dowments or his size, but because of

be  killed, usually after he has slain

Speaking of nightstlcks-*» u juds me
of seeing General Grant in nis^io,^
mind greatest hour, the only time lie~
was eer beaten, and by a policeman
I told his son, Fred Grant, of it when
he became a police commissioner in the
nineties, but I do not think he appre
ciated It He was not cast In his great
father's mold The occasion 1 refer to
was after the general's second term in
the presidency He was staying at the
Fifth Aenue hotel, when one morning
the Masonic temple was burned The
fire line was drawn half way down the
block toward Fifth aenue, but the po
lice were much hampered by the crowd
nnd were out of patience when I, stand
ing by, saw a man in a great ulster
with head buried deep In the collar, a
cigar sticking straight out, coming
down the street from the hotel 1
recognized him at sight as General
Grant The policeman who blocked
his way did not He grabbed him by
the collar, swung him about and, hit
ting him a resounding whack across
the back with his club, yelled outPersonal
"What's the matter with you? Don't
you sec the fire lines? Chase yourself
out of here and be quick about it"
The general neer said a word He
did not stop to argue the matter He
had run up against a sentinel and when
stopped went the other way That was
all The man had a right to be there;
he had none I was neer so much an
admirer of Grant as since that day It
was true greatness A smaller man
would hae made a row, stood upon his
dignity and demanded the punishment
of the policeman As for him, there
was probably neer so badly frighten
ed a policeman when I told him whom
he had clubbed I will waraut he did
not sleep for a week, fearing all kinds
of things No need of It Grant prob
ably neer gae him a thought— Jacob

Ilartman, who died in St Louis many
years ago, leaing nearly a million dol
lars to be fought oer by his heirs lie
made his first good sized pile on pat
ent medicines, then he picked up a
preat deal more on real estate, and at
last he rounded out with in
Montana copper, but he was known as
'Doc' Hartman to the time of his dL-ath
by his few intimate friends
"But the story that I'm going to tell,
and the one which he often told him
self, concerns his ery earliest experi
ences in the accumulation of money
Tim Hartman started life with $1 He
kicked around as a barefooted boy—
and a pretty mean one too — in a little
iowu •In Connecticut until he was IS
rears old, and at that time he had be
come so fresh and so full of wind and
general cussedness that his father one
Jay told him he was no good, neer
had been and neer would amount to
a picayune The old gentleman, just
to carry out the bluff, told Tim that he
had a good mind to cut him off with a
dollar and make him earn his own li
ing Tim straightened up and called
the bluff lie told the old man that he
would take the dollar and get out then
and there and hustle for himself Tho
old man handed him a crisp $1 bill and
told him that he'd be glad to see him
make a fortune with it
"The first thing that cuss did was to
go about in a'few back yards that he
knew of and gather together a lot of
empty bottles which were of no use to
anybody Then, for 10 cents, he bought
a large cake of a kind of white soap
that was then, and still is, on the mar
***-^He melted this soap and, after
borrow^^jn,, ancient pair of candle
molds t roin^ old gra in the ne , h 
borhood made t^, beautUul looki
candles of soap He neA lled bis bo £
ties full of choice rainwater "Itj*,^
made for himself one of those little"
three legged tables like the chuck-a
luck and shell "game en use outside
the circus, and struck out on foot for a
county fair that was being held about
• 40 miles away
"When he got there, he put up his lit
tle table outside the grounds, where
the crowd was pretty thick, lighted one
of his soap candles and began to extol
the irtues of 'Dr Hartman's Famous
Grease Eradicator,' contained in the
bottles set before him
" 'Now, ladies and gentlemen,' he
would shout In a stentorian but plausi
ble yoice, 'this marelous liquid, so
harmless that it can be drunk with im
punity by the smallest Infant and yet
so penetrating that it will seek out and
destroy stains and discolorations from
the most refractory substance, was dis
coered by accident by the famous sci
entist, Dr Ilartman, the eminent schol
ar, while he was wanderius o'er the
wilds of Patagonia It Is colorless, you
see, as the waters from heaen, and
yet obsere the effects of its startling
properties!'
"At this point Tim would reach for
his soap candle and, inerting it, would
smear a lot of the grease oer the
sleee of his coat 
'"Now, eery one of you knows, la
dles and gentlemen,' he would continue,
reaching oer and uncorking a bottle
of his rainwater, 'that there is nothing
so penetrating and lneffaceable as the
grease from a candle, and yet it is a
stain that we are all likely to suffer al
most eery eening of our lies while
toying with that common article of the
household, the candle You will ob
sere that my sleee is smeared with,
the annoying substance Behold'—
"Here that country bred fakir would
spill a couple of drops of his rainwater
on • the soap and with a rub or two
would produce a beautiful lather An
other swipe and the soap would hae
entirely disappeared from the^sleee,
leaing not a trace
 " 'Now, we make this famous eradi
cator In such enormous quantities,' Tim
would continue, 'that In order to Intro
duce it Into eery home hi this broad
land we will dispense with It at the
absurdly low price of 5 cents, a nickel
a bottle Step right up! Step right
up!'
"Then, when the public was surging
forward to purchase the rainwater,
Tim would pause occasionally to drink
a bottle of it, just to show that it was
absolutely harmless
"Well, the stuff went like hot cakes
When Tim's bottles were all exhausted,
he bought more, and when the fair was
oer he went to another and another
until he had traeled all oer the coun
try Then, in some way or other, I
don't know how, he got bold of some
old patent medicine, and, being a gen
ius, of course he made a big go of it

became a millionaire" — New I'ork

of myriad hu;--the lagoon of a light

ers the ast ocean of intense blue On
shore are great bunches of coeoanut
palms lifting their plumes in stately
magnificence, then there are lanes of
trees blossoming in red and yellow flow

low thatched houses of the naties
The delightful and healthy climate of
the island brings to maturity all the
products of the tropics, which arc-no
where found in greater fullness - and
perfection than here The wayfarer la
soothed by the fragrance of sweet
smelling flowers and delighted with the
abundance of oranges, bananas, bread

"paradise of the Pacific" or een the

turn the constant surprises keep the
traeler In a delirium of delight Some
times the sea lies before him, the
waes wreathed in  a foam of white

roar; on the other side the high, steep
mountains in forms of towers, domes
and steeples pierce the clouds Now
and then a silery band of water falls
from perpendicular heights to the tur
bulent stream below Then you pass
under the sheltering shadows of tall
interlacing trees which excel een the
grandeur of our elm Farther on you

A giraffe is ery timid on hearing
slight sounds, but is indifferent to loud
ones A writer in The Leisure Hour
saysPersonal "Noisy sounds, like a man walk
ing by with hobnail boots, it does not
notice, but a lady^oming in with hard
ly more sound than the rustling of her
dress makes It start, with pricked ears
and eyes distended We remember
well, after a terrible explosion of gun
powder on a barge on the canal, ask- 
Ing the keeper of the giraffes of that
day how they had taken it, and he said
he was surprised how ery little notice
they took They, jumped to their feet,
but almost at once lay down again
when they found nothing happened
"But," he added; "if I were at night
time to creep along that gallery In my
socks they would be so scared that I
beliee they would dash themseles to
bits" They fear the lurking foe, and
a bing bang scares them less than a
faint, rustling sound They are In that
respect ery deerlike"

Power Without Heat
As we watch the world famous plunge
of Niagara we are offered an impres
sie lesson as to the small alue in
heat of much motie power In so far
as the descent is perpendicular, so that
the water leaes the foot of the falls
with comparatiely little current, tho
effect of the concussion is simply to
warm the water through but one-sixth
of a degree F To heat the water as
much as one degree the falls would
hae to be 777 feet in height— George*
