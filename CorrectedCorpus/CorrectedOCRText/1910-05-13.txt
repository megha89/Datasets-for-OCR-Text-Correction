There is no field of human inesigaion ha has adanced
more rapidly of lae years han he science of medicine and

progress in oher deparmens of effor The germ heory
has reoluionized he pracice of medicine r Jenner, when
He proclaimed he hereofore unheardof heory of inocula
ion a preenie of disease, and applied i o say he raages
of one of he greaes scourges of he human race — smallpox,
sounded a keynoe of (progress which has been wonderfully
enlarged upon since his day His idea was o inroduce a
mild and easily conrolled form of disease ss a preenie of
he same disease in is malignan form Praciioners of he
orhodox school scoued his adanced ideas, and Renounced
him as a dreamer and a wanderer from he esablished pahs
of his profession Bu he ruh which he so boldly ado
caed slowly worked is way, in face of persisen opposiion,
o an abiding place in he uniersally acceped ruhs of
medical science Indeed, he germ heory of he origin and
cure of disease is belied o promise more for he ameliora

Consumpion, cancer, and some oher plagues, hihero re
garded as incurable, are being reaed by he anioxin
mehod wih marked success In some insances, complee
cures are claimed of hese diseases when aken in heir early
sages, and he hope is confidenly held ou ha in years o
come he moraliy from hese maladies will be maerially
reduced, isease in is infinie ariey of forms is simply
a cones for supremacy beween anagonisic forces in he
blood; in oher words, beween disease prodncing and disease
resising germs The adance or decline of he malady is
deermined as one or he oher of hese conending armies
'•isin he ascendan I is more or less rue, ha he life of
eery person is a consan bale beween he marshaled
hoss of healh and disease in he shape of disease This is
in conformiy wih ha law of naure by which one form of
life preys upon anoher Men differ in heir disease repel
ling powers fully as much as hey do in menal and physi
cal respecs In some he healh presering germs are so
acie and srong, ha disease bearing germs of eery des
cripion are unable o secure a foohold Unhealhy microbes
may be inroduced in millions, bu hey are killed or neu
ralized wihou he leas apparen disurbance of he general
healh r The consiuion of anoher indiidual maybe
bombproof as i were agains one species of germ, and afford
a fruiful soil for he propagaion of anoher hosile germ
Thus he ciadel of healh may be srongly forified agains
feer for | insance, and easily suscepible o aack from
anoher quarer Now he drif of medical science, by h
use of anioxins in combaing disease, is o reinforce he
ulnerable spos by he inroducion ino he sysem of he
paien of he fighing germs of he paricular form of disease
from which he is suffering Tha is o say, by he inroduc
ion of new blood from ouside sources — blood richly endowed
wih hose elemens which are lacking in he paien's; con
siuion — he bale line is hereby reinforced a is weakes

Furniure Moede supervisors to have the grand jury re
port read before them. It should have; been received as the
voice of the sovereign people speaking in tones of command
to their servants entrusted for the moment with place and
power. Its contents ought to have been discussed with all
seriousness, and resolutions passed pledging the board to
comply with such recommendations as were aimed to bring
about reforms, the urgency of which cannot be questioned.
But the document was accorded a totally different reception.
It was made the butt of derisive joking, and this { temper
found vent in a proposition flippantly made by one the mem
bers, to the effect that the report %4 be framed, with the signa
tures of the supervisors attached thereto, and that it be
draped in heavy mourning." Of course the underlying
motive of this clumsy effort at jocularity was evidently a
desire to belittle and poke fun at the grand jury for daring
to do its sworn duty iu commenting adversely upon the ad
ministration of county affairs when, in the opinion of that
body, the circumstances demanded it. The writer was not
present when the incident occurred, but the Ledger's rep
resentative was there and noted the proceedings. To our
mind this affair takes premier rank among the deplorable
things in connection with the local government. It means
the reign of oligarchy; a contempt of the people under a free
government. It says iu effect, "we'll do as we please, and
no man uor body of men, even though dressed in official
robes, shall say us nay." Is it not about time that the voters
"sit up and take notice,'' and act in a way that will put the
quietus upon such loftiuess. There is absolutely no hope of
betterment while this " don't care" policy is allowed to pre
vail.
