was pulling ou and he jumped aboard
The ccKducor on collecing his fare
punched a prined slip and handed i

"Wha's his?" asked Van Winkle
"Excess fare"
"Wha'll I do wih i?"
The conducor passed on wihou re

"Is here no sandard of honor?"
"No Once a merchan who failed

When Van Winkle reached New York
he wen o he banking house where he
had been employed I was now on

here, or, raher, no one knew him
So he wroe a noe o he presiden,

he had gone o see he world He
asked for a posiion, and here being a
acancy in a deparmen where large
sums were handled he was appoined
The salary was $800 a year
"Eigh hundred a year for guarding

"ll ha's changed, Waler We

"Insure I?"

"Poor dog Trus's dead indeed!" re

bu a lie firs sop we made in abou
an hour he said be would go back ino
he baggage car, rig himself up some
sor of a bunk and go o sleep I old
Frank Curis, my soker, ha I wish
ed Bob would offer o spell me a he
hrole for awhile, as I was mighy
sleepy Frank said he wished some
body would spell him, for he was boh
sleepy and ired
"We made a midnigh sop a 8, and
Jus as we were pulling ou who should
climb ino he cab bu Williams Wih
ou a word he ook he hrole ou of
my hand, and I undersood ha he
proposed o ake my place for awhile
The soker was siing on be cab sea
pulling he bell, and, ordering him off,
I ook his place, while he wen back
ino he ender and hrew himself on
be coal I kep on pulling he bell,
rying o keep awake, bu i was no
use I wen o sleep, hough I hough
I was awake, for I heard he bell and
was conscious of ringing i I suppose
I was boh asleep and awake, like sol
diers are someimes in bale when
hey'e been marching and fighing for
a long while wihou res There mus
hae been some wakefulness In me or
I couldn' hae kep my narrow sea,
for we were raling along a express
speed, and he road wasn' sraigh ei
her
"How Ions; I was in his condiion I
don' know, bu a big lurch woke me
up, and here on a semaphore ahead
was 'he red' Saring up, I looked
oer where Williams had been, and
wha do you suppose— he wasn' here,
nor any one else The engine was ear
ing along like mad a is own swiee
will hrough saions, oer crossings
and bridges, pas sideracked rains,
and here was 'he red' saring us in
he face I jumped for he hrole and
slowed down, hen whisled down he
brakes, for you mus know ha was
before he day of he air brake I
glanced around for Frank and saw
him laid ou on he coal heap sound
asleep I yelled a him and woke him
up
"Well, speak of a man's marrow
freezing wih horror My whole body
was frozen wih horror My eeh cha
ered, and I shiered all oer We
were approaching N, and I knew ha
since I had gien up my place o Bob
we had run eigheen miles How much
of ha ime we had been wihou an
engineer I didn' know, bu I found
ou ha if I hadn' been wakened up
by he lurch jus in ime o cach sigh
of 'he red' we would hae been el
escoped Ino a 'passenger sanding on
he rack a he nex saion ahead
"Bu Bob Williams — wha could
hae happened o him? Somehing, of
course, or he wouldn' hae lef his
pos I could hink of nohing unless
he had become unconscious, fallen o
he floor and rolled a a lurch ou of
he cab s soon as I go he rain o
a sop I old Frank o go back o find
ou if any one had seen or heard of
him Frank came back, wih blank
asonishmen wrien all oer his face,
and repored ha Williams was cud
dled up on a pile of runks in he bag
gage car sound asleep
"I was obliged o wall signaled
o go on and, leaing he cab, wen
back o he baggage car Sure enough,
here was Williams sleeping as peace
fully as a newborn babe
"The firs idea ha came ino my
head was ha I had dreamed he had
come back and spelled me, bu I knew
Ha a if I had fallen asleep wihou
some one o ake my place I would
hae done so a my pos Besides,
here was Frank He wouldn' hae
gone o sleep and dreamed he same
dream as I I was all balled up In a
puzzle I los no ime in waking Wil
liams
" 'Hae you been running my en
gine?' I asked
•"Your engine? No How could I?'
" 'Eiher you or your ghos came o
me and ook he hrole ou of my
hand'
"He sa up, looking a me in a sor
of dazed condiion for awhile, hen
suddenly urned pale
" 'Wha's he maer?' I asked
" 'I wonder If I'e been up o my old
ricks,' he said, caching his breah
"'Wha old ricks ?'
" 'Why, didn' you know I was a
sleepwalker?'
"I wen back o my engine and ook
he rain hrough, bu I couldn' ge
my sleep he nex day for he horrors
and hae hardly go oer hem when 1
