Meaning of he Moher Lode
 corresponden asked he edior
of he merican Mining Keiew lor
some informaion regarding he
moher lode, is significance of alue
and wheher or no he bes mines
are always on he Moher Lode Be
receied he following ineresing
replyPersonal
The erm Moher Lode originaed
in California wih he pioneer miners
of he early clays I was a name
gien o a succession of large ou
crops of whie quarz which were
found occurring a inerals under
arying geological condiions for
abou 120 miles hrough he counies
of Mariposa, Tuolumne, Calaeras,
mador and El oiado; many of
hese oucrops were found o be gold
bearing, bu some of he mos im
poran and riches mines of his
grea mineral bel were no characer
ized by huge oucrops
The Keysone mine a mador Ciy,
which has produced oer $16,000,000,
has only a small oucrop, and he
Eureka mine a guer Creek, wih a
record of 818,000,000, merely showed
a small oucrop of quarz— no more
han four or rie fee wide The
Empire and Pacific a Plymouh,
which produced abou 10,000,000, aud
were a one period he mos pro
duoie mines i he sae, are ob
scure a he surface
The Kennedy and rgonau a Jack
son, which hae urned ou nearly
§10,000,000 in gold, hae a compaia
iely small oucrop, eigh or en
fee wiae The Uica a ngela Camr
was no characerized by bold ou
croppings, nor was he Princeon in
Mariposa couny On he oher
band, here ore a score or more of
mines on he Moher Lode haing
huge oucrops, 100 o 300 fee wide
and sanding prominenly aboe he
surface, ha hae been exensiely
deeloped, which hae neer proed
profiable
The name, howeer, has iecome
famous and in almos eery miuing
region of bf world he miners usual
ly fix upon some lode or ein which
hey call he "moher lode" The
idea seems o be ha his main lode
is he paren ein of he regiou and
ha s in some manner responsible
for he oher eins o he iciniy
I merely represens he miners
fancy, and from any sandpoin he
"moher lode" is wihon paricular
significance, for as in California,
good mines are found in isolaed
posiion and in no mauner conneced
or idenified wih he principal
mineral lode or bel of he counry

reason we noice un aricle a all
is o refue be saemen, aud o
"expose" anoher of Webb's lies
The saemen ha The ispach pu
in a bill for "expiess 8109" is ab
soluely false and wihou foundaion,
and we hereby oballeuge Mr Webb o
produce any proof for bis asserion
On he oher band Tbe ispach can
produce mos subsanial eidence
ha Webb's saemen is unrue,
ha eidence is nohing more noi

and we defy Kicbard Webb or any of
bis jampered saellies o lnd any
iem on ba bill wbicb reads "ex

iem be hogwash commen referred
This is no he firs ime be Ledger
 has misrepresened acs in order o
find an excuse o hrow ' a few

When he Ledger underakes o ex

"be bill iself, which is on Hie" io
he reasurer's office We may possi
bly be misaken once in a while
Bu in faou of be "bluff" aricle
deying us o produce proof of onr
asserion, we his week looked up be
bill again, inending, if we found we
had madeienly fallen ino an
error, o mace he correcion, and
ake back be charge fer examin

wih our original saemen, as being
be only inelligible reading of be

July 28500 enelopes No 6^ 5250

Tbe word wbicb we consrue as
"express" is indisincly wrien; i
migh be inended for "expense" or
expenses The xis wrien as a "p"
bu ba would be meaningless We
asked anoher o Inerpre, and he
was unable o ell wha i sood for
nd we defy hose who allowed i o
make ou anyhing else han express
or expense nd in eiher case be
oucome is he same I is an exra
charge, wrien as such, in connecion
wib he furnishing of 500 enelopes,
and herefore falls wihin be scope
of a grafing business Tbe schedule
price is $250 for 500 enelopes Tha
is all we hae charged, all we hae
been allowed, and why he super
isors should peimi be ispach o
charge 0 per cen more and do i
monh afer monh, is beyond our
comprehension n esablished rae
is supposed o apply o all who furn
ish supplies o be couny officers
I behoes be superisors o see ba
no oercharge is made Tha is wha
bey were eleced for Bu his
seing aside of he schedule adoped
10 years ago, and refusal o adop
anoher, if i has become obsolee,
hereby allowing one shop o ring in
exra, while anoher adheres sricly
o he oldime wornou schedule, is
a shame and a disgrace Tbe Ledger
does no propose o inenionally
misrepresen anyhing I has gien
he facs as far as we could gaher
hem from he bill The ispach
failed o inform is readers wha his
exra 81 for 500 enelopes was for,
and we now call upon our ooempor
ary o enlighen be public on ba
score Le us know wha he mean
by he word we hae inerpreed
as "express" and canno upon re
examinaion inerpre in any oher
way
In he bill of our coemporßry
allowed by he superisors a heir
meeing las week, he same gouging
acics are pursued The wording I
changed bu be resul reached is pre
cisely be same In his bill we find
wo iems reading as followsPersonal
500 6% enelopes 8250, sock 81 13 8U
Ihe word "sock" is subsiued
for "express' or "expenses," bu be
graf o 0 per cen on he shedule
price is reained in each iem I
would cerainly be a wonderful ac
complishmen for a priner o furnish
enelopes or any oher prined maer
wihou sock The order for prin
ing necessarily includes be sock
If a merchan orders 500 enelopes,
and was charged $250 for prining
and 81 for sock, be would be ap o

Cable Bieaks and George Troyan
Falls o His eah
 lamenable acciden, causing be
insan deah o George Troyan, one
of he shif bosses, occurred a he
rgonau mine on Sunday afernoon
I illusraes ha nowihsanding
he umos precauions, accidens are
liable o occur in a manner leas ex
peced George Troyan, ha foreman
of he day shif, was a oe lowes
leel in be mine, 2000 fee, a abou
wo o'clock in he afernoon There
is a donkey engine in be shaf a he
2100 loo leel, which is used in
hoising or lowering below ha leel
Tbe cable is wire, lieeighs of an
inch hick
I had baen in use ba seen
mouhs, and he life of a cable of
ha size is from wo o hree years
No one had eer complained abou
is beiug unsale, and ^he men rode
up and down oil i wihou he leas
apprehension of danger i was ex
amined regularly, and eery pre
cauion was aken o keep n good
working shape i was he business
of Troyan as much as anybody's o
acquain himself wih be condiion
of he cable, as he had charge of be
cable and eeryhing in he mine If
any employe had ccnsidered be cable
unsafe i was his duy o repor o
eiher be superinenden or one of
be shif bosses Tbera were ober
ways of ascendiug and descending
beween he 2100 and lower leels
besides be skip There was be
ladders, and also be sopea The
'ao ha be skip was preferred by
be men shows conclusiely ha he
employes considered eeryhing abou
he cable in firsclass order, and per
fecly safe fer he acciden re
pors were curien on he sree ha
he cable had been condemned as un
safe; ha he company bad negleced
o change i afer being requesed so
o do ooording o he sworn eai
mony a be inques, here was no
be shadow of ruh in hese repoia
The acciden, so far as known,
happened i his way, Chas V
Kohler he engineer on duy a he
2100 leel a be ime, says he skip
bad been raeling up and down all
he afernoon He go be sigual
from he 2(300 o hois He knew
from he mehod of ringing who wus
signaling, ha i was George Troyan
Some one sopped a he 2500 leel,
and he hen go 32 bells o lower o
he 2(500 leel He sopped here four
minues, and hen go 31 bells,
which mean "hois— man on" Knew
i was Troyan ha was giing he
signal He pu on he air, and
immediaely fel a jerk, and a he
fame ime he bell rang again He
knew ha somehing had gone wrong,
and expressed his foars o  aalle,
who was sanding by him The cable
bad pared, and someone was aboard
a he ime They hasily descended
he ladder o he 2000 leel, and
found no one here Wen below ino
he sump, and foind Troyaii's cap
resing on he imbers wo ses below
he saion The only inference was
ha he icim wih be skip had
gone ino he sump, conaining fifeen
fee of waer Grappling iruns were
sen down as soon as possible, and a
he firs effor he body o be un
forunae icim was brough o he
surface, and aken o he op of be
shaf
n examinaion reealed no dis
liguring marks upon he body, excep
a superficial abrasion of he skin oer
be forehead, belieed o hae been
caused by he rope I was no
sulHicen o cnuse unconsciousness
The opinion is ha be was drowned
•in he waers of he sump The cable
pared abou 70 fee aboe he skip
I did no break wbile being hoised,
ba before i sared upward s
soon as he cable ighened be jerk
indicaed ha i had snapped e
ceased wih he skip fell 70 fee on
he incline I is supposed ha be
skip neer lef he rack
The body was remoed o he home

facs as aboe saed I was shown
ha four men had ridden on ha
skip a one ime on he morning of
he acoiden; ha U Boas had ridden
on i only en minues before he
acciden; ha no one apprehended
be leas danger; ha he cable was
500 fee in lengh, only one half o
which was used, ha by changing ho
cable which he deceased had spoken
of shorly before his deah he mean—
no puing on a new cable, bu
simply changing ends of he one hen
in use, as he end wound round he
reel had neer been used, and was as
good as new There wa3 no need of
Ihe men going on his skip, as he
main skip in he oher comparmen
was aailable, bu hey seemed o use
he smaller one as more conenien
eceased remarked o he engineer
on he morning of be acciden ha
he inended o change he cable shor
ly, bu ha i would answer for a
while ye He did no mean ha i
was worn o any dangerous exen
The jury reurned a erdic ha
deceased came o his deah by he
accidenal breaking of be cable, and
ha no blame could be acbed o
he company for be faaliy
I was one of hose unforunae
aairs ha no human foresigh could
guard agaios Eeryhing had been
done by he engineer o keep be
cable properly greased, which was
essenial o is preseraion The
we, damp condiions exising a ha
