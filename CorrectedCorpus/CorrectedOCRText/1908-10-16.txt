n Old English Law
We came aoroas a queer lile iem
In an exchange a few 'days ago I
wna an old Kigliah law passed during
he reign of Queen Ulizabeb Parlia
men solemnly enaned, "ha any
woman who from ha dae, would
deceie or cajole ino marimony any
of he subjecs of ber majesy by be
use of false hair or any oher hing
false i connecion wih he body, or
by be use of cosmeics, would be
punished as for fraud' aud decei,
wih inen o cause harm"
I was said his law was designed
for he proecion in England of he
persecued male box, and no man bad
eer had be courage o reoke be
law, and i now sands on he saue
books of England
I is ery well o ry and proec
poor, persecued men, bu he men
in our counry don' need such a law,
for hey marry wih heir eyes wide
open, and now almos eery woman
hey mee in fashionable sociey is
'made up"; nnd on ho woman's par
here is no effor o deceie and she
goes abou her adorning quie openly
Ihe "ras" and "mice" ha adorn
ber head are ery peroepible, ' be
pain on her faoe shows for iself
Une day you mee a woman wih dark
hair; he nex s {brigh red or
golden, jus as he fashion of be day
calls for, and so on wih be body
false bus, false hips, and anyhing
else false ha adds o be looks So
if such should be be law in our
counry, few women would marry,
i seems a piy women could no
realize how much more aracie
bey ,'aio as Uod made hem, and
should be conen o say so, for
such aids do no add a all o
heir good looks, for all wbo look
upon hem know bey are false I
has been ery ruly said—

speaker, excep he preliminary small

anyhing bu propiious from a
poliical oulook The rain was
descending in orrens when he ime
for opening he meeing drew near
The Miliary band played in fron
of Loe's ball o gaher he crowd
Somehow here was a noiceable
failure o respond by a gonoral ou
pour of ciizens, as was won o bo
he ense in years gone by The
aracie force of campaign oraory
has been on he wane for years The
enhusiasm of handclapping and
cheering, and brass bands and pro

ceased as he necessary nocompoui

When he hour for opening he
meeing came, he hall was a Jong
way from being filled, indeed he
empy spaces were as conspicious aa
he iled seas r Endico, as
chairman of he couny cenral com
miee, opened ho meeing by a brief
speech, in which he jokingly said
he democras were cerain o elec

as presiden
H C Bole waa eleced chairman of

who were called o he plaform o

Waier Mcrhur was inroduced
He is presiden of he Seaman's

hen wen on o explain he labor
moemen, claiming ha workingmen
could no ge a square deal from heir
employers unless hey were organized,
and worked as a uni Unions had
differen ways of enforcing heir de
mands for improemen of heir con

he srike and he boyco 'ibey
appealed o he publio hrough a free
press, ho ligh of assembly and free

sympahy of he publio for heir
righs If ba sympahy was on
heir side hey would win, if oher

drif of be argumen was ha publio

he was in faor of Bryan and demo

The opening of he campaign in mador couny from he
Bryanie side mus hae been decidedy dishearening o he
supporers of he peerless one from Nebraska In almos
eery respec he gahering was in painful conras o he
poliical meeings of years gone by I may be rue, ha
republican meeings nowadays suffer also by comparison wih
hose held during a presidenial canass of bygone days The
general enhusiasm ha found en in orchligh processions
blazing bonfires, and and oupouring of ciizens from far and
near, is largely lacking Bu he democraic whoopup his
week was remarkable for is shorcomings in oher ways,
as showing he seady decadence of a once powerful naional
pary The one speaker of he eening inroduced himself,
no as an expounder of disincie democraic docrines, bu
as a special pleader in he ineres of organized labor, He
candidly admied ha were i no for he sop hrown ou in
he democraic plaform by he inserion herein of he ani

in his proposiion is selfeiden I was remarked by some
of he hearers ha he speech would hae sounded less dis
cordan if deliered in he hall of a labor organizaion, in
sead of au appeal for suffrage of merican cizeus for class
legislaion of he mos dangerous samp The significan
feaure is he srais o which democracy is reduced i is
despairing effors o rap oes The pary seems o be work
ing on he heory ha in he labor organizaions here aie
enough oes o bring enough doubful saes o he demo
craic fold, proided hey can be had fairly solid, and hence
hey are bending heir energies i his direcion Gompers
in he eas and Me rhur and oher paid officers of he
union are ou sumping for Bryan, proclaiming docrines
which are subersie of he ery principles of good goern
men I is he same spiri ha joined hands wih populism
and oher delusie fads, under which he democracy has been
wased o is presen skeleon form "nyhing o win,'' is
he slogan, direced his year in a franic effor o muzzle he
cours in labor roubles This course ends o he disrup
ion of boh he labor organizaions and he democraic pary
Inelligen workingmen refuse o be dicaed o in poliics
by officials of heir labor unions On he oher hand he
conseraie elemen of democracy canno approe of he
drif of he pary from oldime moorings, oward ulra radi
calism The sacrifice of principle for expediency is rarely
a winning game s for he masses of independen oers
who rain wih no pary, hey are ap o ake no chances wih
he heresies of Br3'an They will prefer republican rule,
and a coninuance of prosperiy which ha pary's suprem
acy has neer failed o insure for he merican people

"Chuck It, Duke!"
While the Duke of Connaught was
in Cairo he went for a stroll one morn
ing, and on his way back to his quar
ters he came face to face with an old
Englishman wearing the ribbon of the
Indian mutiny on his breast. The
duke stopped and spoke to tbe man
about his military service for some
little time. Presently tbo man said,
not knowing, of course, to whom he
was speaking, "Are you in the army
yourself, then, sir?" Tho duke smiled
and admitted that he was. "Getting
on all right?" was tho next question.
The duke smiled again and said that
he had not very much to grumble at,
on the whole, though perhaps he was
not doing quite so well as he could
wish. "No, and you never will, my
boy," was the surprising retort of tho
veteran. "What you want In the army
today is either brains or a tremendous
amount of Influence behind you. You
may take my tip, old chap, and chuck
It:"— London T. P. O.
Fencing With Umbrellas.
Recently a French publication print
ed a picture of some American girls
fencing with umbrellas and stated that
they were trying to acquire thus the
necessary skill and assurance to parry,
with a simple gesture, an attack of
Apaches.
It also stated that this sport was not
born in America; that lor several years

The Lost Town of Indiana.
I''nr more than three-quarters of a
century Salisbury Ind., has bceii a
lout town.
Where once was a flourishing city
In embryo in Wayne county, not a
vestige of litunim habitation remains.
Usually, when a town retrogrades,
tbeie is at least a remnant of its pros
perity lot't. Not so, with Salisbury.
Not a building stands to show tbat
troni 1810 to 1820 it was a prosperous
community, which bad evolved from
framo to brick buildings, and which
had aspirations of becoming a inland
metropolis. Only a crock and a
country road remain of what wav
once Salisbury.
When Salisbury ceased to be the
county seat it went into a rapid de
cline. Conturvillu robbed Salisbury
of its birthright. And horn 1820,
when tbo brick courthouse became
useless, Salisbury rapidly succumbed
to the blow.
In six years there were hnrdly a
dozen families left. Then silently
one by one, they too, stole away.
Salisbury expired without a gasp,
and the rest of the thriving world
knew not tbat it had gone.
As the years went by Cencervilie
lost her honors also. Richmond
became the county seat. But that
didn't help Salisbury. Nothing re
mained of tbat ill-fated burg but a
low buildings. And gradually even
they succumbed to tbo general de
cline Ono by one they rotted or
were carted away. Not even a shed
remained to mark the poor town's
site. Salisbury was oil' tnu map.
All that is now left of Salisbury is
a legend. A pretty legend it is,
though; ono that goes for beyond tbe
modern bustle and thrift that brushed
Salisbury oil' tbo map.
At tbe beginning ot tbe nineteenth
century, so the tradition runs, a band
of pioneers came upon two Indian
lovers at their trystinc-place. L.ike
tbe told young brave that he was,
tbe redskin valiantly det'emlod lnm
self and bis sweetheart from capture,
and in tbo struggle both were killed
and went to tho happy bunting
grounds together. ,
After tbe struggle the pioneers bo
came charmed with the beauty of Ibe
spot. They decided to settle there
and Salisbury was born.
JSut it was a luckless birth, attend
ed, so tbe legend runs, by the curso
of the red maiden's old mother, who
declared tbat tbo town would not
live, hut would disappear from tbe
face ot tbe earth.
It was tbe first; settlement in Wayne
county. Aud among its noted sons
was Oliver P. .Moiton, the war gover
nor of Indiana. Jiut, though fortune
seomed to smile at first, it soon begnn
to frown, and now Salisbury is but a
memory.
