BLNCING RESULTS
THE LW OF CONSEQUENCES N
THE PROBLEMS OF LIFE
Good or Eil in Things la iscoered
by Obserations of CanHcquencen,
Morals re etermined by the Con
sequences of Human ctions
 reaction is the consequence of an
action; an effect Is the consequence of
a cause; a result is the consequence of
an antecedent  It Is eident that the
words reaction, effect, result and con
sequence express different manifesta
tions of one law, usually called the
law of causation, though it would be,
I beliee, more correctly named the
law of consequences
Ye shall understand more clearly the
interactions in human affairs when we
recognize that the meaning of the
words reaction, effect and result is in
cluded In the word consequence We
may doubt the importance of reaction
in our affairs, but we shall not doubt
the importance of consequences
We are compelled to gie considera
tion to consequences in the most tri>l
affairs One has consequences in iew
when lie strikes a match, sets a pot
to boil, plants a seed, pulls a weed,
sharpens a pencil, mends a fence Shall
I take an umbrella? I balance the
danger of rain against the annoyance
of the umbrella and decide accordingly
Shall I change my coat? Take another
cup of coffee? Walk or ride? Each
question will be decided in accordance
with my estimate of the balance of re
sults In considering possible adan
tages or disadantages, gains or losses,
we are balancing consequences, en
deaoring to anticipate and weigh the
results of our actions
Regret is usually a reminder of a
neglect or misjudgment of conse
quences, while repentance and reforma
tion indicate a waking up concerning
consequences Our interest, curiosity,
anxieties, fears, hopes and ambitions
are concentrated upon consequences
We seek adice when we are doubtful
about consequences Precepts and ex
amples elucidate consequences We
work and rest, eat and drink, scheme
and plan, spend and sae, for conse
quences ;,'Personal
The lesson of consequences which
the indiidual often learns slowly and
imperfectly the sound business organ
izations acquire, quickly and enforce
by discipline The salesmen in a suc
cessful store are characterized by tidi
ness, promptness and a desire to please;
the employees of the important rail
roads are not een permitted to an
swer Insult with Insult The industry
that is Intelligently managed will
aoid misrepresentation and decep
tion, knowing that a reputation for
truth and fairness Is ital to continu
ous success The shrewdest maxims
of trade are built upon the obseration
pf cpnsequences
That mind Is the strongest which hag
the clearest judgment of consequences
The fools are those who know little
about consequences The child must
be guarded because it is ignorant of
consequences Wha{ we know of nar
cotics, stimulants, antidotes, hygiene,
surgery, chemistry, agriculture, me
chanics, commerce, culture, we know
through the obseration of conse
quences The best razor, plow, sani
tary system, plan of social betterment,
Is that which produces the best results
Knowledge, learning and experience
deal wholly with cause and conse
quence The science of astronomy
seeks to comprehend the heaenly bod
ies and their Influences upon each oth
er The science of chemistry explains
the consequences of chemical action
The science of political economy aims
to distinguish and mark the good and
eil results of different systems of Jand
tenure, taxation, trade and finance
The science of goernment would de
termine what political system is best
for a people The science of war seeks
to know what arms,' equipments, forces
and maneuers will inflict the great
est Injury upon {he enemy with a m|n
imum of expenditure The science of
language deals with the utility of
words, pronunciation and forms of ex
pression nd so on through the whole
of human experience knowledge seeks
to distinguish that which has the best
results from that which has inferior
or eil results
Our ideas of right and wrong are due
to the nature of the responses to hu
man actions How do we know that
truth is better than falsehood? Be
cause we are better pleased with our
seles when we speak truthfully than
when we He; because truth Is essential
to understanding; because we despise
lying in others; because lying leaSs to
confusion, uncertainty, chaos, enmity
and to other eil consequences nd
so also we hae formed a judgment of
loyalty and treachery, cruelty and
kindness, irtue and ice, by their con Personal
sequences
Our laws, customs and command
ments would not proe to us that truth
1? better than lying if our own experi
ence did not confirm it The ecalogue
Is effectie only so far as nature cor
roborates it
Our common conceptions of morality
are the results pf the pbseration of
human actions and their consequences
—of cause and effect, of action nnd
reaction We know that certain ac
tions are right and others wrong, ns
we know that bread Is good nnd straw
bad for food; that light clothing is
more useful in summer than in win
ter; that cleanliness is better than
filthiness; that the way to walk is for
ward, not backward; that mirth is
pleasanter than grief
s the alue of a machine or imple
ment is shown in its working and the
alue of a tree by its fruit, so the mer
it or demerit of food, drink, medicine,
acts and thoughts Is determined by
their results, reactions or effects by
their consequences,— From "BalancePersonal

LPINE GUIES
The Trouble They Sometimes Bam
With Reckless Climbers
The lpine guide frequently risks his
health, strength, een his life, for per
sons who may hae been themseles
the cause of the peril  encountered
The qualities of a first class guide,
saya the author of "dentures'on th
Roof of the World," iuclude not only
skill in climbing, but the ability to
form sound conclusions in moments o\
danger  certain climber tells an an
ecdote which bears on the importance
of the guide's powers of Judgment
 member of the lpine club was
ascending a peak in company with an
Oberland guide Part of their courst
lay oer a snow field which sank grad
ually on one side, stiarply ended by a
precipice on tbe other The two were
walking along not far from the edg€
of this precipice when the English
man, thinking that an easier path
might be made by going still nearei
the edge, dierged a little from his
companion's track To his surprise,
the guide Immediately caught hold oi
him and pulled him back with more
igor than ceremony, well nigh throw
ing him down in the operation Wrath
ful and not disinclined to return tht
compliment, the Englishman remon
strated The guide's only answer was
to point to a small crack, apparently
like scores of other cracks in the nee,
which ran for some distance parallel tc
the edge of the precipice
The traeler was not satisfied, but h€
was too wise a man to argue while a
desired summit was still some distance
aboe him On the descent when th
scene of the morning's Incident waa
reached the guide pointed to the crack,
which had grown perceptibly wider
"This marks," he said, "the place
where the true snow field ends I feel
certain that the Ice from here to the
edge is nothing but an unsupported
cornice hanging oer the tremendous
precipice below It might possibly
hae borne your weight, though I don't
think It would" Thereupon he struck
the nee on the farther side of the ice
sharply with his ax  huge mass
immediately broke away and went
roaring down the cliff
The traeler was full of amazement
and admiration and thought how there,
on an easy mountain and in smiling
weather, he had been ery near to
making himself into an aalanche
SYMPTHY
Sympathy is food to a staring heart,
Sympathy is two hearts pulling at
one load
Sympathy is the staff on which trou
ble leans '  >
Sympathy Is the cream that rises on
the milk of human kindness
Sympathy in sorrow's hour is like the
gentle rain to drooping flowers
Sympathy is the least the rich, may
gie, the most the poor pan offer
Sympathy is the blossom grown from
tbe costly bulb called personal suffer?
Ing ~" f %
Sympathy Is a well toned instrument
that readily responds to notes of weal
or yfm
Sympathy is the most powerful hu^
man magnet far attracting and holding
friendship
Sympathy is perfect forgetfulness of
oneself in true feeling for the unhap
piness of others
Sympathy is loe's healing balm
spread by pity's tender hand on sor
row's heart wound
rtificial Beauty In Rome
Personal artifice is at least as old
as' the Roman empire, for, speaking of
the artificial beauty of a coquette, llar
tiol saysPersonal "Gollu, you are but a com
position of falsehood While you were
liing at Rome your bolr was growing
on the banks of the Rhine t night
when you lay aside your Silken robes
you lay aside your teeth also Two
thirds of your person are locked up in
boxes for the night The eyebrows
with which you muke such insinuating
motions are the work of your slaes
Thus no man can say, 'I loe you,' for
you are not what he loes, and no one
loes what you are"
 Lord Bold Into fSlneo 
Charles Rgade found the hero of his
noel, "The Wandering Heir," in the
person Qf Lord ltham of Ireland, who
was sold as a "redemptloner" at Phila
delphia In 1728 and who sered for
twele years in effect as a slae to one
or more masters in Lancaster county,
Pa The young nobleman was recog
nized by two Irishmen who came by
accident to the house where he lied,
and dmiral Vernon afterward took
him back to Ireland Reade laid the
scene of Lord ltham's seritude in

established that this was an error

CYENNE PEPPER
Try a Sandrlch of It if Yon io
Troubled With Insomnin
"id you eer try a cayenne peppet
sandwich?"
This question was asked a lady to
whom sleepless nights were growing
to be an almost unendurable burden
 "Not that, but I hae tried about
eerything elde," was the discouraged
answer "I d»n't suppose, howeer,
that it woulc> do me any more good
than the thousand and one things I
hae tried"
• "I hae suggested the remedy to a
great many people similarly afflicted,
and in eery instance good results hae
followed I wish you would let me
make you one"
The haggard face of the sleepless
; woman told its own story  She lan
guidly assented to her friend's request,
with little or no faith in its efficacy,
yet willing, like the proerbial drown
ing man, to "catch at a straw" that
promised any relief
• ' cracker was forthwith produced
and quite generously buttered  lib
eral sprinkling of cayenne pepper was
then added, the two hales put togeth
er and the patient requested to par
take of the spicy concoction
Strange as it may seem, but little
inconenience was experienced The
slight smarting sensation in the mouth
was soon oer, and no unpleasantness
wB felt in the stomach The crackei
was eaten Just before retiring, and
ery soon after the patient was sleep
ing peacefully
The pepper acted as a stimulant to
the stomach, drawing the blood from
the excited brain and inducing a night
of more refreshing sleep than had been
experienced for a long time The rem
edy was repeated the next night, with
the same result  cayenne pepper
sandwich is much less harmful than
drugs and when taken in small quan
tities is a good tonic for a weak stom
ach
Sick headache has also been known
to yield to a cup of hot water to which
hae been added a generous pinch of
cayenne pepper and a nip of soda as
big as a pea— Table Talk
TRICKS OF THIEVES
Cleer Schemes That id In the Per
petration of Crime
"Thiees resort to cleer methods in
order to get away with the goods," gaid
an old police officer, "and I am firmly
coninced that if the criminals of the
world would deote tbe 6ume amount
of time, talent and patience to think
ing out uplifting and adantageous
schemes for humankind they would
in a short while reolutionize the world
in many useful ways But somehow
the mind of the criminal seems to
be sharper, if I may say it, ami bright
er and quicker than the mind of the
honest man The fact maj r be ex
plained in any number of ways In
the first place, the criminal has noth
ing to do but think out some plan,
of getting something that doesn't be
long to him That is his special busi
ness Quite naturally the plan he
works out under those circumstances
will often startle een the oldest men
in the police departments of the coun
try Who would hae thought of the
wire saw, a thing so small that it can
be slipped In between the layers of the
shoe sole, but the criminal who found
in it a ready, conenient and unfailing
means of escape? He Is constantly
thinking up some new scheme Here
we find a man and woman In a Jewelry
store The woman carries a parrot with
her The bird suddenly gets away and
begins to flutter around in the store
The Jeweler is afraid the parrot will
break something He tries to catch it
and succeeds after a short while 
small purchase Is made The man and
the woman leae Result, seeral hun
dred dollars' worth of Jewelry gone
It was stolen during the excitement
oer the bird Good scheme, eh ? Yet
it is but one out of a million worked
by the cleer degenerates of the
world" — New Orleans Timesemo

The Spinning Wheel In Ireland
The spinning wheel and the flax
Wheel are still found in the Irish cot
tages, where many a girl has her wed
ding dowry of linen and homespun
made at home lthough It is more
the task of the older women, there are
still girls who do their spinning stint
and lay by a certain amount for their
wedding outfit  pleasant sight It is
to see the elderly women outside their
cottage doors spinning the flax or the
wool s long as the weather Is warm
the sturdy Irishwoman, old or young,
scorns a roof except to sleep under
The free air and sunshine are her
choice, and the sweet sky is the fairr

Politics and Humor
In the world of politics the man who
would obtain political preferment must
be serious No man who cultiates hu
\mor to the exclusion of his other gifts
can hope to attain to the highest places
In the political arena The merican
citizen reseres the inalienable right to
Vote for whom he wills, and the serious
man who suppresses his sense of hu
mor rather than the man who culti
ates it is honored with his preference

OUR TRESURE IN KETS
Bis Poetry of Three imensions
Height, Breadth and Solidity
In reading Keats one is struck with
the wealth of his equipment, the solid
qualities of his art, his soaring Imagi
nation, his rare sense of beauty, his
range of emotional response, his rich
resources of language, and, not the
least noteworthy, his capability of
growth In taste To consider what a
poet thus endowed might hae gien
to the world had he lied to the age of
Shakespeare or Milton excites the
mind almost to pain, so little short of
miracle was his actual achieement
We beliee there Is no eidence that
he wrote a line of erse after his twen
tyfifth year, and he probably wrote
little after his twentyfourth, and yet
what a glorious body of life and Inspi
ration he has left! It Is poetry of three
dimensions— height, breadth and solid
ityPersonal nd yet, withal, it has arrowllke
intensity— a quality of which he him
self said, "The excellence of eery art
is its intensity, capable of making all
disagreeables eaporate from their be
ing in close relationship with truth and
beauty", ;;Personal>,Personal;
His transcriptions of tbe classic into
modern speech in "Hyperion" and "La
mia," the wonderful music and coloi
of "The Eo of St gnes," the deft
and eerie handling of ballad theines'l
"La Belle ame sans Merci" and "Isa
bella; or The Pot of Basil," the oer
flowing dreaminess of midsummer in
the "Ode to a Nightingale," the depth
and lyric directness of such lines as
"I a rear Nlgnted ecember," and a
who!e antholojry of noble sonnets in
terpreting life and nature— these are
but a' moiety of the oerflowing stream
of his passionate imaginings, for hi
him the intellectual and the emotional
were kindly mixed In tbe face oJ
such a record of quod work the faults
of his earlier manner are not worth
consideration— Century

How Tweed Was Identified In Spain
by a Nast Cartoon
No ery strenuous effort had been
made to ]find Tweed, but it became
known at last that he was somewhere
in Spanish territory s early as Sept
30 Nast cartooned the "boss"  as a
tiger appearing from a cae marked
"Spain" Now, suddenly, came anoth
er report— a cable— that one "Twid"
(Tweed) had been identified and cap
tured at Vlgo, Spain, on the charge of
"kidnaping two merican children" £
' This seemed a curious statement, for
whateer may hae been the boss' sins
he had not been gien to child stealing
Then came further news, and the mys
tery was explained Tweed had been
identified and arrested at Vigo through
the cartoon "Tweedledee and Tilden
dum," drawn by Thomas Nast The
"street gamins"— to the Spanish office,
who did not read English— were two
children being forcibly abducted by the
big man of the stripes and club The
printing on the dead wall they judged
to be the story of his crime Perhaps 
they could een spell out the word fre
ward" hi an upper corner '
bsurd as it all was, the identifica
tion was flawless Tweed, on board
the steamer Franklin, came back to
merica to die When his baggage
was examined it was' found that he
had presered eery cartoon Nast had
drawn of him, sae the few final ones
published after his escape, one of
which had placed him again behind
prison bars On Oct 1 Harper's re
published this picture with the story of
the boss' capture The pictorial drama
was complete— lbert Blgelow Paine

 REFORM MOVE
The irect Legislation League,
with headquarters at Los ngeles,
has entered upon a campaign to se
cure from the next legislature the
passage and submission to ' the peo
ple of a" constitutional amendment
proiding for the initiatie and
referendum in state, county and
municipal legislation Much may be
truthfully said against the proposi
tion to hae laws, before goiuj into
effect, submitted to a direct ote of
the people It is no doubt a slow
and roundabout way of passing
laws But many thoughtful men
are coming to the conclusion that it
affords the only plan of checking the
passage of wild and immature
measures with which the state is
flooded eery two years It must be
confessed that many laws now cum
ber the statute books of the state,
and ordinance books of eery coun ty,
which would probably neer hae
become laws if the final approal
thereof had been required of the
people When laws are referred
back to the oters, it secures dis
cussion of the merits or demerits of
the measures, the adocates and
opponents get to thinking and talk
ing, and the newspapers entilate
the points in issue, so that before a
ote is taken the people are enabled
to form an opinion intelligently s
it is now, laws are passed without
any such opportunity being gien
The referendum would reliee the
honest legislator of much responsi
bility which he now has to shoulder
t the same time it would be a
stumblingblock in the path of the
unscrupulous lawmaker It is only
the political schemers, who can work
out their own selfish ends under ex
• isting conditions, that would be
 shorn of their streogth by the pro
posed plan of lawmaking The peo
ple of mador can readily see how
they might be benefitted, by the
referendum Take the justices' and
constables' salary law for instance
Will any one contend that that
measure would pass the gauntlet of
a popular ote Furthermore, does
any one suppose that it will be
speedily wiped from the statute
book's under the present system?
nother case in point might be men
tioned — our present road system
It has been the law for many years
The system of a superisor holding
the paid office of road commissioner
has neer worked satisfactorily It
is conceded that it neer will be
satisfactory nd yet no effort ' is
made to change it How long would
it stand if the people had the power
to demand that it pass muster at
the ballot box, or be declared oid
In our own lawmaking body in
mador county, we hae an example
in the present license law The er
dict of the people at the last election
clearly indicates that the changes
effected in this direction by the
superisors this year would not be
upheld The requirements exacted
are irksome and oppressie, without
any corresponding public benefit
The referendum would tend to check
such illdigested efforts at law
making The legislatie bodies hae
drifted to the extreme of making
laws to suit their owu notions The
people are beginning to realize that
it is about time they asserted their
own right to hae a final oice in
the matter 1 s 
THE WORKING OF UNWISE LI
CENSE LWS V
The ultimate object of all laws
should be the benefit of the mass
es ll enterprises of an educational
character, and all tests of skill of a
harmless nature should be encour
aged as much as possible If the
mere raising of money were the main
object of goernment, that could be
attained perhaps by a much less
complex and expensie system than
our present reenue laws But the
welfare of the community at large is
the main thing to be kept in mind
in the enactment of all laws ny
scheme of getting money into the
treasury that in its practical opera
tion tends to keep out capital, or
preent the starting up" of new
aenues of business, should be aoid
Ed, whether by state or county legis
latie bodies it matters not The idea
that a county goernment should
be shaped to restrict business to
actual resideuts of the county is
pernicious It may and does work
well when applied to the nation at
large, in the protectie tariff system
of the republican party, but to at
tempt to erect a barrier in faor of
the insider and against the outsider
of any town or county, by clapping
on an unjust license, is bound to be
in the long run detrimental to the
county's welfare Business pros
perity consists in the actie circula
tion of money in a community
through ths customary aenue of
trade The more the dollars change
hands, the better it is from a busi
ness standpoint When the artisan,
the laborer, and the professional
men cling to their earnings, from
whateer cause, business is dull, and
hard times preail There may still
be plenty of money in the com
munity, hut the fact that it is kept
idle, afraid to in est, or prohibited
from inestment by unwise enact
ments, is just as detrimental as
though there were an actual im
poerishment of the people Hence
the need of legislation to encourage
inestment in eery legitimate
manner
 few days ago Henry Chapman
made arrangements to open up a
shooting gallery in Jackson He
rented premises, and spent seeral
days in fixing up for business He
made a trip to the city, and pur
chased his outfit ll this was done
under the impression that a moder
ate license fee would be demanded
for such an enterprise There cer
tainly is nothing immoral, nothing
that ought to be discouraged, in a
shooting gallery Indeed, from the
iewpoint of national defense, such
enterprises ought' to be liberally
dealt with by the local managers
Our national and state goernments
spend millions'of dollars annually in
efforts to keep citizens up to a high
standard of markmanship What
would it matter if the proprietor of
a^ gallery managed to pack away
seeral hundred dollars from the
town as the outcome of his enture
The profits would be fairly earned,
and no harm would be done to either
indiidual or county But Chapman
miscalculated the spirit of our local
goernment On applying for a
license he found that $25 per" month
was the price for doing such a busi
ness He figured the pros and cons
of the proposition, and reached the
conclusion that mador county was
not a good field for his enterprise
He pulled up stakes and departed
for some other place where the pow
ers that be are satisfied with a more
reasonable fee for the priilege of
trying to earn an honest lielihood
By oerdoing the license mador is
out aud injured to the extent of a
liing license rate, some property
holder is out for rent, hotels are out
of the price of board and lodging,
business houses lose the profit on
ammunition and other supplies, and
the boys are depried of the pastime
of trying to improe in the direction
of target practice We grabbed for
too much, and lost the whole cheese
The president's message presented
to congress this week is a state
document of more than ordinary im
portance It is rather lengthy, but
deals with all matters of national
moment in a igorous and states
manlike manner There is hardly a
question of any consequence before
thepeople that it does not discuss
It takes firm grounds for the up
building of the nay, contending
that a strong fighting force on the
sea is the best and most economical
way of guaranteeing peace It takes
up the naturalization and registra
tion laws, holding for a more uuiform
method of regulating such questions
No radical changes are adocated in
the tariff, nor in the treatment of
the Phillipines, nor in the isthmian
canal question It does recommend
a sweeping cut in the printing of
public documents by the goern
ment It claims that one half of
this expense might be dispensed
with without any injurious effect,
thereby effecting a saing of hun
dreds of thousands of dollars of use
less expense There is no doubt that
this iew will receie popular in
dorsement, and it is to be hoped
that it will be faorably acted upon
by congress ltogether the mes
sage is an able paper, and is highly
spoken of by the press generally

OLET ITEMS
Noer before, according to the mem
ory of our oldest residents, hae
Oletaites enjoyed spring weather dur
ing the months of October and Noem
ber On some of the nearby cattle
ranges the wild flowers seem to be get
ting ready to bloom The greater part
of the summer fallow has been sown,
and the grain is growing rapidly, and
from present indications haying ought
to bogin about the first of February or
March
Grant Shroeder, youngest son of H
Shroeder, our old reliable merchant, is
expected home from Gait in a fow days
Grant has been clerking for Whitaker
& Ray in their largo department storo,
and is considered a firstclass salesman
We'understand it is his intention to
purchase a half interest in his father's
store and take unto himself a life partner
from among our choice selection of
girls, and settle down permanently in
Oleta We hope all rumors concern
ing the young man's intentions aro
true, for he is a worthy son of highly
respected parents
Owing to sickness Miss Mary Billalon
was compelled to remain at home dur
ing the late teachers' institute at San
Jose, thereby missing what she con
siders the opportunity of a lifetime
Tho mining industry seems to hae
taken a new start during tho last
month, and preparations aro boiug
made on seeral claims to work quite
extensiely during tho wintor months
The Pigeon Bros, hae moed all
necessary machinery and supplies onto
their claim one mile northwest of town,
and will put on a good force of men in
a few days
Clark & Mayon aro running a 1200
foot tunnel to tap a largo grael bed,
and they expoct to reap a golden har
est by early spring
S K Thornton, who forraorly
operated a mine in Shonandoah alloy,
has purchased a claim near, town, and
has quite a crew of men working at
present They hae already taken out
some ery rich ore From prosent in
dications Mr Thornton seoms to think
that he has found a little bonanza
Taking eerything iuto consideration
our little town seems moro choerful
than for seeral years past With
grass in abundance, employment for
all the men, and a ready sale for eery,
thing that can be produced, wo would
consider it unreasonable to complain,
and selfish to ask for more Oleta

MINING NEWS
Kennedy— The new forty stamp
addition to the mill was started up last
Monday' Like all new machinery 'of
this kind, it will take a little time to
get it into smooth and satisfactory
working order The mill is working
as nicely as could bo expected, and
probably before these lines are read the
100 stamps will be in steady operation,
crushing to their full capacity The
working force is being added to, but
the maximum limit will no doubt re
quire a considerable increase to the
underground workers
rgonaut— We are pleased to be
able to announce that the 0stamp mill is
being put in readiness for actie opera
tions, after a period of idleness extend
ing oer a number of years, consequent
upon the litigation between tho rgo
naut and Kennedy J Since the suit was
finally decided by the supreme court of
the United States in faor of the rgo
naut, the work of sinking the shaft and
opening up tho ore bodies in lower
leels has been steadily prosecuted In
the sinking the shaft has been carried
down to a depth 0f 2580 feet, and the
last set of timbers will probably be
placed next Sunday Leels hae been
opened at 1500, 1600, 1700 and 1800 feet,
and a good ore body encountered in
each, and from these leels tho rock
to keep the mill in steady operation
will be taken Something like 2000
tons of ore has been accumulated on
the dumps In two weeks more the
sound of tho stamps is expected to be
heard once more This addition to
Jackson's mining industry, together
with the additional milling capacity of
the Kennedy, ought to insure liely
times in this camp for years to come
Wendling Lumber Company Not Interested
 statement was made in the Ledger

Tho Lodger has receied a letter from

Kennedy mine Marbitto was no doubt
in earnest in applying for work They
went to the east shaft, and thence took
a trail oer the hill toward the Oneida

spot faorable for their purpose, the
three men pounced upon Marbitto, and
took $180 in cash and his nickel watch,
alued at $5 He had $100 of the
money in a belt around his waist, and
$80 tied around tho calf of his leg

according to ono story, the men tied the
ictim's hands and foot, leaing him
just 20 cents as his own share in the
diision of the money He was liber
ated by some miners returning from

WGON GOES OVER GRE
Two Horses Killed and rier Seerely
Injured
Saturday last Frank Tabeaud, em
ployed in driing one of Piccardo's big
tenanimal teams, met with an acci
dent which came near ending fatally to
him His wagon was loaded with a
heay mortar from the Baliol mine,
which he was in process of hauling to
the Hambley mine in Calaeras county,
proceeding by way of Hunt's gulch and
Middle Bar t a point in Hunt's
gulch, near where tho old Kelly mill
once stood, there is a sharp bend in the
road, and the roadway is ery narrow
also, making it a dangerous place for a
big heaily loaded team Tabeaud
had traeled the road frequently, and
is one of the most careful driers  The
load weighed seeral tons, and the
truck on which it was mounted was
aboe the aerage size t the point
named, Tabeaud tried to make the turn
with six animals,  hitching the other
four behind the wagon, aud himself
seated on one of the wheelers The
wheel approached to the edge of the
gulch, and the ground being unsup
ported, the wagon tilted, and before
Tabeaud was awaro that anything was
amiss, the whole outfit was precipitated
into the gulch, forty feet below the
road The four animals behind broke
the halter and managed to escape The
six in front were carried with the
freight into the gulch nother team
chanced to 1)6 a short distance behind,
and when he came to the spot hastened
to the rescue, with what assistance he
could get Tabeaud was found pinned
underneath his riding animal, which
was killed outright The drier was
extricated, and coneyed to bis home
in Jackson, where he has been confined
to his bed since No bonos were broken,
but he is suffering considerably, and
may hae sustained internal injuries
One of the other animals was seerely
hurt, and died soon afterward The
wreck lay in the gulch seeral days
Piccardo's loss by this misfortune will
foot up in the neighborhood of $500
The Railroad
The large locomotie for the loe
and Eastern railroad arried in Loili a
few days ago fter undergoing a
little needed repairs it will be forwarded
to its destination at lone, and engage
in the construction work of the road
Some 275 men aro now at work on the
railroad, with about 200 horses It is
now claimed that when Martoll's sta
tion is reached, the road will bo con
tinued, without delay, both toward
Sutter Creek and Jackson Tho talk
of the new enterprise, said to bo backed
by the Western Pacific, from Sacra
mento to Sutter Creek, will act as a
spur to this company to extend its line
along the mineral belt in order to tap
the large and growing trado of that
section It must depend upon this
trade for its financial success, and can
not afford to let any portion slip from
its grasp for,a few additional miles of
road
The project of extending the railroad
to the timber country has been reied
by the isit last Sunday of a number of
business men to spy out the country
to the east The party consisted of
  McCall, Ben Holt and W H
Braden of the Holt' Manufacturing
Company of Stockton, T  Chichi
zola of the mador Lumber Company,
and  B Buer of the  B and  L
Stone Company of Oakland This isit
is heralded by some as the forerunner
of railroad construction By others it
is regarded as a preliminary stop to
the introduction of the traction engino
in the hauling' o'f lumber in the eastern
section of mador

The Sr Staples' Case
Tho country has been flooded with
descriptie circulars of r F N
Staples and Mrs Hoxie, who fled from
San Francisco lately on tlPersonale appearance
of an item in tho papers there that the
body of the late Mrs Staples hail been
exhumerl, iiml'th^ itornauh roulents
sent, to an hxpert chemist of PPersonalin Fran
cisco for analysis Tli \ ait? aul  ili
madur county on a charge of murder
So far nothing has boon heard of thnir
whereabouts They hae dropped out
of sight The sheriff's office a few da ys
ago receied a communication from a
constable in a small lowa town, inclosing
a clipping from the ubuque Telegraph
of Noember 20, 190 The paper gies
an account of a diorce suit in which
r Staples is plaintiff It does not
gie the initials of the doctor in the
extract, but the constable In the ac
companying letter does It seems that
the diorce case is a contested one,
Mrs Staples haing filed a cross com
plaint, which soon after its filing was
taken away, and has not been, and, it
is said, will not be returned It appears
that Mrs Staples left her home in lowa
last spring, and thereafter wrote her
husband that she would not return
She went to Bauff, lberta, Canada
She alleged that incompatibility of
temper, inability to agree on household
affairs, and other matters preented her
returning On the receipt of Consignment this letter,
suit for diorce was commenced The
article coneys the idea that there is a
good deal of secrecy about the case; the
attorneys refusing to discuss any of its
phases The matter of contest appears
to be in regard to alimony Steps are
being taken to ascertain if the r
Staples, who is suing for diorce, is the
same person who is wanted in this
county on the murder charge
Inquiry leads to the conclusion that
the r Staples concerned in this suit is
not the fugitie from mador We
this week receied a marked copy of
the Farmington Chronicle, Maine, re
publisbing the articles from the Ledger
bearing on this case Farmington is
near Templo, where r and the late
Mrs Staples formerly lied The
people there, judging from the local
paper, are greatly exercised oer the
sensational deelopments

Big Freight for Standard Electric
Tho first load of the heay electric
machinery for the new power line of
tfne Standard Electric Company at
Electra passed through Jackson Wed
nesday at, noon It consisted of one
piece, weighing 9 tons, comprising one
of the three transformers This mas
sie ironwork stood 7 feet high and about
 feet square It was mounted on one of
the heay trucks, with sqlid lumber
wheels imported by the company for
this special work It required 18
animals to moe it as far as Jackson,
and would probably need more leerage
before it reached its destination at the
plant The eteran drier, Jack
uf rene, with his best team, undertook
the hauling Hundreds,' of people
gathered pn Main street to witness
making the sharp turn at the junction
of Wator and Broadway streets No
hitch occurred It made the turn as
easily as an ordinary log team The
team, load and driers were photo
graphed by Geo McMillan on Main
street This is only a bagatelle com
pared to other loads yet tQ come It
is said that'pieces of machinery weigh
ing between 20 and 30 tons are expected
shortly This 9$ ton piece was sufficient
to break one of the solid granite blocks
in tho crossing in front of the Ledger
office building
 ogGone Case
 jury was impaneled in Justice
Gold tier's court last Wednesday to
wrestle with a dog case The dqg is
dead, and therein lieq the cause of the
trouble The defendant was a man
named Coleman from Campo Seco, and
the complaining witness George Green
wood It seems in ugust last Cole
pan, his wife and a child, were driing
in a surrey from Campo Seep tp_ ffacltPersonal
son This side of Middle Bar,' acbo'rd
ing to the ersion gien by the defense,
the buggy was stopped, and occupants
alighted for a brief space Then the
dog came into tho story, barking and
scaring the child Coleman tried to
drie it away by snapping his whip
The dog kopt up his yelping Coloman
then got a rillo from the buggy and
blazed away twice, aimlessly, to scare
away the animal Still he" persisted
Finally Coleman fired for business, and
the dog went away howling, and after
ward died from the gunshot wound
The prosecution contended that the
killing was done malicipusly; that tho
firing occurred while the buggy was in
motion; that it was witnessed by two
boys, who testified to that effect
Greenwood wanted the shooter to pay
the alue of tho dog, or gie good
reasons for shooting it efendant
would do neither lie nee the suit for
malicious misobiof The jury after a
brief deliberation rendored a erdict of
not guilty C H Crocker appeared
for the defendant, while the district
attorney conducted the prosecution

THE NEGRO ILECT
Some Comments on Paul Laurence
iiiitmr'H Efforts to Sustain It
"s a rule the negro who has grown
out of the dialect of his race makes an
extremely poor showing in an effort to
mimic the negro's talk," said an ob
serant man, "and his efforjs to write
it are een more pronounced faHures
But Paul Laurence lumbar, the negro
poet, has written at least one thing In
which lie sustained the dialect of hie
race In the 'eath Song unbar got
closer to the talk and the nature of the
negro than in any other effort It is
worth recalling, so here It isPersonal
"Lay me down beneaf de wlllers in de
grass,
Whah do branch '11 go asingln' as it pass
u' w'en I's alayln' low
I kin hyeah it as It so
Slngln', "Sleep, my honey, tek yo' res' at
las''
"Lay me nigh to whah hit meks a little
pool
n' de watah stan's so quiet lak an' cool,
Whah de little birds In spring
Ust to come an' drink an' slug,
n' the chlllen waded on dey way tc
school
"Let me settle w'en my shouldahs draps
dcy load
Nigh enough to hyeah de noises in de
road,
Fu' I t'lnk de las' long res'
Gwine to soothe my sperrit bes'
Ef I's layin' 'mimg de things I's allus
knowed
"You will obsere here that he shows
the negro's strong deotion to the 'i,'
and it is interesting because of the
tendency on the part of writers of ne
gro dialect to force the T out by the
substitution of 'a' unbar's use of 'Is
for the improper 'I is' Is genuine Most
negro dialect writers of today would
write it 'h's,' for they nearly always
use 'h' for 'I' So he shows the same
preference for 'i' in the lines 1
"n' w'en I's alayln' low
I kin hyeah It as it go
Slngin', 'Sleep, my honey, tek yo' res' at
las'' J •  •
"Here we hae T's' and T kin,' both
showing the negro's deotion to the
sound of 'I' So he uses 'gwine' for 'go
ing,' probably errs in the distinctie
'gwin to,' for the negro, as a rule, will
make one word out of the phrase, gi
ing it more the sound of 'gwinter' But,
on the whole, the dialect is good and
Is well sustained" — New Orleans

POINTE PRGRPHS
Onehalf the stuff you buy does you
no good
on't carry a lot of keys to priate
drawers Burn papers you don't want
seen ; 
 dollar is a large amount to pay for
bread, but it is mighty insignificant in
a poker game
When some people haen't any great
trouble, they smile as much as to say,
How brae I am!
Many a good man fusses a great
deal about nothing and makes himself
unnecessarily disagreeable
There is this in being a parentPersonal They
get the abuse if their children are bad
and no particular credit if they are
good— tchison Globe
Fife Thousand istinct Languages
Mr J Collier is authority for the
statement that there are no less than
5,000 distinct languages spokeu by
mankind The number of separate dia
lects is enormous There are more
than sixty distinct ocabularies in Bra
zil, and in Mexico the Nahua language
has been broken up into 700 dialects
There are hundreds in Borneo The
complexities are beyond classification
in ustralia, and generally the num
ber of dialects decreases with the in
tellectual culture of the population If
there is an aerage of fifty dialects
to eery language we still hae the
enormous total of 20000
Burying the Inn Sign
In some parts of England when a
public house loses its license the sign
board is solemnly buried On the last
night it is remoed from oer the door
and "waked" in the bar by the old
customers When the clock points to
closing time and the house ceases its
career as an inn the signboard Is car
ried out in procession and interred
with an appropriate burial serice,
which ends with watering the grae
with a gallon of beer or a bottle of
whisky
NothingPersonal to Fear
Judge Rockwood Hoar, brother of
Senator Hoar, was noted as a wit as
Well as a jurist Shortly before his
death, as his daughter entered his
room in the morning, he saidPersonal "My
dear, I had a dream last night, and in
it I saw the angel of death sitting at
the foot of my bed t first I was
horribly frightened, but as I gazed at
toy isitor my fears anished He
wore a fur cap"— Brooklyn Life
The Opportunity
It was night
They— he and she— were sitting on
the porch looking at the stars
"You know, I suppose," he whis
pered, "what a young man's priilege
is when he sees a shooting star?"
"No," she answered "I haen't the
slightest Idea There goes one!"— Ch

"Godfrey— Godfrey— Godfrey de Bou

GRET THOUGHTS
Tber Hae the Gift of Immortal
Youth und StreiiKth
Tbe Influence of tlie law of action
and reaction can be traced more clear
ly in those eeryday buuian affairs
which come under our indiidual ob
seration than in the greater aioe
ments of mankind which are often im
perfectly recorded We act and are
acted upon The people we meet make
an impression on us; the impression
may be for the moment or it may last
through life Bloom, fragrance, grace,
harmony, beauty, majesty, affect U3
agreeably; deformity, imbecility, dis
tress, cruelty, affect us unpleasantly
The plea of the unfortunate, the
thought of our isitor, tho opinion in
the newspaper, the Issues of the time,
Impress us in accordance with our
moods or natures Certain words, tones,
eights, awaken echoes within us of old
happiness or pain
There are words and tones which
produce beautiful reactions— the lulla
bies of the mother, tho endearments of
the loer, the oice of sympathy, the
enchantment of music, the messages
of the poets, the trumpet calls to hon
orand duty nd there are words
which produce misunderstanding, con
fusion, aersion, anger— the words of
whining, complaining, fault finding, of
eny, jealousy, slander, of malice, in
tolerance, brutality
The response to the public speaker is
reciprocal to his power If he bo dull,
the hearers are wearied; if he be con
incing, courageous, forceful, the au
dience will kindle, and he may rouse
them to laughter or tears, to indigna
tion or fury, to generosity or sacrifice
He may change the opinions and con
ictions of some and the course of the
lies of others; he may een sae a
city from slaughter or make a state
If his thought be really great, it may
lie through many ages, stirring gen
eration after generation The reaction
of moral effort may be prolonged; it
may een gain force with time, indi
cating its connection with some stu
pendous primal energy The echo of a
great physical conulsion dies quickly,
but the echo of the words of Confu
cius and Buddha, of Plato, Seneca and
Christ, still lies The oice of Socrates
before his judges kindles men whose
ancestors were untamed saages when
Socrates spoke Buildings decay, mon
uments fall, riers run dry, races de
cline, but a great thought suffers from
no impairment or decrepitude; it has
the gift of immortal youth and
strength— From "BalancePersonal The Funda
mental Verity," by Orlando J Smith
Why Some Folks Go to Europe
When New York society doesn't know
what else to do it goes abroad n
ambitious woman gets wind of some
rial's intended function Not to be
inited or not to be seen among the
guests means a slight easily endured
If the world be not cognizant of tho
fact, but Intolerant If it is; therefore
the ambitious woman sails away to
Europe She may not be gone six
weeks, but her absence is thus to be
accounted for In other cases it la
known that society takes this absent
treatment to cure heart troubles, to es
cape social obligations that weigh too
heaily on tho income or, again, from
sheer ennut departs This restless
ness of certain sets in society would
be dangerous were it not for the safety
ale which that really oerworked
tlantic ocean has become of lato
years When all else falls, go to Eu
rope—Boston Herald
The Beautiful
Beauty preails in spite of all we
do We may build ugly buildings, we
may think ugly thoughts, we may
wrinkle ourseles in worries or the
contemplation of ugliness, we may
een worship ugliness 'under the name
of utility, but lightly, without an ef
fort, the gentle • hand of beauty de
scends upon all Seauty may do her
subtle work in many ways Sun, moon,
fog and rain are alike her serants
The fresh red houses, garish eyesores
in the sun, become wonderful as they
loom blood red before the man in the
mist, or in a few years the red Is
quieted, and the searching light only
makes it more beautiful— rthur Kan
some
 Conersion
 country circus adertised that "at
12 o'clock the cannibals will be fed"
 large crowd assembled, but to eery
body's disappointment the saages ate
potatoes In reply to some indignant
questions the manager said'Personal "But, gen
tlemen, don't you see that their diet
is eidence of my skill? I hae con
erted, them into egetarians"—Flie
gende Blatter
The SelllHli Man
 bachelor one day set the table in
his lonely abode with plates for him
self and an imaginary wife and fie
children He then sat down to dine,
and as ho helped himself to fooU he
put the same quantity on each of the
other plates and sureyed the prospect,
at the same time computing the cost
He Is still a bachelor
The Game of Life
Life is a queer game of blind man's
buff, played In a mist on a mountain
topi nnd the players keep dropping oer
" o precipices But nobody heeds be
Miise there are always plenty more,
and the game goes on foreer — H

THE HOTEL BREKFST
how the merican Bleal ppears an
an Englishman
The merican hotel breakfast is
representatie of the general delight Id
good liing The length of the menu
and the ariety of the dishes bespeak
an appetite that in the early morning
can relish a meal little less substantial
than a dinner
The hotel breakfast begins with fruit
—grape fruit if it happens to be in sea
son, the bitter sweetness of which
seems designated by nature to awaken
the appetite nd there Is really a be
wildering problem when next you are
asked to choose among the cereals—
from the old fashioned oatmeal to all
kinds of predlgested preparations
Cooked oysters in eery style are of
fered on the menu, and een In the best
restaurants a plate of oysters cobts
only a shilling The choice of fish can
be made from a long list— of kinds un
known In England, Including weakfish,
blueflsh and shad, with its delicate roe
It must be out of compliment to Eng
lish traelers that herring and haddock
are imported You see them ery sel
dom on an merican breakfast table
When boiled eggs are eaten they are
opened by the waiter into a glass, no
small quantity of butter being added—
salt butter, for "sweet" butter Is sel
dom sered With chops or steak the
merican, who neer eats cold meats
at breakfast, usually orders potatoes,
and the meal may be brought to a close
with pancakes These hot cakes, which
are made of wheat, buckwheat, rice or
cornmeal, are eaten smothered In ma
ple sirup, a delicious treacle obtained
from the sap of maple trees
The  merican drinks coffee for
breakfast— such a coffee as you may
find in Paris, but not in London — and
that he does not prefer tea would need
no other explanation than the failure
to understand the art of making It

THE FIRST PIE PLTES
They Were Hade by the German
Fottera of Philadelphia
The first pie plates were made early
In the eighteenth century by the Ger
man potters who settled In Philadel
phia
fter the clay was prepared It waß
cut Into small pieces by means of a
brass wire and taken to the work
bench to be made Into plates
The clay was roughly beaten Into a
flattened form looking like a colossal
buckwheat cake This was rolled out
into a thin sheet with a roller much
like a rolling pin, and then a disk
cutter was used to cut It Into circu
lar pieces of the required diameter
This bat, as It was called, was then
laid on a board until partly dry and
was then decorated
The slip decoration was applied by
means of a slip cup, an earthen essel
with goose quills Inserted Into the
openings, through which the liquid
slip was made to trickle oer the ware
in a ariety of patterns, just as icing
is applied to cake at the present time
The slip mixture was of a creamy col
or made of white clay and water
Faorite moties for decorations
were flowers, fruits and scenes, tulips
being a special pet
 Lutheran minister asked his potter
to dine with him to discuss designs for
a set of plates he wished to order
s the potter was accustomed to dine
at 12, he was almost famished when
the clergyman's 2 o'clock dinner was
sered When the set of plates came
home, each with a pious sentiment In
terwoen among the marginal decora
tions, the minister laughed to find an
extra plate, bearing this InscriptionPersonal "I
hae neer been at a place where
they dine so late" So much for Penn

cried the Infuriated soldier and prompt
ly knocked Lemaltre Into the orchestra
t this there was a terrific din, and
the soldier began to see that the in

lar But Lemaltre, when he regained
the stage, took the gendarme by the
hand and saidPersonal "Excellently well done,

Hats, Boots and Weak Hearts
Mrs Nolan had made some disparag
ing remarks about the costume of her
husband's bosom friend, Mr Herllby,
and they were promptly resented
" 'His hat Is turning green wld age,'
Is It?" said Mr Nolan, with fine scorn,
"and 'his boots Is rusty and cracked
lookin',' did I hear ye say? Listen now
