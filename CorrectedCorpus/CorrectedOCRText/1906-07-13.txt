THE STPLES' MURER CSE
Judgmen of eah Reersed by
Supreme Cour—  New Trial
Ordered
Wednesday morning, W J McGee,
he aorney who has had charge of
he case of F N Saples, on appeal
before he supreme cour, receied a
elegram from he clerk of ha
ribunal announcing ha he cour
had rendered a decision reersing he
judgmen of he lower cour, and
ordering a new riul The case has
been pending before he higher cour
since Noember las i was argued
and submied in he early par of
he year, and paries ineresed bad
been expecing a decision a any
momen or seeral weeks The long
delay creaed au impression ha he
case was anyhiug bu a clear one
from he prosecuion's sandpoin, and
ha a reersal was more han pro
bable Oher murder cases submied
een afer he Saples' case, had been
decided, and in eery insance he
judgmen of be rial cour was
upheld The "hanging fire" in his
paricular case was aken o mean
ha a couiary decision would be he
oucome i be Saples maer
On receiing he elegram, W J
McGee repaired o be couny jail,
and was a once admied o he pre
sence o be prisoner under senence
of deah The documen announcing
ihe glad idings ha he life of he
defendan was relieed, emporarily
a leas from forfeiure o he majesy
of offended law, was read o him
He was glad of course, bu made no
demonsraions of joy such as migh
be eSpeced of one in his predicmen
He simply remarked, "Tha's prey
good" The aorney said, "Well,
le us shake on i," and he wo
grasped hands cordially
Saples was no a surprised man a
he good news Indeed, he would
hae been grealy surprised a any
oher oucome He saed, ha i
was only wha he had expeced all
along when he maer was looked
ino by disineresed and imparial
men He was asked i be waned o
send word o his friends, and he
answered 'yes ' Two elegrams were
wrien ou, announcing merely ha
he cour bad graned a new rial
One was sen o defendan's faher,
in Farmingou, Maine, aud he oher
o Mrs Emily Maud Hoxie, who was
indiced wih be defendan for com
pliciy in be murder of Mrs Saples,
for which he husband was coniced
This was sen o Piacerille, where
Mrs Hoxie is engaged in he millinery
business
I was circulaed around ha ne
defendan held a soi of leee in jail
in he eening, aud receied con
yraulaious from isiors, male and
female We are able o say ha noh
ing of be kind occurred Saples is
quie bandy as a skech aris He had
made some picures aud gieu hem
o paries in own He also promised
samples o his handicraf in his line
o ohers ccording o prior ar
augpinen hree ladies called Wed
nesday eening for hese picures
The meeing had nohing whaeer o
cio wih he appeal proceedings, and
hnPersonali no bearing on he news o he
graning of a new rial
The reersal of he judgmen of
conicion was iully anicipaed bj
mos people Nowihsanding, i
was one of bo longes and coslies
rials eer held in mador couny,
any oher decision by he appellae
cour would hae proed a sore dis
appoinmen aud surprise o he
people generally The feeling was
abroad bn Saples ough o hae a
new rial Tha he crime had no
b>en fasened upon him o he exen
o warraning he hiking of human
lifo
The full ex of be supreme cour
decision has no been receied We
will prin i a he earlies possible
momen I is of much ineres o
know on wha paricular ground lie
reersal of he mador cour is based
I is generally supposed ha he
inheren weakness of he eidence o
suppor ho erdic is he main
sumbling sone
If his should proe o be he poin
on which he reersal binges, s
he preailing opinion ha i will be
conclusie o he whole maer I
would be useless o no o rial again
in he face of such a decision, unless
oher and sronger eidence can be
produced, which is no probable

The man urned a face upon him

in is wrah Wih his angle of
golden hair, his fierce blue eyes, and
his large, wellmarked feaures, he
was he mos comely man whom l
leyne had eer seen; and ye here was
somehing so siniser and so fell in his
expression ha child or beas migh
well hae shrunk from him His brows
were drawn, his cheek flushed, and
here was a mad sparkle in his eyes
which spoke of a wild, unamable
naure
"Young fool!" he cried, holding he
woman sill o his side, hough ery

abhorrence "I rede you o go on your

ino he broad brown hand which held
her He whipped i back wih an oah,
while she ore herself free and slipped
behind lleyne, cowering up agains

"Sand off my land!" he man
said fiercely, heedless of he blood
which rickled freely from his fingers
"Wha hae you o do here? By your

"If you leae me now," whispered he
woman, "shame foreer upon your

"Surely, sir," said lleyne, speaking
In as persuasie and soohing a way
as he could, "If your birh Is genle,

His elder broher dashed his hand
aside wih an oah, while an expression
of malignan hared passed oer his

"I migh hae known i by he sleek

hrowing he lad o one side, caugh
he woman's wris lleyne, howeer,
as acie as a young deerhound,
sprang o her aid and seized her by
he oher arm, raising his ironshod

he said beween his clenched eeh —
"i may be no beer han I desere;
bu, broher or no, I swear by my
hopes of salaion ha I will break

There was a ring in his oice and a
flash in his eyes which promised ha

whisperings of he docrine of meek

The Socman sprang back, looking o

with the stuffing machine in a semi
fluid condition, and no water or grit
whatever is given to the fowls daring
this period, the semi-liquid food fur
nishing sufficient moisture for the
greatest improvement.
GREAT GAIN IN WEIGHT AND
QUALITY.
Fowls that are fed In this way gain
largely in weight For instance, a
fowl placed in the coop weighing three
pounds and a quarter, bones, feathers
and offal, would weigh from one and
a half to two pounds more when fin
ished, adding in this way two pounds
of edible meat to the carcass, and so
Improving the entire carcass as to add
from three to fbur cents per pound to
Its value over that of poultry of that
kind not so well finished. Thus, a fowl
weighing three pounds and a quarter,
worth 9 cents per pound, would sell for
thirty cents as it came from the
range. The same fowl, after being fed
three weeks, would weigh five and a
quarter pounds and sell for twelve
cents a pound at the lowest calcula
tion, which would be 63 cents for the
same carcass, after having been fed
for three weeks. The estimate placed
upon the cost of feeding is about ten
to twelve cents per head.
What is known as the yellow
skinned or yellow-meated poultry is
prime favorite in the markets of this
country. To intensify and beautify
the richness of these colors, meal made
from yellow corn is largely used in
the process of fattening. For the
English market, which Is largely
catered to by these packers, fowls
having the white color of flesh are pre
ferred. To intensify and improve this,
ground oats, meal from white corn,
and some finely ground rice is made
use of. To add luster, finish and
quality to all these, a small per cent
of melted tallow is mixed into the
warm mash, and fed in a semi-liquid
state the last four or five days of feed
ing.
The fattening of poultry with corn
adds fatty globules throughout the
entire carcass. A fowl that has been
fattened with corn Is usually what
might be termed greasy meat, white
poultry finished or fattened In this,
way lays on close or solid meat with
no globules of fat scattered through it
Crate and machine fattened poultry
sells for the highest prices of any
poultry sent to market.
A peculiarity in these conditions is
the fact that poor or inferior speci
mens cannot be successfully fattened
or finished in this way. Only the well
grown thrifty specimens can be profit
ably crate-fattened and improved in
weight and character of flesh. One
must understand thoroughly well the
process of handling poultry for this
purpose, or he cannot succeed. Where
it is well done and nicely finished and
prepared for market, poultry finished
in this manner is the most desirable,
both in this country and abroad.
PACKING FOR MARKET.
In packing for market, square boxes
that will hold 12, 24 and 48 chickens
are made use of. Fowls all of one
size and weight with the same ap
pearance are packed in one box. This
plan is of great advantage in selling.
Farmers and country people generally
lose a large amount of profit through
the carelessness in dressing and send
ins their fowls to market. When nice
ly graded and selected, all of one kind
in a package, both eggs and poultry
bring the highest prices. It is the
finest quality that makes the profit in
poultry growing. This is what the
large packing houses, which handle
Kindreds of thousands of fowls in this
way, aim to make of all they fatten. —
Cultivation of Garden Crops.
Frequent shallow cultivation should
be employed for most garden crops,
and during dry weather the depth
should not exceed 2 inches. By keep
ing the surface soil well stirred what
is termed a "dust mulch" is formed,
and while this layer of finely pulver
ized soil will become quite dry, it pre
vents the escape of moisture through
the pores of the soil. A mulch con
sisting of fine manure, clippings from
the lawn, or any similar material,
spread to a distance of 10 or 12 inches
around the plants will preserve the
moisture; but the mulch should not be
so heavy or matted as to exclude the
air.
A crust forming over the soil after
a rain or watering is detrimental to
plant growth and should be broken up
as soon as the land can be worked.
To determine when the soil is suf
ficiently dry for cultivation, apply the
same test of squeezing together in the
hand as is utilized in determining when
to plow. Sandy soils can be worked
much sooner than clay soils after a
rain. Too much importance cannot
be placed upon the matter of thorough
cultivation of the garden, and if the
work is promptly and properly done
there will be little difficulty in con
trolling weeds.
