BTORM IN THE SUMMER
; Storm in tbe dimmer's a mighty funny thing,
7Like-a woman's temper -when it takes a fling;
Cornea of a suddfp, and you don't know why;
J You itart in gnessipir, and it's all gone by; 
Bwiah and sweep, and it's in full blast;
You catch your breath, and it'a flown clear past;
* Tbnnder and lightning and sulphur in the air,
;"And the very next minute the sun ehincs fair!
And It's Just this way that the truth is shown
j Why" sweet Dame Katui • ia a woman known; "
• Btae can nurae her wrath through a mighty long
 truce, -,  ,
~But it breaks for keeps wlien it docs break looael
I |n J ahe storms like a tyrant and makes thine*
horn 
J fill its easy to believe that it's kingdom come,
*nd all of a sudden there's mercy in her eye,
 and she laughs and dimples, and the storm's gone
 by! , ,_

Old Parker's Ghost
M Quad
oomiiGHT, 1900, »r a b lewis
* That I really and truly saw a ghost
on a certain occasion Is a matter of le
gal record, and I believe It Is the only
ghost ever legally known to a commu
nity ;
I I was a boy of 11 when the family
emigrated from Ohio to Michigan and
BPttlpd In a town of 1,500 people There
bap! just died a citizen named John
Parker, who was always referred to as
old Parker He was one of the pio
neers of the  town, 'and his eccentrici
ties had greatly retarded Its growth"
No one ever learned where he came
from or anything about bis private
life '--He came alone, lived alone and
died alone- He was a queer looking
little old' man stoop* shouldered, of
shambling gait and there were days
-,when he refused tcr speak to any one
He bought 200 town lots and then re
fused to sell or lease He built a saw-
IT WAS THE LITTLE OLD MAN
mill, and the first lumber turned out
was wanted for the erection of a
church Because the old man was ask
,ed to make a discount in price In favor
at the Lord, as It were, he shut down
the mill, boarded up doors and win
dows, and the saws never turned again
He bought two stores and five or six
houses and shut them up and he
bought every improvement for the ben
efit of the town On the other band,
be lent men money at a low rate of in
terest to make Improvements, encour-
aged people to settle there and built
the first schoolbouse entirely at hig
own expense
While owning five or sis comforta
ble j- bouses, which were empty, old
Parker lived alone Id a miserable shan
ty and cooked and washed and mend-
Ed for himself No one was ever per
mitted to enter his bouse, and' be never
entered the home of any one else
There were a few men with whom he
would converse, but be did not give
f hem his confidence There was no
mourning In Red Oak when It became
known one morning that old Parker
had been found dead in his shanty
The feeling was rather one of relief
and congratulation It was soon ascer
tained that bis affairs were In a mud
die Be had left no will, and the pa
pers In the hands of bis lawyers did
not represent the half of bis posses
sions It was hardly a fortnight be
fore a brother and sister turned up,
each claiming the estate, and through
them It was learned that the old man
must have been possessed of at least
185,000 In gold when be died Of this
sum only about $200 could be found
The j town was  turned upside down
over the affair, and it bad got into
court when we moved Into the village
That was In midwinter As a boy, I
could pot understand or Interest my
jsf'tj)"li>e' jegal cpinpllcaOons "of the
case, but tbe fact that old Parker bad
biddep a big lot of gold somewhere
appealed to me very strongly The
sawmill and all bis bouses were search
ed, 1 , but no trace could be found
It was generally believed that be bad
burled It, but until tbe snow melted no
rffert could be made to find tbe cache
On the 14th day of March' with six
Inches of snow still on the ground I
went with my father Into tbe woods
Bfser a load, of wood- We had a yoke
of oxep and a sieuV'and when 'the first
Ipad" jyas heaped up my father drove
pff with It and left me behind to cut
flo#p $ dead, asl) and clear a row
•round a bit of a swamp
After be was out of sight I Bat down
on a log to watch a rabbit bopping
about! I may have spent five min
utes watching the animal when a
light noise at" my Tight startled me,
end I looked around to find old John
Parker Sitting- wl thin ten feet of me
He had "been described so often that
there could be no mistake It was the 
little old man with the stoop shoul
ders, the long  hair, the seedy gar
rhents, t{ie catskin cap be wore every
t}ay in tbe year ' He bad a dry hacking
cougb; tie bad bushy gray eyebrows;
h? bad missing teeth He sat there
tad rubbed bts skinny bands, together
and looked at the ground art his feet,
and I took in every detail as clearly
as you see this print before you '
Was I frightened? Strangely enough,
I was npt Perhaps this was because'
| had never Personal seen the old' mail when
living 'He looked so real before me
that 1, never thought of spooks or!
ghosts ' I slmrjy believed that hia
dying had been a jnistake^-that he had
gone away Instead qI dying I was no
more in fear of hlmHhan of the trees
about me I wondereda bit how he
could, hate  aonrQaciiefl^uifi- so closely

without, my having heard him, for the
snow had a frosty crust to It, but there
he was, and It was not long before I
said to himPersonal
 "Did you come out here to see my
father?" -
Old John did not look about, though
be continued to rub his hands I re
peated tbe question in a louder voice,
but the result was the same I looked
to see if he had an ax or a gun, but
nothing was in sight So far as I could
tell, he had not yet seen me and, feel
ing a bit embarrassed over the situa
tion, I rose up and moved over to make
my presence known I had started to
repeat my question, and my eyes were
full  on him, when ' he dissolved He
faded out of my eyes as a wet finger
mark fades from a school slate, and I
found myself looking at a snow cover
ed, log I looked for Uis tracks, but
there was none I looked for the spot
where be had sat, but the snow had not
been disturbed in tbe slightest I did
not bave a fit of tbe shivers and run
away It was a sunshiny day, and 1
thought tbe gin re on tbe snow bad in
some way played me a trick I had
the tree down and the road cleared
when father returned, and when 1 told
him of my strange visitor I expected
to be laughed nt Indeed, I laughed as
I told It, but father didn't He began
to question me very closely, and by
the time he had loaded tbe sled I could
see that he took the matter seriously
When we were ready to go, he asked
me to point out tbe exact spot where
old John had sat This was easy
enough to know, as my own tracks
were there In the snow The snow on
tbe log was piled* up and frozen bard,
but father soon cleared It off with the
ax Tbon be pounded on tbe log, found
it hollow and cut Into It He bad hard
ly struck 20 blows when there came a
sound to show that the ax bad struck
something besides 'wood, and five min
utes later we had old Parker's missing
gold out of the hollow log ,It was In
two tin hoses, and there were many
papers with It to clear up the mystery
of bis life and assist tbe heirs in set
tling up the estate They were gener
ous to me In settlement, and It was
part of the legal records of the county
that I snw a- ghost at 2 o'clock In the
nftrrnoon of a bright day and recover

Americans In Gngland
Whatever may be the points of con
trast between us, there Is no doubt that
Americans in ever increasing numbers

able hoyr piapy b^ve made permanent
homes In London  They like to live
there 
When an American has made a for
tune, be finds It almost impossible to
live quietly in his own country There
is something in the very atmosphere of
the Dnited States that makes people
wish to barn the candle at both ends
Over here they may subdue the Incan
descence to tbe veriest glimmer ' But
chief among the attractions that this
country has for Americans is that they
can escape tbe newspapers Here
wealthy persons can spend their money
as freely as tbey wish, and they still
remain private persons ;>
These are' some of tbe reasons why
the American colony In tbe British me
tropolis grows every year But there
Is a ; more; subtle reason ' Americans

talked to very many Americans, and
almost all of them admit, that in com
ing to England they are coming to 4

spect and love, where they expect to

forests on the Mauch Chunk mountain
While in quest of game for his family,
whom he had left at home without
food of any kind, his foot struck a
black stone By the roadside not far
from the town of Summit Hill he built
a fire of wood and threw pieces, pf tb,p
supposed, stone about (t so that 'the em
bers might last' longer while' he was
roasting a fowl He was surprised
after a little while, to see the stones'
glow and retain {heir heat for a long
time He carried a lot of the coal home
and burned it there The few neigh
bors soon learned of the discovery, but
there was no mining to any extent in

In the morning, when all thaw has
been stopped by the night's cold, there
Is deathly silence over the glacial fields,
even tbe mountain cataracts fall noise
lessly from the precipice to ledge In
tenuous, wind blown threads, But with!
tfce'rislng of the sun the whole glacial
world bursts to life In noisy tumult
Surface rivulets brawl over the ice
with a glee that is vocal and almost
human The gurgle of rivers flowing
through subterranean funnels becomes
a roar, as of 4 rushing, angry sea, lcp

THE DEATH BIRD
M QUAD
COPTKIOHT, 1900, BI a B LEWIS
Long-enough before I, a lieutenant of
Infantry, made my first trip across the
great Staked plains of Texas as an es
Personalort to a couple of civil engineers I had
heard of the death bird of the desert
No living man had ever seen It, but
there were plenty who bad l>-2rd its
iotes, and its notes always meant dan
ger - One might travel to and fro on
the Staked plains for a year and never
see a bird of any sort except about their
»dges The only living things to be
net with are serpents, lizards, scorpl
jns and skulking wolves The aridness
rod desolation are too much even for
the buzzards ;•!
The death bird, so the legend went,
appeared only at night, and then no
man saw him He came to give warn
ing His notes were peculiar, and no
hunter could Imitate him, but one hear
ing them in the silence pf the night and
the desert could make no mistake Be
fore making the trip an old hunter said
tomePersonal
"There ls_but one danger to look out
for— the Apaches They may follow
you clear across the desert They
will not attack yon by daylight, but at
night, without your having seen a sign
Df them, they will creep upon you as
softly as serpents and spare none Lis
ten for the notes of the death bird, and
when you bear them take instant warn
ing" -
There were 16 of us to the~party
Fourteen soldiers were supposed to -
constitute a force able to take care of
Itself anywhere There was more anx
iety as to our water and rations than
as to the Indians who might dog our
footsteps It was midsummer, and the
beat on that great surface of sand and
alkali soil was simply terrific After
the first day, when we were clear of
shelter, a march of six or eight miles
was all any one was capable of The
nights brought cool breezes and recu
peration, but they, also brought a lone
liness n<r person can describe Men
afloat on the wide ocean In a small
aoat hear strange sounds at night and
ire made afraid Men on the desert
are almost made cowards by the un
;anny surroundings  If there Is the
hirp of a cricket or the howl of a coy
ite, It Is not company It simply adds
to the loneliness If tbe night is unbro
ken, then it is as If a heavy blanket
bad bf,u thrown over your head to
abut out the living world
We saw nothing of Indians No one
believed that a party took our trail A
faithful watch was kept, however, but
after a few nights when I had come to
realize how helpless we really were I
found myself depending on that legend
Df the death bird If we were menaced,
he would warn us We had been out a
week when there enme the blackest of
black nights It was black because It
was moonless and a storm was gather
ing Our tents were set up In a clus
ter, hut they could not be seen at a dis
tance of six feet Three sentinels were
Dn duty, but they could not see the
sands at their feet If the Indians had
followed, there would never be a bet
ter night for a surprise It would be
do trick at all fo creep within stabbing
distance of the sentinels, and a volley
)f arrows and bullets sent through the
tents must wound or kill most of us
I was sifting in the" door of my tent
an hour after midnight wondering
how soon tbe storm would break, when
there came to me from a point not far
distant tbe notes of tbe death bird
They sounded a bit like the call of a
juall, and yet they were unlike They
were like words Instead of notes' They
were soff anc} cjea,r, ah 3 from the very
first they said to mePersonal
"Look out! Look out! Look out!
Danger! Danger! Danger! , 7 Death
Death! Death!" > , \
I repent that the bird seemed to, be,
talking lnstea^ of crying out in its' nat
ural notes I uiay have got this Idea
from my state of nervous apprehen
sion, but so it was I turned and woke
up the two sleeping engineers and ask
cd {o listen Tbey did not make
put words as I did, but one of then)
whisperedPersonal • Personal -
"That's a danger cry, or I never
heard one I tell you we are menaced
by some great peril!" Personal
Thrice tbe death bird called its notes,
and then all was silence as before A
soldier was sent creeping away to caU
to the sentinels 4 few rods to the'
north of us, as we had noticed ' when,'
going Into 'camp, the sands bad been
fpyed with, by some strong gale un\\)
tjie fldge's' almost, fprnied, a natural
fprt With the greatest care and in tbe
deepest silence we left tents and bag
gage, and, taking nothing but our wa
ter bottles and muskets, we crept out
of camp to tbe north and by and by
reached the fort It was so dark that
men had to be felt for Instead of spo
ken to,, but at the end' of half an' hour
we lay In line with our muskets resting
on a sand ridge and painting toward
camp One could te\\ by the feeling in
tfa,e '^ir that the  storm would soon
preafe and that the first break would be
a vivid flash of lightning The' men
were instructedtp_flre with the flash to
case It revealed Indians about
At last; when we were all In a'trem,'Personal
ble with anxiety, the flash'came' For a
few secon"ds*it was as if a great search
light had fallen upon the desert It
was so blinding that every eye \tas
closed for a second When opened,
they beheld a band of 20 Apacliea on
hands and knees within 25 feet of the'
tents A volley was fired" straight into,
their faces and a second as another

21 Indians We had fired without aim,
and the destruction wrought was due
to luck or accident, but there were 1(3
redskins lying dead on the Bands
around the camp  Among these were a

they brought peace for two years Said
one of tbe survivors to me afterwardPersonal
"We had planned to kill the entire
lot of you We heard the notes of the
death bird and knew you would hear
them also, but we didn't believe you
would understand the warning Had
you not understood and moved away
not a man of you would have escaped"
For many days subsequently— aye,
for many months and years— as I, was
posted along the desert or Journeyed
across It I looked for the death bird at
morning, noon and night, but I never
got sight of him His mission was to
fly only at night and to tell of peril
Why P|d They Mlssf
Hunterß' tales rarely make mention
of poor shots and failures, and a story
which depicts the remarkable ill suc
cess of some famous 'shots in Califor
nia a few years ago Is therefore all the
more Interesting The narrator, Mr
Frank Marryat, teems the Incident the
one marvelous \ale In his book, ''Moun
tains and Mojehllls" In former times
It would have passed for a nilracfc
Three of us were out at midday in
search of venison In the Santa Rosa
valley Tbe sky was cloudless and the
sun blazing hot Making for a shady
thicket, we unexpectedly started a doe
In the  long grass She was out of
range before we could raise a gun, b,ut
there still remained a fawn Th,e pret
ty Innocent stood perfectly still, gazing
at ua pur larder vfls bare, and we
coutd not afford to be merciful
The fawn stood motionless as I ad
vanced a few paces and took, as I fan
cied, deadly aim I missed, and still \\
did not move ! The others fired and
missed, also
From the same distance, about 75
yards, we fired each four bullets wltb^
out success Still tbe fawn moyed but
a pace or two, and our rifle ammunition
was exhausted - ' ''^i- j>
I then crept up to the fawn ana with
in 20 paces tired twice at It with my
pistol Then, unharmed, It quietly
walked away in search of its mother
We looked at each other in surprise
Fourteen shots within 70 paces of a
motionless deer! "Well, I'll be ban?,
ed!" -was one man's comment TOrack
shots!" '£££*•" 
We 'could not explain it, unless the

To Raise Palma From Seeds
To start palm seeds Is an easy mat
ter Place half a dozen seeds in a six
inch pot, covering them so they will be
about two Inches below the surface
They should then be well watered, and
the soil should be kept fairly moist con
tinually until the little seedlings push
their way up The soil should never be
allowed to dry out, nor should' It be
kept soggy ; Another good plan Is to
place all the seeds in a box of moist
sand and examine them every few
days Those that burst and begin to
sprout may be planted In fiat boxes two
or three Inches apart In a good, rich,
sandy soil, or they may be potted If
well started In small pots
It should be borne in mind that the
embryo, or seed, leaves of palms are
usually entirely different In form 'from
the true, or character, leaves which
come later In the embryo leaves the
form is long and narrow, swordllke and
usually with no divisions— Robert 'R

QUEEN VICTORIA DEAD
The most influential sovereign of the world is dead, and
her son, Albert Edward, reigns in her stead as King Edward
VII A long and glorious reign has been brought to a close
by the ruthless hand of death, the longest and most glorious
reign in English history Queen Victoria was a good woman
and wise ruler  Her reign was longer, brighter and better
thatn that of any other sovereign who has occupied the Eng
lish throne George III, her grandfather, reigned a long
time and well, but his reign, athough excellent, does not
compare with hers The Victorian era "has earned and will
have a distinctive niche in history for reforms produced
"The most important measures of the reign have been the
abolition of the corn laws, the introduction of cheap postage,
removal of the political disabilities of the Jews, extension of
the suffrage, development of a system of national' education,
abolition of abuses in the army and in the -navy and a re
vision of the Irish land Jaws" By virtue of an act of
Parliament of 1876, Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress
of India the following year Two years later the Conserva
tives were defeated and Gladstone agaih^became^ the head of
the Ministry In 1885 the Conservatives came into power
and Salisbury was made Premier "but in the same year re
tired before a Liberal victory, and Gladstone resumed the of
fideof first Minister, holding until 1886, during which time
the greater part of his energies were devoted to the Irish
question, but the attempt to push through the home rule bill
defeated him, and Lord Salisbury came again to the first
portfolio, which he held until 1892, when on an appeal to the
country, the Liberals were returned and the Queen recalled"
Mr Gladstone to the head of the Cabinet, where he presided
until early in 1894, when he retired; before Lord Rosebery,
whose administration was very brief, for in 1895 Salisbury
was recalled and formed the Unionist Cabinet, and he still
retains bis high office The chief events in the history of
the English nation during his chiefship of the Ministry are
too fresh in public memory to justify recital in so brief a re
view as this"
"Queen Victoria was the mother of nine children-
Victoria, born 1840; Albert Edward, heir apparent and now
King of Great Britain and Ireland, born 1841; Alice, born
1843, died, 1878; Alfred, born 1844; Helena, born 1846;
Louise, born 1848; Arthur, born 1850; Leopold, born 1853,
and died 1884; Beatrice, born 1857 Princess Victoria, the
eldest child, became the wife of the Crown Prince of Prussia,
Frederick William, and is the mother of the present Emperor
of Germany Albert, Prince of Wales, now King, married
in' 1863 Princess Alexandria of Denmark, and their eldest
son, Albert Victor, born 1864, is now heir apparent to the
' crown of England"
"Princess Alice, who died in 1878, was married in 1862
Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse Prince Alfred, Duke
of Edinburgh, married in 1874 Grand Duchess Maria, sister
of the then Emperor of Russia -Princess Helena was mar
ried in 1866 to Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein
Princess Louise is the wife of Marquis of Lome Prince
Arthur created' Duke of Connaught, in 1879 married Princess
Louise of Prussia   Prince Leopold, created Duke of Albany,
in 1882 married Princess Helen of Waldeck-Pyrmont
Pridcess Beatrice married in 1895 Prince Henry of Batten
? berg" --ie -\* r-*' v->v ->-
The legislative Committee on- Revision of Laws has re
jected the reform proposed by the Code Commission' relative
to the selection of trial jurors by Judges The Joint Legisla
tive Committee on Revision and Reform of Laws holds night
ly sessions and is making steady progress with the work So
far the work has been confined to the Code of Civil Procedure
The matter of selecting jurors will no doubt be debated when
the Code bills come from the Committee, whose verdict is by
nd*means final;! On the^suggestion of Assemblyman Fred L
Stewart, of this county, the Joint Committee adopted a new
requirement regarding jury service There is now no limit
of age for trial jurors, and the Stewart amendment fixes 6q
years as the maximum, thus relieving all persons from ser
vice as jurors who are over that age
w JNO sovereign has ever come to his or her last hours for
whom the civilized worldhas expressed so much of genuine
sympathy as that noted in the case of Victoria of England
Her people will be largely consoled by the reflection that the
Queen of England was honored and respected or beloved in
all parts of the world because of her personal virtues, the
dignity, character and cleanliness she has given to her court,
and the broad and liberal sentiment and the tolerant spirit of
her reign—Record-TJnion

Reference is made elsewhere in this issue* to the Pan-
American Exposition, which is building at Buffalo, NPersonal V, ; at
a cost of $10,000,000* The Pacific coast will  undoubtedly
be well represented at the Exposition, both in the way of ex
hibits and numerically Thousands of well-to-do Californians
have not yet paid the Atlantic coast a visit, and will take, ad
vantage of the low rate of fare to do so The Exposition is
one that should attract people from all parts of the , country;
The Exposition, as its name implies, will pertain to both
North and South America, and a visit to it will  be almost
equal, in point of acquiring reliable information, to extensive
travel in both countries It will be the first great public
event of the twentieth century, and in a number of important
particulars it will surpass all former enterprises of the kind
The United States' building^and the arrangement and; care
of exhibits will cost half a million dollars Iv the Indian
Congress to be held at the Exposition the coming summer,
there will be representatives of forty-two different tribes,i and
life on the Plains in stirring times of the past will,' &] faith
fully reproduced Without question a visit to- the Pan-
American Exposition will well repay the time and money re-
quired to make it
In our county affairs as well as in individual and'corpbr
ate matters there is always the danger of being -'_' penny wise
and pound foolish" That there are many improvements
which will cost money that should be immediately made by
our county authorities there is no doubt, and that in the long
run such expenditure now will result in a large saving to the
taxpayers of the county, there is also no doubt The Ledger
does not purpose to specify with regard to the ueeded'repairs
at this time, buf desires to impress upon our authorities the
importance and necessity of investigating in certain, quarters
and ascertain the extent of the needed repairs and the prob
able cost of making them, before the property bec'oines so
thoroughly a wreck that repairing wili be out of the question
It is a very poor sort of economy that allows valuable prop
erty to decay and become practically useless for thev^ant of a
little timely attention and the expenditure of a few 'dollars
"A stitch in time saves nine," and a dollar's worth qf repair
ing when first needed is worth forty dollars in patching when
it is too late to judiciously repair Personal ,

An Amazon named Mrs Carrie Nation, aided by other
members of the W C T U, recently demolished a
of the leading saloons in Wichita, (Kan,) doing damage
which runs into the thousands The ladies were  arrested
but the chief of police discharged them Mrs Nation then
began a street lecture to an immense crowd said to have num
bered upward of 5000 persons After the' lecture the speaker
repaired to the railway station While in the act of buying
a ticket the Sheriff of the county laid his hand lightly upon
her shoulder and saidPersonal "You are my prisoner;" "The in-
furiated woman turned upon him like a tigress, slapped his
face, pulled his ears and shook him until his teeth rattled
and his collar button flew out She was finally placed in one
of the steel tanks* of "the jail Those who aided in the de
struction of saloon fixtures were also arrested Later all
were bailed out, and Mrs Nation went to an adjoining town
and smashed the leading saloon there into smithereens
Probably within two or three years telephonic com
munications will have been established between Europe and
America President McKinley can then converse with  our
ministers in foreign lands by word of 1 mouth if he chooses to
do so, and our English , cousins can hold "delightful con
verse" with relatives and friends on this side ookf k the" water
Commerce will also derive great benefit in a thousand ways
In the meantime, the problem of the^successful navigation of
the air will have been solved, and while the voice of man will
speed on the wings of lightning to the uttermost parts of the
earth, the body of man will be flying like a bird, hither and
yen, through the atmosphere surrounding our planet But
this is not all; Tesla, the famous, will, perhaps, carry out his
great scheme of communicating with* Mars and present to the
world marvelous manifestations from those who are supposed
to people that planet Verily, the twentieth century will be

* While it is a fact that our mining interests are more or
less hampered, and that litigation has virtually closed^ne' of
our best producers and threatens another, yet there is^inuch
activity among miners and mine owners in Amador county
Extensive prospect work is being done betweenjacksonandthe
Mokelumne river, the Kennedy Mining Company is engaged
in costly development work, the Bellwether is to be developed,
and, if statements already published are to be relied upon; the
Jackson Consolidated, or so-called north extension of the Zeile
mine, is also to be developed without delay There is also
talk of renewed activity in the Plymouth district, and at Vol
cano and Defender mining interests appear very encouraging
The Fremont Consolidated and Bunker Hill properties are
being developed as rapidly as possible, and, all things consid
ered, the mining interests of Amador county are fairly en

tion of pioneer whiskey among ; the
drinking people of Jackson He went

of George A Gordon, County Superin
tendent of Schools of Amador County

which he sold to the miners He was
also interested in mining until he in
company with Ellis Evans went into
the store and hotel business Mr

positions in the State wharfingers office
in Ban Francisco,' but excepting those
times was a resident of Jackson after
his arrival here in 1850 He died at
the hotel In 1894 and left as his surviving
widow j a daughter of Judge A C
Brown, who lives in San Jose Mr
Askey was a joker of' the most pro
nounced type No chance for a good
joke or a good story on his friends ever
escaped him More than one of his
guests iat the hotel - have fished for
salmon In the creek back of the hotel,
while many a story about his friends
told by him and published had Its
origin in his fertile imagination Prob
ably one of the most elaborate stories
he ever told was that with which he
"filled" a newspaper fellow about Hon
A Caminetti's wonderful vineyard and
winery at tne French Gardens, shortly
after that gentleman had taken up
horticulture and viticulture' Ho said
Caminetti had a pipe line from the
ranch to tide water through which he
delivered his wine to the casks in the
deep sea vessels without handling, and
fin its way to tide water the wine was
used as water is used to operate the
mines along the mother lode, the saw
mills, the flour mills and the hay presses
and threshing machines In the valleys
This is but a sample of many other
stories which will be told and retold as
long as the -youngest lad who knew
Armstrong Askey lives

 In 1855 in a suit in the County Court
of Nevada, it was decided that the law
of 1850, under which the town of Jack
son and many other towns was incorpo
rated, was unconstitutional and the
trustees of Jackson met at longer inter
vals until November 19th of that year,
when the last meeting was held The
following year the Supreme Court sus
tained the decision of the County Court
and so far as the future was concerned
Jackson was as if it never had been j in
corporated
The first assosstnent of the town was
completed by Assessor Williams, and
the assessment roll turned over to the
Board of Town Trustees, March 8, 1854
The roll showed the valuation of real
estate to be $85,350; personal property
$43,650; making a total of $129,000
The board levied a tax of one-fourth of
one per cent on the assessed valuation
The second assessment of the town was
made by Assessor Askey and the roll
was turned over to tbe board at its
meeting January 15, 1855  In this the
value of real estate was fixed at $169,

unconstitutional and in consequence

A Bit of State History
' Melick of Pasadena, introduced a bill
in the Assembly Monday appropriating
$1,000 for a monument iti mark proper
ly 'the spot where the treaty of
Cahuenga was made
 Now, Cahuenga proved a stumbling
block not only for the Clerk' who read
the title' of the bill, but'for many of the
members not familiar with the places
and traditions of the sunny southland
In explaining the bill, Melick tells a
pretty bit of State history On
January 8, 1847, at the battle of San
Gabriel, the Americans, under General
Fremont, had routed the Mexicans,
under General Andres Pico, but the
latter rallied his forces, and with 600
cavalrymen came sweeping down - the
San Fernando Valley, and the Ameri
cans sallied forth' from Los Angeles,
expecting another battle But to the
intense astonishment of the Gringoes,
the Mexicans sued for peace, a result to
which the Americans were quite ready
to agree Accordingly, the two armies
were drawn up in line at Cahuenga;
whore now tbe barley grows thick and
high, and under the shadows' of a
picturesque group of live oaks General
Fremont and General Pico agreed upon
and signed a protocol whereby  all
hostilities between the Americans and
the Mexicans ceased throughout Cali
fornia ;•' -'-
Cahuenga is about six miles north-
west of Los Angeles,  and Mrs Jessie
Benton-Fremont was able not long ago
to recognize and point out to -Major
Rust the very group of live oak trees
tinder which the protocol was signed
The well-known ['Landmarks Club" of
Los Angeles and a very strong list of
citizens petitioned Mr Melick to intro
duce the bill, ' which provides for the
acceptance by the State of an acre of
ground, and for the care of the pro
posed monument and of the plot by the
Landmarks Club — Rocord-Unlon

DEATH OF QUEEN VICTORIA
- '  - v •
The World Mourns Demise
of England's Ruler
SURROUNDED BT ROYAL FAMILY WHEN ENDGAME
England Deeply Affected by the Call
 ing Away to a Higher Kingdom
  of This Great Woman
; Victoria, Queen ' of England and
Empress of India, died at Osborne
House, Isle of Wight, at 6Personal30 p m Jan
22,1901
Around ber were | gathered almost
every descendant of her line Well
within view of her dying eyes there
hung a portrait of the Prince Consort
It was he who designed the room and
every part of the castle 'In scarcely
audible words, the white-haired Bishop
of Winchester prayed beside her as he
had often prayed with his sovereign,'
for he was her chaplain at Windsor
With bowed' heads the imperious ruler
of the German Empire, and the man
who is now King of England, the wom
an who has succeeded to the title of
Queen, the Princes and Princesses, and
those of loss than royal designation,
listened to the Bishop's ceaseless prayer
Six o'clock passed ' The Bishop con
tinued; his intercession One of the
younger children asked a question in
shrill, childish treble, and was imme
diately silenced The women of this
royal family sobbed faintly, and tbe
men shuffled uneasily
At | exactly half-past 6 Sir James
Reid held up his head, and the people
knew that England had lost her Queen
The Bishop pronounced the benedic
tion l '
' The Queen passed away quite peace
fully She suffered no pain
The body of Queen Victoria was em
balmed, and taken to Windsor 
An, incident, characteristic of the
Queen's solicitude for others occurred
two days before her death when, in one
of the ' intervals of consciousness sho
summoned strength to suggest to her
dressers, who had been acting as nurses,
to take the opportunity of getting some
fresh air
The greatest event in the memory of
this generation, the most stupendous
changein existing conditions that could
possibly be imagined, has taken place
quietly, almost gently, upon the anni
versary of the death of Queen Victoria's
father, the Duke of Kent
The end of this career, never equaled,
by any woman In the world's history,
came In a simply furnished room in
Osborne House This most respected
of women, Personal  living or dead, lay in a
great four r posled bed, and made a
shrunken atom whose aged -face and
figure was a cruel mockery of the fair
girl who,' in 1837, began to rule over
England  
The funeral of Queen Victoria will
probably take place at Frogmore,
though ' nothing in regard to this
matter has yet been announced Her
majesty was so closely related to tbe
European courts that the gathering of
royalists at the obsequies will be un
precedented' Personal
! i Tho record of the last days of the
reign of Victoria is not easy to tell
The correspondent of the Associated
Press was the only correspondent ad
mitted to Osborne House, and his in
terview with Sir Arthur John Bigge,
Private Secretary of the late Queen,
was the only official statement that
had been out  '
For several' weeks the Queen had
been failing On Monday week she
summoned Lord Roberts and asked him
some very searching questions regard
ing the war in South Africa On Tues
day she went for a drive, but was vis
ibly affected On Wednesday she suf
fered a paralytic stroke,, accompanied
by intense physical weakness It was
her first illness in all her eighty-one
years, and she would not admit it
Then her condition grew so serious
that, against her wishes, the family
was summoned When they arrived
her reason had practically succumbed
to paralysis and weakness

from there Monday was as follows;
The snowstorm that has been raging
in Trinity county for several days has
ceased, and to-day rain is falling The
thermometer registers 30 degrees
During the snowstorm eighty-five
inches of snow fell, and to-day, in spite
of the rain, it is two and j one-half feet
deep on the level The roids aro still
blockaded, " and the only communica
tion with the outside world is by horse

ent of j the Press Department of the
Pan-American Fxposition, which will
be held in Buffalo, N V, this year,
refers to the preperations j making as
followsPersonal' ;''"•  '  y '-', ' '
"Continued open weather ' has per
mitted a large amount of outdoor work
tojbe accomplished at the Exposition
grounds About fifteen hundred men
are* now employed inlbrlnging I to com
pletion the great enterprise Painting
has been resumed and will ;be carried
forward as weat her permits ' AH the
buildings are to be done in tints, a
variety of brilliant' colors being em^
ployed to bring out strongly to the eye
the delicate plastic relief work"
NOVEL AND INTERESTING
One of the many novel and interest
ing features of tbe 'Pan-American Ex
position at Buffalo next j summer, ', will
be an extensive exhibition of /women's
manufactures The general 3 public
little realize the extent and importance
of this class of industries, It has been
made apparent to the Board of Women
Managers of the Exposition, however,
by the numerous applications from
prospective exhibitors  • •- -Personal
One woman makes rugs and has built
up'' quite an' Industry She 'keeps a
large number of , wives and daughters
of New England farmers busy with her
work Another manufactures' artistic
jewel settings, -another exquisite things
in pottery, another, carved and deco
rative leather goods, etc In fact, the
women's manufactures are so ; many
that it would ' require  much space to
enumerate them all
- ,4 , a big log ,
One of the attractions of the Oregon
exhibits at the Pan-American Exposi
tion will be a log 30 feet long and 13
feet in diameter  This is not the big
gest-log Oregon could supply The
only reason that the great lumber state
does not send a bigger piece' of lumber
is that the railroads could not con
veniently transport it To accommodate
the 30 foot log, with the diameter of 13
feet, in the Forestry Building at the
Exposition, it wilt be necessary ' to put
extra braces under that part of the
floor of the building" -
THIRTY-FIVE • FAMOUS SCULPTORS
Mr Charles Biol of Chicago, has
been 'appointed to have special charge
of the placing of the sculpture about
the grounds of the Exposition This
sculpture is being turned out by the
thirty-five famous sculptors engaged
in the work,' at a rapid rate, and is be
ing shipped to Buffalo from Mr Bitter's
studios, where it is stored until winter
is over, in the various buildings, prin
cipally the Machinery and Transports,
tlon Building As soon as the condition
of the weather will permit, the work of
installing these decorative -features of
the great Exposition at Buffalo will
begin
 r JAPAN AT THE EXPOSITION 
T'Ramdi, N Nakagama, T Bata,
T Furnyaof Tokio,' Japan, were visi
tors at  the Exposition grounds in
Buffalo recently, in connection with the
Japanese Village concession  They re
ported that Japan -was greatly Inter
ested In tbe Pan-American Exposition,
as the Japanese /regard themselves as
the Americans of the Orient, and are
widea wake to all opportunities to uti
lize new inventions and other incidents
of progress on the American continent
The Japanese were delighted with
the appearance of the Exposition
grounds and expressed the belief that
many 'of their countrymen would be
among the attendance at , the  Exposi
tionl • •- '••
CLEOPATRA ON THE MIDWAY
I?he building which is to contain the
great artistic feature, Cleopatra, on the
Pan-American Midway, Is now well
under way It Is to be one of the finest
structures, from an artistic point of
view, on this popular street of the Ex
position at' Buffalo
 Ashley D M Cooper, the wellknown
California artist, and painter of the
famous "Trilby," has been at work for
some time oft the great canvas which is
to show the Egyptian Queen in all the
luxury and majesty' of her royal mag
nificence It will be historically correct
In 'every respect, and the canvas will be
12x10 feet in dimensions' The work
will cost about 820,000 
Mr, Cooper is a great student, of
Indian customs and has achieved fame
as a" painter of Indian subjects He
was with General Custer during the
disastrous campaign in' which that
brave Indian fighter lost bis life
' MEXICO'S EXHIBIT  
(From "Modern Mexico," Jan, 1901)
"Modern Mexico" hopes to • see
Mexico well represented at the Pan-
American Exposition In Buffalo this
year Last year the government was
occupied with the Paris Exposition and
several small exhibitions in the United
States, and was not disposed at that
time toi'plan extensively for Buffalo
The preparations that are being made
at Niagara are,' however, for an exposi
tion of truly international character
It should not be confounded with
numerous annual, local or State Fairs,
with big names Many of <- the South
and' Central American Countries and
Mexico, as the leading Latin-American
Republic, can ill afford to bo poorly
represented in comparison The Unitr
ed States Is today supplying a market
for more than 75 per cent of Mexico's
expprts and furnishing a largo per cent
of the capital that is at present de
veloping her resources, A complete
and representative exhibit at Buffalo
will be viewed by hundreds of thou
sands of Americans and many thou
sands of other nationalities, and the
cost of Imparting such a knowledge of
this country's varied interests will be
returned to the Republic many fold"

"LUCKY" BALDWIN MADE HIS JOCKEY
RIDE SQUARE
The Horseman Vaed an Argument
That Made the Crooked Rider's
Teeth Chatter While Be Got Ot
All the Speed In the Animal
In the lobby of a hotel the other
evening a number of men were discuss
ing sports and sporting men when the
1 eubjoct of nerve and grit came up One
of the party, a well known Californlan,
| who knew "Lucky" Baldwin in the old
days, saidPersonal
"Baldwin was about the hardest man
to be chiseled out of anything he set
his heart on getting that I ever met up
with' ' A whole lot of people tried to
put It on him In business and other sort
of deals, but none of these ever suc
ceeded in catching 'Lucky 1 ' Baldwin
sufficiently asleep to maKe their plans
stick
"Horsemen still talk about a funny
game In which Baldwin figured on one
of tht* Chicago race tracks a number of
years ago Baldwin had brought his
magnificent string of thoroughbreds to
2 Chicago to make an effort to annex the
swell stakes that were then on tap on
the tracks in the windy town, and he
got them home first or iv the money in
many of the biggest events Well, he'
had one of his finest horses entered In
a valuable long distance event, and
Baldwin was particularly anxious to
win this race, not sd much for the
t purse end of it as for the glory of cap
turing the stake i His horse just about
figured to win, too, and Baldwin in
tended to 'go down the line' on th 6 ani
mal's  chances, not only at the track,
but at all of the big poolrooms In the
countryl He stood to clean up consid
erably more than $100,000 on the horse
If the 'brute got under the wire first
Baldwin's regular stable Jockey • was
taken sick on the morning of the race,
and the old man had to hustle around
for another boy to ride his horse in the
 big event From another horseman he
bought for a big round sum the release
of a high grade rider, who was to have
taken the mount on a thoroughbred
that didn't figure to get near the money
In ths stake  race Baldwin gave the
jockey his Instructions as to the way
he wanted the horse ridden, and then,
when tle betting opened, bis commis
sioners dumped Baldwin's money into
the ring in such large quantities that
the horse became an overwhelming fa
vorite '
"A quarter of an hour before the
horses were due to go to the post a
well known bookmaker, to whom Bald
win had often exhibited kindness in
less prosperous days, ran to where the
old man was standing, chewing a
6traw, in his barn
" 'Baldwin' said the Bookie to the
old man 'there's a job to beat you, and
you're going to get beat They wanted
me "to go in with 'em, but you've al
ways been on the level with me, and I
wouldn't stand for It The ring has
bought up your jock, and your horse
Is going to be snatched'
'''Much obliged for telling me that,'
replied the old man 'I'll Just make a
stab to see that the boy doesn't do any
snatching, though'
"Baldwin borrowed another - grin
from one of bis stable hands (In those
days he always carried one of his own
about as long as your arm), and with
his artillery he strolled over the infield
and took up his stand by the fence
at the turn into the stretch He hadn't
mentioned to anybody what he was go
ing to do, and the folks who saw the
old man making for the stretch turn
simply thought that Baldwin wanted
to watch the race from that point of
view He did, for that matter, but he
happened to have another end in view
"Well, the horses got away from the
post In an even bunch, and then Bald
win's horse went out to make the run
ning The jockey's Idea was to race
the horse's head off and then pull him
In the stretch, making it appear as i»
the animal bad tired Baldwin had
instructed ' the jock to play a waiting
game and make his bid toward the fin
ish The horse simply outclassed his
company, however, and he didn't show
any Indications of leg weariness what
ever as he rounded the backstretch on
the rail a couple of lengths in front of
his field Baldwin could see, however,
that the crooked jock was sawing the
horse's head off In his effort to take
him back to the ruck When the horses
were still a hundred i feet from him,
Baldwin let out a yell to attract his
Jockey's attention, and then he flashed
his two guns'in the sunlight and bawl
ed at the jockPersonal
" 'Leggo that horse's head, you mon
key devil, anh go on and win or I'll
shoot you sot full of holes that you
won't hold molasses!'
"The jock gave one look at those two
guns that Baldwin was pointing
straight at him Then he gave Bald
win's horse bis bead, sat down to ride
for all that was in him, and the horse
under him cantered in ten lengths to
the good on the bit As long as 'Lucky'
Baldwin was on the eastern turf after
that no jockey ever tried to yank one
of his horses"— Washington Post

How Niagara -Wears the Rock
All who have been to Niagara know
that the cataract Is divided by Goat Is
land, the larger portion of the fall be
ing on the Canadian side of the river
This part is known as the Horseshoe
fall and was so named because years
ago it was Identical with a horseshoe
in shape A few years ago a V shaped
break occurred toward the New York
side, and since then other changes have
taken place, until today the Horseshoe
fall is more like Its original form, but
t'early shows the effects of the wear
hp of the waters 
Many people fall to see how the falls
wear the rock away* and this is a little
mystery until the exact conditions are
realized The ledge of rock over which
the water of both the American and
Horseshoe falls flow Is of hard lime
stone It is all of CO feet thiolt and
naturalfy very heavy | Underneath this
ledge of limestone there iTre the shales
Df the Niagara locality This soft rock
Is many feet thick The rock of the
Horseshoe fall Is unprotected, and as
the water falls over the precipice and
bolls in the river below it washes away
the soft shale beneath the limestone,
so that the limestone is left in sheflike
term, projecting far out Into the gorge
Observant visitors to the falls have no
Soubt noticed this condition
In the course of time the shale foun
dation of the limestone ledge is exca
vated-to such a point that the unsup
ported ledge breaks away by Its own
weight, and the crest line of the Horse
shoe  fall recedes so much' farther
Then tbe water attacks the newly ex
posed shale, and in time, tbe process
sutlined is repeated This has been go-
Ing on for centuries, and It will con
tinue until the falls of Niagara are no

three sided pyramid, terminating In a
large trefoil The smoke escapes from
this chimney by three round holes on
sncli side of the three sides The build
ing Is almost covered with mottoes and
carvings, three Latin Inscriptions, one
on encb of the three sides, having 33
letters in each Three angles on each
side bear shields Over the door is the
text from the Vulgate, "There are three
that bear record" Inside the house

Some years ago, however, one of the

personal magnetism a man has in him
goes away in the nighttime, leaving
him like a log on his mattress The

Hobion's Choice
How many of us who use or hear tbe
familiar expression, "It was Hobson's
choice," are acquainted with the real
sort of selection that Tobias Hobson
offered his guests? This is the genuine
version of the talePersonal The said_Tobias
Hobson was a Cambridge Innkeeper,
with -JO horses In his stables, some bet
ter, of course, than others When a
traveler came to request a mount, he
was obliged to take the steed that
stood nearest the door, although there
were so many others advertised as for
hire If the traveler objected to that
mount, all he could do was to wait un
til some other traveler had come for
one and so removed this and left its
next door neighbor nearest tbe stable

THE DATE OF THE FLOOD
Bible Facts 'on Which 'the Bishop
Baaed Hla Question
Some people had fun over the re
ported rejection of eight candidates for
the African Methodist ministry hi the
south by the examining bishop because
they could not tell the date of the
flood Nevertheless the bishop who
asked tbe question knew what he was
doing It may not have been a fair
question, but there is a concise answer
to it  In the Bible, and he no doubt
thought that the eight candidates, If
they were well versed In the Old Testa-,
ment, would answer it at once "
The date of the flood was 1,656 years
after the birth of Adam, In the second
month and the seventeenth day' It be-"
gan then and continued for 40 day's
and nights This is how it is figuredPersonal
The third verse of the fifth chapter of
Genesis reads thus, "And Adam lived
130 years and begat a son in his own
likeness, after his image, and called his
name Seth" Then In the sixth verse
it Is told that Seth lived 105 years and
begat Enos - Adam, says -the fourth
wrse lived 800 years after the birth
of Seth, and tbe latter after the birth
of Enos lived 807 years So It goes on'
Enos begat Calnan when he was 90;
Cainan begat Mahalaleel when he was
75;  Mahalaleel  begat Jared when be
was Go; Tared begat Enochs when be
was 102 Methuselah / was born to
Enoch when the I latter was 65, and
when Methuselah was 187 he begat
Lainecb and Lamech's son Noah came
Into the world when the j father was
IS2 This brings us down to the birth
of Noah, which, according to the added
ages of the several patriarchs at the
time their sons were born, occurred
1,050 years after the birth of Adam
In the seventh chapter of Gensis the
eleventh verse reads as followsPersonal "In
the six hundredth year of Noah's life,
in tbe second month, the seventeenth
day of the month, the same day were all
the fountains of the great deep broken
up and  all the windows of heaven
were opened" This was the flood,
and it came to pass In the year 1658
after the birth of Adam— New York

The Averaice Lawsalt
Personal There Is nothing more ridiculous than
the average lawsuit Two men dispute
over a few dollars and go to law Both
are sure to lose 'Their neighbors are
dragged in as witnesses, and tbe costs
amount to 10 or 20 times tbe amount in
dispute Frequently  these ; lawsuits
ruin families and start quarrels that
last for years Some men claim It Is
"principle" that actuates them in these
lawsuits It Is bullbeadedness, pure
and simple It is newly always easy
to "split the difference"
 Another bad feature about these law
suits is that tlie county Is put to con
siderable expense, and men willing to
work are compelled to siton the jury
Settle your disputes without going to
law If the man with whom you are
disputing is uot willing to "split the
difference" he tvill probably accept a
proposition to leave it to three neigh
bors— Atcbison Globe    --'*
Advice From a Batcher
"What the newspapers should do is
to devote less space to describing what
people should wear and more to what
they should eat" remarked the butch
er "Fasbionably'dressed women come
in here every day who don't know lamb
from mutton or a ben from a rooster
No wonder men have dyspepsia! I find
that men know more about tbe quality
of food stuffs than women do Many
of the latter don't even know the few
simple tests that might b^elp them to
distinguish an old fowl from a young
one and about meat they're greener
yet A young woman came in here the
other day and asked for two pounds of
veal cutlets , I showed her the loin I
proposed to chop tbe cutlets from, and
she remarked, 'Yes; that's very nice,
but Isn't it rather thick to fry?"'-
