Women mainly err through ignorance.
They enter the marriage state already
disordered by irregularity of the periods.
The delicate and sensitive organs, pecu-
liarly feminine, are In no condition for
the shock which is consequent .on the '
great change. Drains that are offensive
and debilitating are set up. inflammation
and ulceration with female trouble are
added in time, and when motherhood
comes the strength of body is inadequate,
and the condition of mind unfit, for the
responsibility. The natural result is a
child that is unhealthy and unhappy.
. Happy wifehood, healthy motherhood, j
beautiful children, all follow the use of Dr.
Pierces Favorite Prescription. It stops
the drains, allays inflammation, heals ul-
ceration, cures . female . trouble, soothes
the nerves, and puts the delicate female
organs in a condition of perfect health.
Mrs. Annie Blacker, of 619 Catharine Street,
Syracuse, N. V., writesPersonal " Your medicines have
done wonders for me.- For years my health was
very poor; I had four miscarriages, but since
taking Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery
and ' Favorite Prescription  I have much better
health, and now I have a fine, healthy baby. I
have recommended your medicines to several of
my friends and they have been benefited by
them." ~. » -

• . It, is perhaps well to recall the fact that Mr. Clark and
Mr; Maginnis of Montana, who are now rivals for the vacan
cy in the Senate from that State, one having an appointment
from the acting Governor and one an appointment from the
Governor, and neither having one chance in a hundred to
win, were together in Washington once before as claimants to
a seat in the Senate. Just after Montana became a State what
was known as the "rump" legislature elected Clark and Ma
Personal ginnis to the Senate, and they appeared in Washington to
take their seats, but were never allowed to do so. They are
what might be called by the superstitious senatorial hoodoos.
Last Monday Congressman DeVries of this district in
troduced three bills providing for the construction of the
works designed by the Debris Commission. The first pro
vides for restraining barriers and dams and impounding
works on the Bear for the protection of the Sacramento and
Feather rivers and makes an appropriation of $250,000. The
second provides for works on the north branch of the Cala
veras river and improvement of the San Joaquin river at
Stockton and Mormon channels and carries an appropriation
of $224,366, while the other appropriates $250,000 for works
on the American river. The work is to be done according to
the recommendation of the Debris Coaimission under the Sec
retary of War. '
The Ledger extends to the visiting Native Daughters,
who will assemble here next week, a most cordial and hearty
welcome. May your Grand Parlor session in Jackson be ex
tremely pleasant and profitable, and your entertainment by
the Mother Parlor, Ursula No. 1, all, and if possible more,
than you anticipate. The citizens of Amador county in gen
eral, and Jackson in particular, are duly alive to the honor
your presence here confers upon them. One and all will en
deavor to make your brief sejourn" as agreeable to you as cir
cumstances will permit. Welcome! Thrice welcome! Grand
Parlor N. D. G. W.
Oregon has spoken in no uncertain sound. McKinley,
expansion, prosperity and Republicanism generally has been
endorsed by our sister of the north. Wolverton for Supreme
Judge was elected by a majority of fully io,ooo. Congress
man Tongue is elected in the First and Moody in the Second
District- by handsome figures. The Republicans will have a
.good majority in the Legislature. The Webb-foot State has
set the 1 pace for the party of prosperity, and the race will be
won hands down next November.
Apparently the dissolution of the Chinese empire, so
often predicted by the European statesmen, some of them as
serting that it would occur at the close of the century, is about
to begin. That the six great Powers of the earth expect to
profit thereby, there can be little doubt. The building of the
great Siberian railway, 6000 miles in length, was evidently
the beginning of the end of the Chinese empire. Doubtless
the next few years will be freighted with vastly important
changes-in the Orient. '
In their anxiety to find something against the adminis
tration, the Democrats made an amusing blunder. After
making a sensational outcry over the refusal of the Comp
troller of the Treasury to allow some accounts of the Wash
ington City Post Office, aggregating about $900, for the fiscal
'-"•year 1898, they discovered that those accounts belonged to a
Democratic postmaster, who was a Cleveland holdover. Now
. ; they are saying less about it.
Republicans are preparing to make a winning cam
, ,paign in every Western State. The alleged Republican dis
satisfaction with the administration in some of these States is
merely a Democratic campaign myth and of the sort likely to
. become numerous, but not dangerous, just now/
. Again the Ledger warns all voters of whatever political
persuasion, to register without delay, and understand thor
oughly when they register in which precinct they belong.
Do not wait until the very last moment, fellow voters, -but
attend to your registration at once.

THE A>f ADOIf LEDGERPersonal JACKSON, UALIFOBNIA. FRIDAY, JUNE 8. 1900
FROM JUNEAU
Gold Mining In Personalthe Mountains Around
Juneau, Alaska.
Juntau," Alaska, May 14, 1900.
Dear LedgerPersonal
Juneau is the central point of
southeastern Alaska at present, for
mining or trade. Silver Bow Creek
empties into the channel just north of
the town and from its mouth to its
source, about six miles, has been rich
in placer diggings. Near the head a
successful hydraulic plant is now in
full operation, also three forty and
sixty stamp quartz mills and a number
of prospect holes all showing gold. A
ledge that does not show considerable
gold in the cropping* is not followed.
Douglas Island lies just across the
channel from Juneau. The Tread well
gold mines here are the largest in the
world. The top of the mine is an open
cut about 300 feet across and nearly as
deep and one-fourth of a mile in length.
The ledge is more than 200- feet wide
and of unknown length anPersonall depth.
The excavation is called the "glory
hole" probably because many, a poor
fellow has gone to glory from here as
accidents are quite frequent. The 400
and 500 foot levels are reached by tun
nels.' Railroads run from the stamp
mills to the levels. The trains consist
of six cars having a crew of two men
with engineer and car man. The cars
hold about two and one-half tons each
and a single shift consists of sixty trips.
Mr. Detert's mule at the ZeUa would
look sick and discouraged could it see
the pile of ore this "steam mule"
handles. The Treadwell mines have
been partially developed for more than
a mile and have enough ore in sight to
last a hundred years. There are six
mills in the works but the largest is es
pecially worth mentioning. It has 300
stamps under one roof arranged like an
ordinary mill doubled and lengthened,
150 stamps on each side. The moun
tain is so" steep that the train runs
down hill from the 500 level to tho top
of the mill. The ore runs from $1.50
to $5 per ton. The concentrates are
sent to the smelters at Tacoma. They
were formerly treated here, but as
men were steadily working the tailings
on the beach below the mill, the com
pany concluded it was worth while to
send their ' product to the smelter.
About 800 men are employed here.
Men without families are required to
board at the company boarding houses.
An immense store is another feature of
this great plant. Employees are not
required to patronize this store bin, as
its prices are lower than any in the
vicinity no one kicks except the local
merchants. Besides all thb the com
pany has its own hospital and  grave
yard, and the controling interest of all
is held by the Rothschilds.
Directly across the channel, a little
south of Juneau, are the Nowell mines.
They are simply in the development
stage, the magnitude of which nearly
takes ones breath. At the mouth of
the creek is the landing and warehouse.
Half a mile up the ravine is an electric
plant supplying light and power. Just
above is a forty stamp mill "for de
velopment" which incidentally pays
all expenses. From here a railroad,
similar to the one on Douglas ' island,
runs a mile and a quarter to the foot of
the mountain which is nearly 4000 feet
high and so steep that ladders and
stairs are frequently needed. At the
base of this mountain a tunnel has been
run in and tapped the ledge. Five
hundred feet farther up another tunnel
has done the same thing. Then a
climb of 1000 feet reaches a third tunnel
which proved the ledge to be still rich,
and a fourth tunnel enters the moun
tain 2500 feet above the valley. From
all these tunnels, except the first,
tramways take the ore to the railroad
and bring back supplies. One day,
when full of ambition, I climbed the
mountain and the foreman at the.upper
tunnel invited me to dinner. The
meal consisted of clam chowder, roast
beef, vegetables, tea and coffee, bread
and butter, pie and pudding. It was
like dining in an eagles nest and tho
view of the glories of nature well re
paid the climb. Sumdum Bay, forty
miles distant, seemed within hail and
the wonders of Alaskan scenery ap
peared to best advantage. From the
pinnacle of the mountain, more than
1000 feet higher, I lookod down on the
other side to the hydraulic and quartz
works mentioned in the. first -of the
letter, and wondered what would be de
veloped here In the next five years.
Truly this is a country of immense
possibilities. • Yours as ever,
_J_,-~-~~_ C - HG>

F. B. Joyce of the Defender mine,
passed through Jackson, on route to
San Francisco, Wednesday. From
him. we learned that the prospects
justified a new ten-stamp mill, which
will probably bd built in the near
future. The present - owners have
taken out about $30,000, using an old
five-stamp mill on the ' premises, in
capable of saving anywhere near what
a later improved, mill will save.
CALAVERAS COUNTY-
ProspectPersonal . During the week there
has been quite a stir in town over the
developments in the Masterson mine,
on the McGuirk ranch, below town.
This, mine is under bond to the well
known mining man, Philip Doides
heimer, who has had a small force at
work opening up the property for
about three weeks or a month. The
first of the week a big blast was put in
to shatter some hard rock and when
' the debris was cleared away a rive foot
vein of very rich rock was exposed.
No assays have yet been made, so far
as . we have been able to learn, but
specimens of rock show it to be first
class, heavily charged with sulphurets.
The Big Horn company at San Do
mingo are going ahead with system
and will soon be taking out ore* from
the good chutes. Machinery has re
cently been put in one of the levels so
that sinking can be carried on, the
vein at that point showing most excel
lently and assaying largely in silver as
well as gold, this feature evidencing
the existence of a lasting vein and a
true fissure. \V. B. Tucker, the
superintendent in charge, is carrying
out every detail and the progress of
the work shows wisdom and precision.
It is hoped that the Big Horn will soon
be heard from all over the State as a
great gold producer and the probabili
ties are that it will be. I Personal,'. <
Mitcbler & Co., are pushing work on
the Ozark mine, between this town and
Angels. A new shaft has recently been
sunk and it is thought the channel will
be found at a "more convenient point
for working. Some splendid coarse
gold has already been found and some
splendid clean-ups have been made at
different times.
Messrs. Folsom, Hayden and Walker
began washing on their mine last Tues
day. They have about three months'
work in sight with flattering prospects.
The Mountain Ranch bids fair to be a
good investment. ~ .~Personal, *>
ChroniclePersonal The Melba mine, located
lon Chili Junction, has resumed work.
The sinking and timbering of the two
compartment shaft will be continued
down to the two hundred foot level,
thence a single-compartment shaft will
be sunk. Kark Whit field has charge
pf the wprk, vice Daniel Grant.
The Pporman mine is ' running full
blast under the able superintendency
of Mr. Cain, and the rock is looking
first rate. The vein in the" north level
is eight feet in width between the walls.
Four feet of this is composed of por
phyry, slate, quartz and gouge and
four feet of solid rock. -The vein in
the south level is between five and six
feet in width and the rock is first class.
The walls in the two back levels are
perfect, solid and smooth, and the in
dications are splendid for a big mine.
The south extension of the property,
known as the Full Moon and owned by
Beals and Trainer, is being worked by
Jim Trainer. The shaft is thirty-six
feet deep and a level has been, run
north thirty-six feet. Theledge is all
the way from one to two feet wide and
the ore is looking better as work- ad
vances. Jim expects to strike a bonan
za within a few feet more — at the point
whore the Lawson and Poorman veins
come together.

A $10,000 pocket was taken out this
week at the J. H. Neale's mine, sttu
»ted'o> Bald'Mt.! A. tew weeks ago a
gold seam' was 'struck in the tunnel and
several  hundred ' dollars extracted.
WorkPersonal was continued and an upraise
\vas run on the gold seam. 'T^e vein
vWw«4 «uti IWi the rich.-buiwh- of
yellow metal was encountered. The
property was formerly known as the
Sugarman. The parties interested are
Messrs. J. H. Neale, Herold, Bod Wat
son, and Chas. Smith. In early daysit
yielded some 'very handsome pockets,
Chas. Sell and others taking out $66,
000 at one time, but it was not worked
to any great depth. The tunnel has
been driven in 800 feet. Several small
pockets have been taken out since Jan
uary. The present yield aggregates
over 500 ounces and it is expected that
more of the precious metal will be ex
tracted before many days. '
Woodruff and Ball are said to be get

better known as the Hihapoo, situated
five miles from here. We hope when

A Stocktonian Dies At Plymouth.
I Last Sunday ' evening at about 9
o'clock, the spirit of . Joseph Goyette
took its flight.
'.-' Deceased was known throughout this
.county as an energetic man of consider
able ability, and whose principles were
Vhonor bright. V For twenty years he
had traveled through Amador county,
up to. four years ago, representing a
portrait enlarging firm. About four
years ago he accepted a position from
W. T. F. Whale, as a traveling sales
man, 5 representing that gentleman's
Foreign and Domestic Monuments,
Vault and General Cemetery Work.
About three weeks ago while on one
of his regular trips through this county
the deceased complained of feeling
somewhat ill, and upon his arrival at
Plymouth was taken worse. He be
came unable to travel and his wife was
summoned from her home in Stockton.
After -two . week's, of illness, death
claimed the unfortunate sufferer and
cast a shadow over tho affectionate
wife. -' . 
Mr. Goyette was of French' descent
and aged about 65 years, and was an
Odd Fellow and a Mason. The body
was taken to Stockton, the late home
of the deceased, for interment.
Deceased leaves a widow to grieve
for a faithful and loving husband.

A  General Mix-Up.
A few days ago a - young 'lad was en
gaged in raking hay on the DeWitt
ranch,- a few miles south of town. The
horse attached to the rake balked, and
when urged forward went backward
with a rush -bringing up in a' deep
ravine,' where horse, rake and boy
were mixed-up with a wire fence. I The
lad scrambled - out unhurt and ran
about- half, a mile, for help. Wm.
Fuller, late principal •of the Aetna
school; responded to the call - and has
tened to *he ravine, where, he found
the horse on its* back, its head in the
wire fence and the rake on top of it.
After cutting • the wire \ fence, ; with
great risk on 'account of frequently
getting entangled himself in reach of
the feet of the struggling animal, Mr.
Fuller finally got the beast upon its
feet, whereupon the ungrateful equine
took hold of his right hand with its
mouth and came near crushing every
bone in it. He carried the marks and
a pretty sore hand for several days.

into a twenty -foot hole and as she was
sinking she caught Mr. Phillips and
pulled him • under ! also.  Mr. Phillips'
brother, Jasper, came to the rescue
and catching the girl by her hair had
almost accomplished his heroic deed,
when she grasped him' by the leg and
rendering him helpless, he was forced
to swim out or drown. John McMillan
went to help, but was too late as the
bodies" of the. two unfortunates had
sunk for the last time. The body of
the young man was recovered at about

IMMENSE GATHERING.
The Italian Picnic A Grand Success In
Every Way.
The annual picnic of the Italian Be
nevolent Society was held in Fullen's
Grove, near Sutter Creek, last Sunday.
The forenoon was mainly taken up
by the grand street parade from Sut
ter Creek to the grove, the Jackson
Band furnishing the ' music, and the
literary exercises at the ground, which
consisted of singing, short addresses
by several gifted speakers, and ora
tions by Hon. F. Cavagnaro of San
Francisco and Attorney W. H. Willis
of Jackson. The first named orator
spoke in Italian and was lustily cheered
by all familiar with the language. He
spoke in his usual happy strain and
was listened to with marked attention.
After a spirited selection by the band
W. H. Willis was Introduced and de
livered an interesting and meaty ora
tion, which was received with many
marks of appreciation. Mr. Willis
acquitted - himself in a manner most
gratifying to his friends and to the
committee who selected himPersonal
The afternoon exercises were of un
usual interest, the dance and baseball
game entertaining the crowd alternate
ly, while minor attractions on every
hand added their quoto of pleasure to
the general festivities of the day. -
Nothing of moment occurred during
the day and evening to marr the pleas
ures of the occasion, and a handsome
sum was obtained for benevolent pur
poses. . •    .
• Grand Marshal Joseph Oneto and his
aids, V. Pasquetti and F. Oneto, de
serve great praise for the efficient man
ner in which they performed their ar
duous duties. The Society is proud of
them and many members thereof speak
in high praise of them. Sheriff Greg
ory and Constable Pat Kelly were on
the grounds and rendered service
where needed.
The crowd was larger than usual and
the affair was decidedly a financial suc
cess, j '. •• .  . ' - -
A Good Move.
While in Amador county last week,
John Raggio, the popular stage line
owner of the Mother Lode, interview
ed some of the citizens of lone, Sutter
Creek and Jackson relative to raising
by public subscription a sum sufficient
to sprinkle the road from lone to Jaok
son during the summer months. Mr.
Raggio met with hearty approval in
each locality, and it is to be hoped that
something beneficial - may speedily
come out of this interview.
All agree that the sprinkling ought
to be done as a matter of saving to the
road, say nothing about the added
comfort to man and . beast. Mr.
Raggio agreed to head the list with a
donation of $100, and he feels confident
that with a committee appointed in
each of the three towns the requisite
amount can' be raised Personal with very little
effort. . . ;.
The Ledger believes that if the
road is sprinkled. for one month, -there
will be no trouble to raise the where
withal thereafter the benefit derived
being so great that the people will not
go back to the old stifling condition no
matter what the expense may be. Let
the trial be made, at least for one
month. , . .
The Moonlight Ball.
It is thought by the people of Jack
son and vicinity that the Grand Moon
light Ball which is to be given by Ex
celsior Parlor of the Native Sons, upon
June 15th, will be the greatest affair
that ever took place in the county.
Every precaution has been taken to
make it a success.  A splendid dancing
platform 100 feet square has been
erected especially for the occasion, an
orchestra of fourteen pieces engaged,
and the very finest supper for "a ball
ever laid in this portion of the State
will be served.
Judge R. C. Rust Grand President
of the Native Sons and Mrs. W. J.
Gett who will then be Grand President
of the Native Daughters, will lead the
grand march.'*
Ten floor directors taken from every
town in the county will see that every
body knows everybody else.
Iced drinks and ices will be served.
In fact the committee in charge has
done all that could be thought Qf to
make the function a, success and a
pleasure to all who will be so fortunate
as to attend.
Everybody should attend,, everyone
must attend, for there will never be
such a time again.
