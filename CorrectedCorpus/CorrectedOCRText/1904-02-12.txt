PROFIT


The matter of feed is of
tremendous importance to the
farmer Wrong feeding is
loss Right feeding is profit
The uptodate farmer knows
what to feed his cows to get
the most milk, his pigs to get
the most pork, his hens to
get the most eggs Science
But how about the children ?
Are they fed according to
science, a bone food if bones
are soft and undeeloped, a
flesh and muscle food if they
are thin and weak and a blood
food if there is anemia?
Scott's Emulsion is a mixed
food ; the Cod Lier Oil in it
makes flesh, blood and muscle,
the Lime and Soda make bone
and brain It is the standard
scientific food for delicate
children,

LONON'S GRASSHOPPER
For Nearly Three and a Half Cents
rles a Famous Landmark
The golden grasshopper on tbe towei
of the Royal Exchange has been foi
nearly three and a half centuries a
London landmark as familiar as tbe
cross on St Paul's or the dragon on
Bow church steeple
Sir Thomas Gresham, a royal agent
in three successie reigns, founded the
exchange in the reign of Elizabeth He
erected at his own expense a beautiful
structure in the Flemish style of archi
tecture, with shops on the first floor A
bell tower crowned by a huge grass
hopper stood on one side of tbe chief
entrance The bell in this tower sum
moned the merchants at 12 o'clock noon
and C o'clock eening uring, the great
fire of IGG6 the building was totally de
stroyed The statues of kings and
queens which ornamented the corridors
were precipitated into the enormous cel
lars and with them the tower and
grasshopper
Gresham was loyally loed by the
metropolis, and his generous ' serices
were not forgotten From the moun
tain of debris the grasshopper was res
cued, and it was placed— a lofty ane
of gilt brass— aboe the new dome sup
ported by eight Corinthian columns,
and to this hour it swings to tbe points
of the compass, perpetuating the sign
and crest of the Gresham family The
old clock in this tower had four dials
and chimed four times daily, on Sunday,
the One Hundred and Fourth Psalm;
on Mgnday, "God Sae the King;" on
Tuesday, "Waterloo March;" on Wed
nesday, "There's Nae Luck Aboot the
Hoose;" on Thursday, "See, the Con
quering Hero Comes;" on Friday, "Life
Let Us Cherish," and on Saturday,
"Foot Guards' March" In 183S fire
again deastated the stately building,
beginning soon after 10 at night, and
by next morning the clock tower alone
was standing It is significant that the
last air played by the chimes before
they went crashing through the tower
roof, crushing the entrance arch below,
was "There's Nae Luck Aboot the
Hoose;" then the eight bells ceased
their clanging
Tho grasshopper was unharmed and
to this clay remains, eleen feet of
shimmering metal, looking down from
its perch 108 feet aboe the busy
streets, — Julian King Colford in St

A CHAT WITH A POET
THE STORY OF AN INTERESTING
EVENING WITH LONGFELLOW
How "EiceUlor," the "Wreck of the
llcHperuH" and the "Old Clock on
the Stair" Came to Be Written
"The Ilridge" Win Born of Sorrow
I once wrote to the poet Longfellbw
asking him to gie me some account of
the circumstances under which he
wrote "The Bridge"— "l stood "on the
bridge at midnight" — a poem which an
eminent English critic has called "the
most sympathetic in this language"
I receied in return a cordial note from
the poet "in which be said, "If you wll
come oer and pass au eening • with
me it will gie me pleasure to tell you
the history of the poem and also of any
of my poems tbat may interest you" jj
A few eenings later found me at the
poet's door at his Cambridge home He
was then erging on seenty years, In
thje f ulluess of his experience and the
ripeness of his fame I was shown lu
to a long, halllike room, dimly lighted,
in which were a broad table, antique
furniture and a tall colonial clock The
poet was, there alone He arose to
meet me and formed a striking 'and
'statuesque figure, with his kindly smile
and long white hair Personalmd beard
"And so you would like to know
something about the Inspiration of
some of my poems— what led me to
write them?" he said when we were
seated "Well,' you are ery kind
"I will tell you first how I came to
write the 'Psalm of Life' I was a
young man then I cau recall the
time It was a bright day, and the
trees were blooming, and I felt an Im
pulse to write out my aim and purpose
In the world I wrote it for myself
I did not intend it for publication
Some months afterward I was asked
for a poem by a popular magazine I
recalled my 'Psalm of Life' I copied
it and sent It to the periodical It saw
the light, took wings and flew oer the
world There you may see it written
on a Japanese screen"
He pointed to a high, richly orna
mented screen which stood before a
great fireplace He added an anecdote
which I hae always regarded as a
true picture of his soulPersonal
"When I was In England I was hon
ored by receiing an initation from
the queen As I was leaing the pal
ace yard my carriage was hindered by
the crowd of ehicles There came to
the door of the coach a noble looking
English workingnian
"'Are you Professor Longfellow?' he
said •;• ? ;
"I bowed
" 'May I ask, sir if you wrote the
"Psalm of Life?" '
?'I answered that I did
" 'Would you be willing, sir to take
a workiugman by the band?"
"I extended my band to him He
clasped it, and neer In my life hae I
receied a compliment which gae me
so much satisfaction
"I wrote 'Excelsior,' " he continued,
"after receiing a letter full of lofty
sentiments from Charles Sunnier at
Washington In one of the sentence?
occurred the word 'excelsior' As 1
dropped the letter that word again
paught my eye I turned oer the let
ter and wrote my poom I wrote the
'Wreck of the Hesperus' because, after
reading an account of the loss of a part
of the Gloucester fishing licet in a
autumn storm, I met the words 'Xor
nian's woe' I retired for the nij?lit aft
er reading tho' report 'of the disaster,
but the scene haunted me I arose to
write, and the poem came to me in
whole stanzas
"The clock in the corner of the room"
he went ou, "is not the one to which \
refer in iriy 'Old Clock on the Stair/
That clock stood in the country house
pf my fatherinlaw at Pittsfield among
the Berkshire hills"
The great clock in the room was hen !>
ing the air in the shadows as he spolco
I could seem to hear It sayPersonal
"Toujours— jamais!
Jamais — toujours!"
It was these words by a French au
thor that had suggested to him tli»
solemn refrainPersonal
"Foreer— neer!
Neer— foreer!"
"Excelsior" had been set to popular
music by the Hutcliiusons wbeu the
poet met one eening the minstrel fam
ily after a concert in lioston Music
hall "I hae," be said, '•another poeo
which I will send to you" lie did sn
It was the first copy of the "Old Clock
on the Stair" One of the family set
the words to music
"My poem entitled 'The Bridge,' " he
said In effect, "was written in sorrow,
which made me feel for the loneliness
of others I was a widower at the
time, and I used to sometimes go oer
the bridge to Boston eenings to meet
friends and to return near midnight by
the same way The way was silent
sae here and there a belated footstep
The sea rose and fell among the wood
en piers, and there was a great furnace
on the Brighton hills whose red light
was reflected by the waes It was on
such a late, solitary wa^k tbat the spir
it of the poem came upon me The
bridge has been greatly altered, but
the place of it is the same"— Hezeklnn

JACKSON  ? iU  CAU
CAUSES OF COLS
One of the Moat Common of Them Is
Eatlngr Too Much
The inariable cause of colds comes
i from within, not without No one takes
cold when in a igorous state of health,
with pure blood coursing through the
body, and there is no good reason why
any one in ordinary health should hae
a cold It may come from Insufficient
exercise, breathing of foul air, want of
wholesome food, excess of food, lack of
bathing, etc, but always from some
iolation of the plain laws of health
There can be no more prolific cause
of colds than highly seasoned foods as
well as frequent eating These gie no
time for the digestie organs to rest
and incite an increased flow of the di
gestie secretions Thus larger quanti
ties of nourishment are absorbed than
can be properly utilized, and the result
is an obstruction, commonly called a
"cold," which is simply an effort of the
system to expel the useless material
Properly speaking, it is self poisoning,
due to an incapability of the organism
to regulate and compensate for the dis
turbance
A deficient supply of pure air to the
lungs is not only a stroug predisposing
cause of colds, but a prolific source of
much graer conditions Pure air and
exercise are necessary to prepare the
system /or the assimilation of nutri
ment, for without them there can be no
igorous health The oxygen of the
air we breathe regulates the appetite
as well as the nutriment that Is built
np in the system
The safest and best way to aoid
colds is to sleep in a room with the
windows wide open and to remain out
of doors eery day, no matter what
may be the weather, for at least two
hours, preferably with some kind of
exercise, if no more than walking One
should not sit down to rest while the
feet are wet or the clothing damp A
person may go with the clothing wet
through, to the skin all day if he but
keeps moing Exercise keeps up the
circulation and preents taking cold
The physiologic care of colds is the
preention of the occurrence The per
son who does not carry around an oer
supply of alimentation in his system
and furthermore secures a purified cir
culation by strict, sanitary cleanliness,
thus placing himself In a positie con
dition, is immune to colds A staring
man cannot take cold
A careful diet would exclude the use
of all narcotics and all food that ls not
thoroughly appropriated An oerfed
person is worse off than one who is un
derfed, because the oerfed body is
taxed to dispose of what cannot be ap
propriated and, when not properly dis
posed of, remains only to be an element
of danger— Science pf Health
Folaononn and Harmless Snakes
There is a certain physiological dif
ference between the poisonous and
harmless snakes which exists ery
plainly in their manner of dentition
All snakes are objects of aersion and
dread to mankind, so much so that to
be bitten by a snake has at times been
so fearful to the ictim as to hae pro
duced death although the snake was
harmless Such ls the instinctie dread
with which these reptiles are thought
of that U may be desirable to hae
some easy mode of distinguishing the
one kind from the other This distin
guishing characteristic is afforded by
the teeth In all poisonous snakes
there are only two rows of teeth, the
fang or fangs being arranged either
within the two rows or outside of them
The harmless snakes hae four distinct
rows of teeth, and when the bite shows
this kind of wound and not any single
deeper or larger puncture there need
be no apprehension
Walking For Malaria
Obstinate cases of malaria that hae
withstood the opeai} oyages, mountain
heights and quinine dosing are said to
hae been conquered by systematic and
continued walking What the malarial
pJent wants most to do is to sit in
doors, nurse his aches and pains or to
He down and doze Adocates of the
walking cure maintain that fresh air is
an antidote not only to the malaria it
self, but to the blues, which usually
accompanies it Their adice to the
sufferer is to dress up warmly if the
weather Ja damp or rainy and go out to
walk Wear flannel next to the skin,
stout shoes* and simple hat If it is
warm, dress lightly, but carry a wrap
to throw around the shoulders against
drafts and too rapid cooling off When
one comes to think of it, there are few
maladies on earth that fresh air and
moderate exercise are uqt good for
The Spectroscope
Originally the spectroscope was ap
plied only to chemistry, and in that
limited field proed Itself an inalu
able aid in accurate analysis By hold
ing In a Bunsen flame a platinum wire
moistened by contact with the skin the
presence of a few grains of salt swal
lowed a few minutes preiously can be
detected, with, the spectroscope In
deed, so wonderfully refined is the
work of the spectroscope chemist that
he can discoer in a substance the pres
ence of one threemillionth of a grain
of metal

wood against the face of the drift

The Soldier's Idle Time
Military life is necessarily made rip
largely of loafing You cannot keep a
man continuously at drilling, marching
or any other branch of military train
ing for eight hours a day and fie or
six days a week You hae to inent a
great many other jobs for him, een to
make a pretense of keeping him occu
pied But these jobs are nearly all
"loafing" jobs, and when it is all done
the soldier has a great many more idle
hours on his hands per diem than any
other man in the same rank of life I
do not know whether it is possible to
arrie at any remedy for this, but, if
it is, the direction in which I should
look for the remedy would be to make
eery soldier work at some other trade
for a certain number of hours each
day The number of hours might be
shorter in the summer, when there is
more opportunity for training and mili
tary exercise, and longer in the winter
If this were practicable, no doubt It
would make an enormous difference to
the alue of the soldier as a citizen
when he leaes the ranks — London

Catbirds and Black Snake
A writer in the Scientific American
saysPersonal "I witnessed a pair of catbirds
making a bold defense against a black
snake bent on deouring the contents
of their nests At first the snake was
inclined to disregard the distressed
birds as they fought to drie it away,
but the blows of their wings and bills
became so annoying that the thief had
to seek refuge in flight On reaching
the roots of the tree, from which the
rier had washed the dirt, the snake
started to climb, only to be drien be
neath them and then out to an old
stump, under which the baffled and
beaten reptile took refuge"

A few months ago the son of a rail
way director was through his father's
influence gien a position of some Im
portance on a large railway He was
fresh from Cambridge, and In the or
ders which he from time to time Issued
to the men under him always made use
of the longest, most unusual words
This habit led to some rather expen
sie blunders, and, the matter coming
before the general manager, he wrote
the young ofliclal the following letterPersonal

tations and in articulating your super

"Know Thyself" was an old ' Greek
thought How to take care of one's
own body is not so simple as some think ;
the human mechanism is a wonderful
thing and requires watching
One man who has done more to teach
the American people how to care for their
bodies than almost any other, is r R V
Pierce, of Buffalo, N V, the Author of the
"Common Sense Medical Adiser" He
says Personal It is not the quantity of the food
eaten which produces strength and health
(for some people can keep strong on a ery
meagre diet), but it is how much food is
absorbed and assimilated by the blood and
carried to nourish eery organ of the body
It is, therefore, itally necessary for the
body that the stomach be in a healthy
state If disease of the stomach, or what is
called "stomach trouble," preents proper
nutrition then the heart, lier, lungs, and
kidneys do not get proper food— they are
not fed on rich red blood, and in conse
quence, begin to show signs of distress
Outwardly these signs may be pimples
and eruptions on skin, pale face, sleepless
nights, tired, languid feelings, or, by reason
of the neres not being fed on pure blood,
they become stared, and we receie a
warning in the pain we call neuralgia
Rheumatism, too, is a blood disease After
years of practice and study r Pierce
found that an Alteratie Extract, which he
named "r Pierces Golden Medical is
coery, " made from the extracts of seeral
plants, inariably produced a tonic effect
upon the system It helped the process of
absorption of the healthy elements in the
food and increased the red corpuscles of
the blood, as well as eliminated the poisons

FOR INCORPORATION
The Ledger now urges npon the
people of Jackson the desirability of
incorporating the town as a city of
the sixth class It would be well to
take immediate action in this direc
tion There is no doubt that under
the circumstances now existing, in
corporation will carry The princi
pal reasons that preailed against
the incorporation three years ago,
r  no longer exist At that time it
was the custom, sanctioned by law,
that business men in incorporated
towns were liable to the county li
cense That is the municipal license
was an additional tax upon the busi
ness interests The only county
burdens they were relieed from by
incorporation were the road tax ley
and the road poll tax Instead of
\ paying money for road purposes for
the county, they paid a street tax
for town purposes Since the last
election, howeer, the law has been
Personal changed, and no county license can
be imposed within the town limits
Incorporation now means that the
reenue from, road tax, poll taxes
and licenses, is dierted from the
county treasury to the municipal
treasury, forming the aiain support
of the town goernment Now let us
see how this reenue would pan out
An examination of the records
shows the reenue contributed by
Township No 1 from these arious
sources to be about as followsPersonal
, Assessable property in Jack
son school district $807,
520 at 50c on the $100 now
leied for road purposes  035 00
Road Poll taxes collected
Township 1 1300 00
County licenses Twp 1 3200 00
Total $8535 00
Making all allowances for the fact
that the proposed incorporation
would not include all the territory
of Jackson school district, and also
a liberal deduction for the licenses
collected from business places in
township one that would ! be outside
the proposed town Units, it may be
safely reckoned that $7000 would be
raised for town purposes without in
creasing the burdens of the property
holders one jot With conseratie
management this ought to leae from
$3000 to $000 aailable for perma
neut improement each year — which
is far more than Jackson now gets
from the county goernment system^
Aboe and beyond all, "Jackson iu
corporated would enjoy the priilege
of atteudingto its own affairs, which
is now denied her Let the moe
ment be started at once, so as to
secure a erdict at the polls before
the new license ordinance goes into
effect
REREGISTRATION NECESSARY
It* is well to impress upon the
oters of Amador county that eery
citizen in order to ote at the com
ing presidential election must be re
registered The great register used
at the last general election has been
cancelled by order of the board of
superisors The general law re
quires a new registration of oters
for eery general election— that
means eery two years The re
quirement is no doubt ery  nec
essary in the large centers of popu
lation, but for counties like Amador
where the changes all told will not
amount to more than 300 or 00
names, it is in the nature of a hard
ship Years ago Amador held on
to its old great register from one
election to another until there were
nearly as many dead and absent per
sons on the oting roll as actual
oters This left the door open for
fraud, and the eil was at length
abolished Now, we are drifting to
the other extreme A new register
eery four years would meet all the
demands in fully one half the coun
ties in the state To re register all
the oters at eery election inoles
much time and expense; it entails
hardship upon many citizens, and
has been the cause of seeral to lose
their otes Howeer, such is the
law, and it is well for eery oter of
Amador county to understand that
he muat make a new application to
get on the register this year, other
wise he will be apt to lose his ote
at tho coming presidential election
Epry person haing business at the
county seat should make it a point
to call at the county clerk's office
and make the necessary affidait of
registration on't delay this mat
tor until the rush of the campaign
is fairly on
SUPREME COURT ECISION
Superisors hae no right to Allow Ad
ditional Clerical Force at Public Ex
pense
The supreme court has rendered a
decision in the case of W E Agard
of San iego against EJ Shaffe, as
auditor of San iego county, which
holds as unlawful the acts of boards
of superisors in employing addi>
tional clerical force, at public ex
pense, to assist county recorders in
preparing abstracts of mortgages to
be furnished to county assessors
pursuant to section 3678 of the po
litical code In the case cited aboe
the board of superisors authorized
the county recorder to employ Agard
for the work mentioned aboe, and
allowed his claim of $130 The
auditor, howeer, refused to draw
his warrant on the county treasurer
for the payment of the ' same, aud
Agard resorted to litigation to com
pel the auditor to draw the warrant
The superior court rendered a de
cision ordering the warrant drawn,
but the auditor appealed the case to
the supreme court and that tribunal
has upheld his contentions
 The superisors acted under sec
tion 3678 of the political code, which
empowers them to proide for the
paymeutof such additional clerical
force as may be required to enable
the couuty recorders to <"<>mply with
the proisions of this section
The court, howeer, holds that this
section of the codo is in conflict with
section 5 article  of the constitu
tion, taking adantage of which a
board of superisors could at will'
fix, to some extent, the compensa
tion of the recorder, which power to
fix the compensation of county offi
cers rests, under the constitution,
solely with the legislature— Solauo
Republican
The W E Agard referred to in
the aboe whs formerly a resident of
Jnckson, and married to a young
lady of this town, Miss Clara Kent
They left this county some fifteen
years ago, and hae since made Uieir
home in the southern county The
decision is of much interest to all
counties in the state Without the
express sanction of law, the super
isors hae no authority to eutail
expense for extra help for any of the
county officers at the cost of the
public treasury

The Meadow Lark
The extract gien below from a lettor
written to one of the deputy game com
missioners by Chas A Vogelsang,
chief deputy, will probably throw new
light on tho subject of the meadow lark
It reads as followsPersonal
  It is a popular error that
moadow larks do damage to grain, but
this is disproen by the agricultural
department at Washington, which has
shown by the analysis of 278 stomachs
of moadow larks that little or no grain
is oer found, and tho little percentage
that is shown was found there at a time
when there was no insect life to feed
upon They aro strictly insectiorous
birds, and are a positie benefit to
eery agricultural community Of
course this statement will not be ac
cepted by many worthy people who
are honest enough in their opinions,
still hae not gien the matter sufficient
inestigation They see the bird in
the fields, following tho plough and
going among the grain that is sown,
not realizing that ho is there simply to
pick up the weeil that is found in "the
grain or such insect life that is turned
up in the furrows, and not to feed on
grain If some of these critics would
take the pains to examine tho stomachs
of the birds just when grain is being
sown, they would ery soon see their
orror If you look at the statutos, Sec
tion 637 A, you will find that tho owner
or tenant of any promises where such
bird is found destroying fruit or crops,
has tho right to kill such birds This
proision was incorporated simply to
insuro tho passage of the bill, that a
certain amount of protection could bo
gien to a bird whose singing is a
Teature of eery California landscape,
and whoso mission is simply to do good
and make the country brighter for his
presence  
[Ranchers, who ought to know, say
differently— that tho birds pull up tho
young grain by the roots— whether in
tho search for iusocts or seeds is im
material, tho destructie work counts
just tho same — Ed]

ecision of the Court
On Fobruary 6 Judge Rust rendered
his decision in tho suit of W Scoblo
against T J Seay and F A Orry a
suit brought to quiet the title of plain"
tiff to tho Champion quartz claim in
Plymouth district Seay, as adminis
trator of tho estate of John Ninnis, dis
claimed any interest in the property
efendant Orr, howeer, filed an ans
wer setting forth that plaintiff aban
doned the mine" by failing to perform
labor on the property during the years
1900 and 1901 amounting to $100, as the
law proides That Orr located the
property No 19, 1901 and had done
the necessary work each year thero
aftor Tho case was tried before the
court seeral weeks ago, a number of
witnesses boinar examinod on each side
Tho case hinged on whother the plain
tiff and his grautors had performed
the annual assessment in the year 1900;
if so the claim was not subject to re
location Oti this point the decision
saysPersonal
The testimony gien by plaintiff him
self on this point is in effect that plain
tiff and his son, W H Scoblo, during
tho month of Noember worked 19
days, and during that time cleaned out
the open cut, ran 8 feet of drift, drilled
and blasted, working nine hours a day,
and that tho alue of this work [ was
$55 In January 1900 he sunk three or
four cuts and three or four prospect
holes on tho claim for tho purpose of
exposing the lodge, as parties were de
sirous of bonding his claim In that
year A J Estoy and his son, Paul
Estey, worked there from 10 to 11 days
for plaintiff, and plaintiff paid them
$50, making a total of $105, in addition
to work done in January aboe men
tioned
In the year 1901 plaintiff bonded tho
property to r Thomas Boyson, who
agreed to do tho assessment work for
that year, and who cleaned out the
shaft, 60 to 75 feet deep, retimborod it
from collar to bottom, and ran a cross
cut at (he bottom 12 feet loug, three to
four feet wide and six foot high, which
work was worth $125 This work was
done in oc, 1901
Plaintiff also did work in 1902 drift
ing on tunnel, himself and Rupert
Tim ins doing tho work, plaintiff's work
being alued at $5750, and that of
Tim ins at $5
A J Estoy and his son Paul both
testified corroborating plaintiff as to
tho work in 1900 and the aluation
thereof, and both testified that instead
of being paid in cash the work went to
pay an undertaking bill due Scoble for
the burial of the mother of the witness,
A J Estey, amounting to a balance
of $50 i;r
efendant Orr endeaored in the
crossexamination of theso witnesses to
contradict them by showing that Este
and his son only performed $25 worth
of work that year, and that the bal
ance duo for the funeral was $25 and
not $50, as testified to by Scoblo, Estey
and his son, but a seere crossexami
nation failed to change thoir testimony
The decision concludes, testing
the oidenco by those rulesPersonal That the
burden of proing a forfeiture rested
upon the defendant who claimed it;
and the further rule that forfeiture
cannot bo established except by clear
and conincing proof of tho failure of
the former owner to hae the work
performed and the improements made
to the amount required by law, it seoms
clear that the defendant has failed to
proe this defense by a preponderance
of the eidence For the foregoing
reasoning it follows that plaintiff is en
titled to a decree quieting title against
defendants, and that as to defendant
John Ninnis, deceased, this decree shall
bo without costs

ALMOST A CENTURY
J Van Natter Will Hae Beached the
100Hilestone of Life on the 25th
Instant
Probably for the first time in the his
tory of Amador county one of her citi
zens is about to pass that age which so
few attain in any land— loo years On
the 25th instant, if he suries that
date — and the indications now are that
he will and many more — J Van Natter
will celebrate tho ona hundredth' anni
ersary of his birth, and his deoted
daughters in Jackson, Mesdames Blair
and Richtmyer, are looking forward to
the eent with keen interest and pleas
ure Mrs Richtmyer, with whom tho old
gentleman makes his home, has already
planned for the occasion a family din
ner, at which there will be present only
a part of the immediate family, G M
Blair, wife and daughter While Mr
Van Natter is not a natie of the state
of California, he came across the piains
with his family in 1863 Fie years
later himself and wife returned east to
Wisconsin, where they resided till 1886,
when his life companion was called
across the rier of death, and he re
turned to California, making his home
since with Mrs Richtmyer, who has
deoted her life to making his latter
days as pleasant as the ministering of
loe and deotion could To show the
wonderful itality with which the old
gentleman is still blossed, until just re
cently bo has been at interals a
familiar figure on our streets, going to
and from tbe barber shop For the
past few days, howeer, he has suffered
somewhat with a cold and neuralgia
He is up, though, and around the
bouse, more cheerful and agreeable
than half the younger generation would
be under similar circumstances While
from neuralgia tho sight of one eye has
been lost, and his teeth all gone, for
one of his years bis memory is some
thing remarkable His liing children
include Mesdames Richtmyer and Blair
of Jackson, Mrs H M Mannion of
Oakland, and James C Van Natter of
Wisconsin He was born in Lawille,
Lewis county, New York, Feb 25, 180,
and the Ledger extends to him hearty
congratulations upon the approach of
this wonderful birthday, and wishes
many more may come in his life
THE LICENSE ORINANCE
Editor Amador LedgerPersonal
ear SirPersonal — In'your article "Radical
ism in the Saddle," it seems to me that
you do not gie the four gentlemen on
the board of superisors who oted for
the>now saloon ordinance, the credit
for business carefulness which is their
due Certainly they hae been giing
the interest of tbo county their close
attention for some time They hae
also cuiKsultud with pur district attor
ney, and, pur lpcal member pf tho board
tells me, hae examined the urdiuauces
from seeral other counties to see what
proisions are in use there for tho regu
lation and control of the different in
terests considered in this ordinance If
there is strength in a multitude of
counsel, certainly the board has taken
great care to hae this naw county law
strong in all its parts, and they should
not be treated as though their work
and that of the district attorney was
the result of a sudden impulse
The way to keep our county in the
front rank of counties is to stand by
our lawmakers and county officers in
eery effort they make for adance
ment—een if it is not just what we, as"
indiidual citizens, may think is the
ery best There is a large element of
our pitigens that sop fc'he ey\] ' effects of
the salpbn business sp plainly as to ery
much dedire its immediate and com
plete discontinuance Others think it
a business of ery little harm The
members o f t, no tyjard who supported
this new county law, can not justly be
charged with belonging to either of
these classes Thoy hae done what
they deem to be the best, cpnsidering
all the circumstances, and, though I
am not personally acquainted with any
ono of the four, I feel that they shqulii
not be charged with ('Radicalism"— at
least not in the sense which tbo general
tone of your criticism Implies
There are always some to find fault,
whateer is done And it seems to me
that the more encouragement the
papers in the county gie to those acts
of our superisors which show so plain
ly an effort to do right, the better for
eery interest concerned Why my
dear sir, It has already been said in my
hearing, that these men will not stand
by thoir own ordinance by |he fjpst of
next'Mi^y" What an' insinuation ! o
you suppose our superisors are chil
dren? Certainly in tho face of such
suggestions you and I ought to say to
them, "Go* on gentlemen, and gie
your ideas a fair test, and we will sup
port ypu," 
• Trusting you will gie this word in
behalf of those men as fair a space in
your paper as was gien their non
endorsement, I am,
Yours respectfully,
W C Howard
lone, Cal, Feb 9, 190

allow the abpye ty pass witfaput com

The Oneida eclares a $0,000 ii
dend for January — Other Mother
Lode Properties Progressing
Oneida— While the Oneida is going
along at the steady gait it has pursued
for the past eight or nine years, pro
ducing something like 7200 tons of ore
per month, it has at last joined tbe list
of diidend payers At a meeting of
tho directors held in San tYancisco the
26th ultimo, a diidend of $0,000 was
declared payable on tho Ist instant
Since this is the first diidend paid by
the property since operations were re
sumed in 1895, it speaks well for tho
economic, businesslilc conduct of the
property under its present manage
ment, and the stock holders are to be
congratulated upon the promising out
look for a little interest on their inest
ment The operations at the mine con
tinue with perpetual motion constancy
Tho winze being sunk 00 fet north of
the shaft at tho 2000 leel, for pros
pecting purposes, is now down about
lOOfeet, but as et nothing startling
has deeloped It willbe continued,
howeer, to the 2200 loel As yet tho
new Aldrich pump lias not arried,
but it is being looked for daily The
electric cable to furnish the' motie
power for the pump has already been
put in place, and the pump will be in
stalled in short order when it' arries
When this pump has been I placed the
Oneida will hae become almost a com
plete electric plant
Keystone,— While this gn?at moth
er lode mine continues its excellent
and steady output, tho management is
oerlooking nothing in tho way of im
proements to greater facilitate hand
ling the large product Since our last
isit at the Keystone two new Grifnn
mills hae boon added to the crusher
plant, the I foundations for the new
boilers to be used as air reseroirs are
nearly completod, and tbe pump at the
800 leel, to take the water from the
sump pump and raise it to tho surface,
is now in place and performing its work
nicely In the mine proper now de
elopment continues with satisfactory
results, and although, as a rule, mm
ing companies who hae nothing to
sell do not adertise the alues of their
product, we are informed by A 1
authority that the big bodies of pay
rock in tho Keystone aerage a good
deal better than the usual run along
tho lode The insipid striko which oc
curred there about a month ago, had
no bad effects upqn tho |abqr condi
lious at tho wine, aqd np trpubhi of
any character is looked for or feared
there for sumo time to conio
VVildmanMahoney —t While as
yet ery little is doing at this property
it is only a matter of a little more time
till Manager Ross will hae gotten
matters in shape to again put tho mine
on a basis of steady operation The
great drawback low is mine timbers
At this time of year, owing to "bad
roads and the distance timbers hae to
be hauled, to socure them is problemat
ical indeed, but notwithstanding those
drawbacks Mr Ross is not discouraged,
and expects in a week or so to hae
men driing towards iho Wildman

el MONTE— At the special meet
ing of stockholders of the el Monte
Mining Company held February 8, the
action pf tho directors in executing' a
trust deed pf the' property to tho
O'Neills to secure tbo payment of in
debtedness tp said Q'Noills in the pur
chase of their interests, iii tho cpmnany
was ratified; Gi9 !• Wrjght was
elected superintendent and manager of
the mine, and Jas J Wright secretary
The work in the big tunnel has been
resumed, and is riiaking steady and
satisfactory headway, aeraging about
two feet por day A new and more
powerful drill has been secured, and
exerything is progressing faorably
The tunnel is now in a distance of about
900 feet, leaing 100 feet more to be run
to reach the point where it is expected
to tap the ledge At the present rate
of progress it is belieed thgt {h/is tun
nel enterprise will bo cqiijpleted by
about the first of April
South Eureka— Although noth
ing startling has occurred at this prop
erty since our last isit there, at the
same time there is no jet u[) in tfcpu^uo
tp npw deelopment' Since' this has
been the making of all the great prop
erties not only on the mother lode but
all oor the world, tho public nood not
feel surprised to hoar exceedingly good
things of tho South Eureka at any
time in the near future At present a
drift south from the 2000 leel has beon
completed for a distance of 700 feet In
tho breast of this thero is now a small
shoeing pf pro, but nqt enough lias boon
donb as jet to determine its oxtent
The object of this drift is simply to
prospect this irgin ground to the ond
lines of tbo company's ground, and it
will be pushed ahead for at least 800
feet further At the 2150 leel a sta
tion is now being cut tp, dlift nprth for
a distance of about 000 feet When
this is completed a winze will bo sunk
to the stopes at the 2300 leel for tho
purpose of bettor entilating tho lower
workings and furnishing hotter facili
ties for handling the timbers in the
stopes at tho 2300 leel As yet nothing
definite has been done relatie to tho
now mjlj, but Mr AJnare expects the
matter, to be taken up some time in
March
Central Eureka— At this prop
erty operations continue stoadily both
in mine and mill, there being at pres
ent about 70 men pmpluyed" Just re
cently tho management decided to open
up 100 feet of additional stoping ground,
consequently a contract was let for
sinking the shaft from tho 2100 to 2200
leel This work was begun fin the
31st of Janiary, and has progressed at
the rate of 5 foet per day If' nothing
unforeseen occurs to delay this sinking,
it is expected to reach tho 2100 leel by
the 20th instant, and probably by tho
Ist of March tho new stopes will be
furnishing ore for the mill

OUR FIRST REPUBLIC
It Wai Not the United States, but the
Louisiana Republic
The first republic in this hemisphere
to succeed in compelling recognition of
Its independence was, of course, the re
public whose proud capital is Washing
ton But there was an earlier one
which died soon after its birth, of
which little or nothing is said in our
American histories
When France, in 176, ceded Louisi
ana to Spain, the subjects of King
Louis XV objected to the transfer
without their consent The local go
ernment submitted the question to the
council, which, under the lead of Nich
olas Chauin de Lafreniere, rose in re
olt  Lafreniere called a conention
of the people at New Orleans, while the
new Spanish goernor was on his way
to the colony, and the conention se
lected a delegate to go to Paris to dis
suade the French king from his course
Louis XV, howeer, rebnffed the dele
gate and sent back word that the peo
ple must recognize the authority of
Spain
It was then that the people of Louisi
ana resoled on a radical course On
the night of Oct 28, 17(58, the rebels
took possession of the French forts and
the gates of the town in the name of
the republic of Louisiana The old
French goernor offered no resistance,
while the new Spanish goernor took
refuge on a ship and sailed for Haana
On Oct 2, 1708, the council at New
Orleans adopted a formal declaration
of independence, officially named it
self the republic of Louisiana, elected
Lefrenlere "protector" and prepared a
written constitution This interesting
goernment lasted from October, 17G8,
to July, 17C9, when a Spanish squadron
of twentyfour essels, with an army of
2,000 men, arried at New Orleans
The new republican state was destroy
ed and fie republican leaders, includ
ing Lafreniere, were put to death
Then all the republic's official papers,
including its declaration of independ
ence and constitution, were burned i
the public square— Springfield Repub

A BOWERY INCIENT
The Inited Client Who Was Called
Before the Feast
The missionary had finished his talk
to the crowd of derelicts In a Bowery
mission and went around the room to
shake them by the band There was
one man sitting on a bench whose face
was so utterly loathsome, that the mis
sionary's gorge rose in his throat, and
he was compelled to pass him by The
man's dulled eye marked the look of
disgust, and in a tone of mingled de
lection and resentment he cried outPersonal
"Say, mister, why don't you shake
hands wid me?"
The young missionary turned, con
science stricken, looked into the sin
ccarred features and grasped the man's
hand
"Really, brother, you must forgie
me," he stammered "I — I couldn't help
It when I saw you — your face But I'll
make amends You must»tnke dinner
with me tomorrow night"
The broken man glanced at his raga
In confusion, blushed like a girl and
gaspedPersonal
"Wot! Mo take dinner wid you! Me
go to your bouse! Me!"
"Yes, I mean it I'll come tomorrow
night and get you"
True to his word, the missionary pre
sented himself at the lodging house
the next eening and inquired for the
man A corpse was lying on the table,
a handkerchief spread oer its face
Tlio clerk jerked his thumb in the di
rection of the body
"That's Wilson," he said "He had
fixed himself up and was waitln' for
you; dropped dead half an hour ago"—

THE EATH CUP
This eadly Fungus Resembles Ser
eral Kdible Slushroomn
Perhaps the most deadly of the poi
sonous fungi of our woods and fields
Is the fairly well known death cup
(Amanita phalloides), particularly dan
gerous from its resemblance to seeral
of the edible mushrooms, though gath
ering fungi for the table should be
undertaken by none sae those thor
oughly acquainted with the different
species, as It is altogether too easy for
the ignorant enthusiast to make an er
ror which may proe fatal to his
friends '
The death cup referred to has n
round cap, white, yellowish or green
ish in color, and the stem has>a swollen
base, surrounded by an enelope, or
eil, of a white filmy substance, which
parts as the stalk extends upward
This stalk is pithy when young, but
hollow at maturity, and the gills of the
cap, which in the meadow mushrooms
are pink or brown, are white in the
deadly ariety, as are also the spores,
which can be plainly seenjlf the cap
is laid, gills downward, onia piece of
colored paper for a few hours The
swollen, or bulbous, base is a distin
guishing characteristic, und no fungus
of that appearance should be, gathered
for cooking One of the liabilities is
that these caps may be broken oil
without due obserance of its base,
which is often coered with earth or
dead grasses, hence not distinguished
from some of the lepiotas, wfliicb, how
eer, are neer surrounded with the
filmy eil of the death cup
The poisonous property of this fungus
is largely the same as thatifound in the
enom of a rattlesnake and also in
cholera and diphtheria, and so far sci
ence is unable to produce any satisfac
tory antidote, atroplne, the stomach
pump and oil purgaties being about
the only resources— Washington Post
A KOREAN CINERELLA
The Quaint Story of Feacb Blosaom,
the Family rudge
In Korea the people tell a Cinderella
story that is much more ancient than
that familiar to western people The
key of the latter story is the slipper,
but not so theirs Peach Blossom, the
Korean Cinderella's name, was tlw
family drudge One day as the moth
er was starting off with the faorite
daughter to a picnic she said to Peach
Blossom, "You must not leae until
yon hae hulled a bagful of rice and
filled the broken crock with water"
While sitting there bemoaning her hard
lot she heard a twittering and a flut
tering of wings Looking up, she saw
a flock of sparrows pecking the hulls
off the rice Before recoering from
her surprise a little imp jumped out
of the fireplace and so skillfully re
paired the crock that but a few min
utes of work was required to fill it
•With water Then she went to the pic
nic and had a royal time
On another occasion the mother said,
"You must stay until you hae pulled
up all the weeds in the field" This
time a cow came out of the forest and
ate up the woods in ten mouthfuls
Peach Blossom followed the cow into
the woods and was kd to where there
was an abundance of ripe, luscious
fruit Gathering a large quantity she
went to the fete nnd was the most wel
come guest Her jealous sistor asked
about it and on being told, determined
she would get some of this fruit for
herself
When the next gain day came the
sister stayed at homo and let Peach
Blossom go The iow came out of the
woods as before, and the sister follow
ed it through tangled brier anil thorn
bushes, with the result that her face
was much scratched nnd her skin deep
beauty all gone— Exchange

THE ESIRE FOR STORIES
From the "Once Upon a Time" Stage
to "That Remind* Me"
Our earliest instinct Is to ask for a
Btory, our latest to tell one unasked
Human life is bounded at either end
by a phrase; "once upon a time" at one
end "that reminds me" at the other
Aboe the first instinct we rise gradu
ally, gradually declining to the second
Not that the narratie sense eer dies
In usPersonal only that in the plenitude of our
powers we are not satisfied with a story
that is nothing more than a story, a
narratie for narration's sake
The mind of a child is all agape for
tacts, for it is empty, and nothing is so
Quickly filling, so easily assimilable, as
n dish of facts Facts of fiction are
preferred by the child to actual fact?
because they satisfy also its strong im
aginatie sense Its moral and intel
lectual senses are still in abeyance e
duce from auy story "a moral" or an
idea, and the child runs away rudely
There lies the difference between us
and it Our , moral and intellectual
senses are flourishing, and by their
strength our imagination is propor
tionately weakened Grimm is not
enough for us Our moral sense cries
aloud for Hans Andersen umas
leaes us cold Our mind needs Balzac
It is not enough for us that once upon
a time there were three princesses or
three musketeers who suffered or did
some (iiicer things We want those
triads to illustrate, to symbolize, to
mean something, to corroborate or up
set some theory that we hae formed,
to quicken our mind and affect our
conduct
Such are the prime needs of our ma
turity Comes Time, mowing away
with his scythe our intellectual and
moral curiosity; nor does he restore
to us our old imagination He crops us
bare of all but experience Things that
hae happened— especially, old egoists
that we are, the things that hae hap
pened to ourseles— are the only things
that rouse us from our lethargy
"Anecdotage" is an ugly phrase "Sec
ond childhood," less harsh, is not less
exactly descriptie For our last state,
the state ' where narratie is absolute
despot, was our first state too— Max

Speed of Blrda
Frequently arguments arise 83 to the
speed with which wild birds fly, and
many men of science hae sought to
determine something about it Natu
rally it is impossible to fix the record
made by such birds as grouse, quail and
snipe when they first arise, but it is
safe to say that they are not going one
half as fast as the luckless gunner
who misses them imagines With the
migratory fowls of known fast flight,
such as ducks and geese, something
more nearly accurate is known The
green winged teal is about the speediest
of them all It docs something like
ninety miles an hour as readily ns a
sparrow dies Into an initing rain
spout The canasback is only a trifle
slower, probably eightyfie miles* being
Its limit, while the black duck, mallard
nnd redhead fall below this, being
timed at about eighty inijes Still this
is plenty fast enough to Insure lots of
misses unless the fellow with the gun
looks down the rib straight nnd pulls
the trigger at the right time
Elephants and Mice
An elephant is usually afraid of any
small animal to which it is unaccus
tomed A dog or cat, and sometimes
een a mouse, will cause him annoy
ance, especially if it runs between the
animal's legs The noise of a mouse
running through the hay will often
cause an elephant to become excited,
but I hae neer known or heard of a
mouse getting'on an elephant's trunk
The terrors of the mouse to a larger
animal is an old story, and many fool
ish superstitions hae arisen from it—

SOLAR MOTION
Tbe Little We Know About Where
the San Is Golntr
Can we find out anything about the
motions of our solar system? The old
astronomer, before the inention of
spectroscoplc methods, could attack
the problem only by a consideration of
certain stellar motions It has been
found that these motions are not alto
gether casual in character, as we
should expect, but there is a tendency
to a grouping of the mottons— an ar
rangement other than • fortuitous It
appears that the indiidual stars form
ing the so called constellations on the
sky are slowly closing up near a cer
tain point of the heaens and as slow
ly opening out near a point diametric
ally opposite This is just what we
should e"xpect if the solar system is ap
proaching the point where the stars
are opening out The phenomenon has
been compared to what we see when a
regiment of soldiers marches toward
us At first there is isible a confused
mass of men only, but as distance di
minishes the ranks open out until each
indiidual becomes at last plainly isi
ble
In tliis way it has been possible to de
termine approximately the position on
the sky of the "apex" of solar motion,
or that point toward which our solar
system is at present traeling It is in
the constellation Hercules We are
obliged to assume that our path is for
the moment a straight line But we
mean that  "moment" which began
When James Bradley commenced the
first star catalogue of modern precision,
about 1750, and which will end long
after present generations of men hae
passed away So mighty is the orbit
in question that many centuries must
come and go as moments before we can
hope to detect the orbit's curature
We are like traelers in the famous
"corkscrew" tunnel of the St Gothard
railway Trains enter on a low leel
and after going around a huge cure
cut in the mountain emerge from the
tunnel again on a higher leel and at a
point almost directly  aboe the eu
trance Passengers while in the darkPersonal
tunnel often amuse themseles by
watching the needle of a pocket com
pass, which makes a complete reolu
tion during the passage But without
the compass they could not know wheth
er the train was moing on a straight
or cured track, and so we passengers
of the solar system, too, cannot know
by obseration whether our great cos
mic track is straight or cured until,
like the compass, the astronomer's in
struments shall tell us the truth—Har
