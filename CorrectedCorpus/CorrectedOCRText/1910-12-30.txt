THE NEW REVENUE SYSTEM
The adopion of he consiuional amendmen separaing
sae and couny axaion is already causing much discussion
as o he effec i will hae in he increase or curailmen of
reenue for couny purposes The nex assessmen of prop
ery will be made in conformiy wih he new order of hings,
and financial solons are busy preparing a bill o be passed
by he incoming legislaure o carry ou he proisions of he
amendmen Under he new mehod cerain classes of prop
ery, such as railroads, elegraph and elephone lines, ielec
ric ligh and power companies, express and banking corpor
aions, will be axed for sae purposes; and he sae goern
men will hae o depend for suppor upon he reenue raised
from hese sources, wihou any general ley upon all ax
able propery, as has hereofore been he case The couny
goernmens will be mainained by a ax leied upon he
balance of he propery lef afer hese sae axed iems are
eliminaed I is eiden ha his radical change in he
reenue laws will bear ery uuequally upon differen coun
ies, according o he alue of saeaxed properies wihin
heir respecie borders Some counies in which he pro
porion of saeclass propery is aboe he aerage will be
adersely affeced, while hose counies where he proporion
is below he aerage will be benefied by he new deparure,
To reduce his disurbance of financial condiions o a mini
mum, a leas unil he new sysem becomes fairly esab
lished, he sae will make good any loss susained by a
couny for a cerain period — fie years we undersand How
he sae will be reimbursed for his liberaliy dees no ap
pear, as here is no proision ha he counies financially
helped by he change shall diy up heir gains for a co 're
How is uiador couny likely o be affeced by he new
deal— adersely or oherwise ? — may be asked The ax rae
for sae and couny p'uposes has aeraged in he neighbor
hood of $2 on he $100 for a number of years pas Of his
ley abou onefifh has been represened by he sae ax
I herefore follows ha he couny can sand a reducion of
onefifh in is assessmen roll wihou suffering any loss of
reenue for local purposes Tha is o say, a ax ley of $2
on he $100 011 an assessmen roll fourfifhs as large as a
presen would leae us pracically unchanged Wih an
assessmen roll of beween fie and six million dollars under
he old regime, a shrinkage of a million dollars in aluaion
would no disurb he couny finances I is difficul o ap
proximaely esae he alue of mador couny propery ha
will be se off for sae assessmen The Pacific Gasjand
Elecric Company's holdings are assessed for abou half a
million dollars The railroad and oher corporaion propery
included in he sae class will easily, all old, bring he sum
oal oer he million dollar mark Bu a porion of his
propery, classed as "inoperaie,' 1 will sill be reained for
couny assessmen How much will be so held will depend
upon legislaie acion defining he scope and meaning of in
operaie propery
I is being heralded hroughou he sae ha a a recen
'meeing of couny assessors an imporan poin was gained
for he counies by haing cerain porions of corporaiou
propery included in he " inoperaie" class, and herefore
assessable by he couny assessors While his acion is
doubless merely adisory o he legislaure in he framing
of a bill on he subjec, sill ndicaes a likely source o f
conen beween he sae and couny auhories oer he new
reenue sysem Wih he diision of he corporae prop
eiy ino "operaie'' and " inoperaie," he firs named as
sessable by he sae and he laer by he couny, he bale
will be on for each side o ge as much as possible of his
propery included in is respecie class To swell he "in
operaie" column will mean more pickings for he couny
assessors and increased reenue or a reduced ax ley for he
couny The capure of recrui propery for he "operaie"
column will mean eiher enhanced income for he sae or a
reducion of axes for he corporaions concerned This dual
auhoriy seems a ulnerable feaure, likely o gie birh o
considerable liigaion before s definiely seled by he
cours, and seeral years will doubless pass ere he new law

Since he growh of cas iron under

Though aeroplane engines represen
a gain in lighness, hey show a loss
in fuel economy Such is he resul of
eas carried ou a he Naional Pysi
cul Laboraory in England, where i
has been learned ha he Gnome en

horsepower, uses 089 pounds of fuel
per brake horsepower hour, while a

perhaps no exceeding a pound per

applied o heaing bakers' oens
Superheaed seam has been used in
he old way for baking, bu he em
peraure of 700 deg or 800 deg or
more deelops a pressure ha may
reach 2,000 pounds per square inch,
and as he seampipes passing around
he oen become rused and worn here
is much risk from bursing pipes By
he new plan, he seam is firs
generaed in a small boiler I is hen
passed hrough a number of pipes in
a furnace, and is here superheaed o
1000 deg before enering he pipes of
he oen In he process of baking
only a par of he hea is gien off,
he seam being lef sufficienly ho
for boiling and oher purposes before
i condenses again o waer Seam
superheaed in his way, being safe
and economical, is recommended for a
ariey of uses
Considering he curious fac ha an

Coninued from Pane 1
abou he maer, saed "Well,
John's (meaning elucchi's) face
was all oer blood, and he said hree
or four jumped on him ou here and
was beaing him He ffo up and came
in here, and I Rae him he gun and
old him o go ou and defend himself
Tha Is abou he mm and subsance
of i"
 is no shown by he record of he
preliminary examinaion ha elucchi
and Coffman had any  furher , coner
saion, or ha Coffman was presen or
winessed or had knowledge of he
rouble hereafer ensuing beween
elucchi and Lopez, or performed any
oher ac in he maer, elucchi,
afer receiing he reoler, holding i
behind him, walked ou' of he hoel
and adanced oward Lopez Upon
reaching he sree, according o he
esimony of Lopez, as shown by he
record, he poined he pisol oward
him (Lopez) and a scuffle cok place
beween hem during which elucchi
wan disarmed by Lopez There is in
he record no eidence from any oher
winess ha elucchi was seen o
poin he gun a Lopez
The proposiion arising from he re
cord of he preliminary examinaion
is his Can one who has simply wi
nessed a par of an affray in he
sree, and reurned o his place of
business, and hereafer sees one of
he paricipans (wih whom i may
be inferred ha he is on some erms
of inimacy) appear inside his place
of business wih his face coered
wih blood, complaining ha hree or
four hae jumped on him and were
beaing him, be held o answer as
an accomplice in an assaul hereafer
commied by such paricipan when
he only acion and adice of he one
so winessing is o hand a reoler o
such paricipan and ell him o go
ou and defend himself
Banishing from he mind he resen
men ha arises from he impruden
and censurable ac of arming a man
wih a gun, who has jus been worsed
in an encouner, o ask he foregoing
quesion Is o answer i   '
In he adminisraion of jusice, cer
ain general principles of law mus be
followed, regardless of • he fac
wheher he guily may or may no
go unpunished in a paricular case
(by his I am no assuming ha he
defendan may hae done somehing
no appearing in he eidence aken
down a he preliminary examinaion,)
ha would hae made him? guily of
any crime whaeer, and saing he
principle or rule inoled in his case,
le i be'supposed, for example, ha
mador Ciy had been  desered dur
ing his rouble sae  and exceping
for he presence of elucchi, Coffman
and Lopez ; ha afer handing he re
oler o eluichi wih he adice
and insrucion o go ou and defend
himself, Coffman had beheld elucchi
creep up behind Lopez and adminiser
a faal blow
Now, by he express proision of
secion 1111 of our penal code a con
icion canno by had on he esimony
of an accomplice, wihou oher esi
mony ending o connec he defendan
wih he commisson of he offense
If his defendan can be held, upon
his record aken a he preliminary
examinaion o be an accomplice and
guily of an assaul of any degree
perperaed by elucchi, hen here is
an absolue demonsraion ha had
here been a foul murder commied
by elucchi under circumsances aboe
menioned, no conicion of any crime
whaeer could hae been had agains
him nowihsanding he posiie
eidence of Coffman
The absurdiy of calling Coffman an
accomplice and holding his eidence o
ie insufficien o susain a erdic of
conicion agains elucchn a sup
posed murder commied as aboe il
lusraed is apparen and ye s
bu he naural and logical conclusion
ha follows in an endeaor o charge
Coffman as an accomplice in an assaul
perperaed by elucchi as se forh
in he record of he preliminary ex
aminaion I is a poor rule ha does

The elemenary principle of law as
laid down in Greenleaf on Eidence, a
sandard ex book in almos eery
law school in he land, is hus saed
in olume 3, a page 71 "If he prin
cipal in he; crime oally and sub
sanially depars from his insruc
ions, as if, being solicied o burn ; a
house, he moreoer commis a robbery
while so doing, he sands single, in
he laer crime while so doing, and
he oher is no held responsible for
he robbery as an accomplice"
Tha elucchi oally and subsan
ially depared from his insrucions
"o go ou and defend himself" 'by
commiing an assaul insead, is es
ablished beyond he shadow of , a
doub, The adice ''o ake 'he gun

lawful and innocen in iself; bu sup

and deparing from such insrucions
elucchi had commied an assaul
upon he sree upon Lopez, ye een
hen, under "his elemenary rule of
law, Coffman could no be held as an
accomplice o ne assaul In oher
words, o hold Coffman as an accom
pice, in any assaul commied by e
lucchi, I mus appear ha he; adised
an assaul, or used ' language from
Which a reasonable deducion migh be
drawn from he language iself ha
such adice was so undersood by he
paries, and ha no innocen consruc

he language used
' The rule laid down in Greenleaf on
Eidence has neer % been changed in
his "sae!" In People s Keefer, 65
Cal 233, s said  "The fac ha he

is suggesed wih much plausibiliy
bu much assurance, ha Coffman is

should be held amenable for he ac of

COOKS' SHOPS.
■•-::■ :■ /—■■■ .-;. - ■
They Were the Beginnings of th«
Modern . Restaurant.
In primitive times tbe only places
hi London where. the public could be
entertained wltb " food had been the
cooks' shops. The famous ICast Cheap
was a great thoroughfare, down which
the. stalls of the butchers alternated
with those of the cooks. You chose a
Joint at the flesh market, and you car
ried, it next door to be cooked for
you by a certain hour. If you wished
for ... wine, you must bring that with
you.' for the cooks sold no liquor, al
though they seem to have provided, as
time went on, more and more of the
natural accompaniments of meat, such
as bread, vegetables and, pastry.
.This habit continued until well Into
the 'reign of Elizabeth, and so . long
as such, an inconvenient custom pre
vailed ; there could have been.no real
comfort for any citizen who chose .to
dine ' abroad. He must have had . as
much trouble with porterage and bas
kets aa a country; party i has today nt
a. picnic. But about the time that
Shakespeare came up to London ; a
remarkable change took place In the
customs of the town, and the practice
of . . public hospitality and - entertain
ment i was singularly facilitated. . < ■
• The nature of this change lay in tbe
sudden development of tbe tavern and
the - consequent withdrawal- of. the
cookshop. The worshipful company
of pastelars, as the cooks were called,
ceased to enjoy the. monopoly of pro
viding hot meals.— Edmund Gosse In
Harper's Magazine. . '■'■ •
Railroads Are Never Finished.
In one respect a railroad is unlike
any. other project undertaken by man
—It Is never finished. Like a cucumber
vine, says a writer in Popular Me
chanics, the instant It ceases to grow
It begins to wither. There must be
continuous expansion and enlargement.
Larger cars require more powerful lo
comotives, , and both in turn call for
heavier :. rails, bigger roundhouses,
stronger bridges, longer platforms and
sidings. Increased safety devices, while
the straightening of curves and the
leveling of grades come In for tbeir
share of attention on even the oldest
roads. Little wonder, then, with our
railroads consuming nearly one-half of
all 'our manufactured steel and Iron
and fully one-half of all the lumber
made each year, that they are the. un
failing barometer or the business ac
tivity of the nation.
The Wonders of Science.
It was left for the exhibitor of a
phonograph In the; 'streets of Utrecht,
according to an American traveler, to
put the finishing touch to the wonder
ful Invention. There was the sound of
a military band In full blast, and then
suddenly the tune stopped and "Bait!"
rang hoarsely out upon the air.
"Who's that Interrupting the con
cert?" flippantly inquired the Ameri
can, edging close to the operator.
"That," said the man, surveying him
blandly, "was the voice of Napoleon
Bonaparte giving the order at the bat
tle of Waterloo."
That Wat the, Trouble.
A Wichita man was fussing because
of his aching teeth. "Why don't you
go to a dentist?" asked one of bis
friends. , „■•■
"Ob, 1 haven't got the nerve," was
the reply.
"Never mind that." replied th«
friend. 'The dentist will nnd the nerve
