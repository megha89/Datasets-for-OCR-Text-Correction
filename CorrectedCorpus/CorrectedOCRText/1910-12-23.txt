COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL SITUTION
The conroersy oer he locaion of he couny high school
ough o be seled by compromise To press he issue o &
oe beween Suer Creek and Jackson would be a disasrous
moe, as whicheer way he elecors migh decide, he resul
would be wo high schools — one in Jackson and he oher in
Suer Creek This would be deplorable, no only because
of he feeling ha would be creaed beween he wo owns
primarily concerned, bu also for he reason ha i would en
ail a much heaier ax upon all propery holders in he
couny ouside of he presen lone union high school disric
Tha hose liing a a disance from eiher own should be
subjeced o an increased ax on accoun of a conenion be
ween wo owns for he honor of securing he couny high
school locaion, is he mos deplorable feaure of he whole
business If here is any way o aoid his by muual con
cession, i seems o us ha ha is he proper pah o pursue,
I mus be paen o any imparial mind ha a couny high
if school wihin he own limis of Suer Creek would be of no
benefi o Jackson The four miles beween he wo owns
would be jus as much an obsacle as he foureen miles o
; he high school a lone now is On he oher hand a school
in Jackson would no reliee he siuaion for Suer Creek
and oher owns o he norh To insis upon eiher of hese
sies is no wise Beer hae one wellappoined couuy
high school, by concessions from boh sides, han hae wo
poorly mainained schools as he oucome of jealous rialry
beween he wo owns
\ Why no compromise by agreeing o locae he school a
or near Marell This inoles a halfway concession by
each side Bu i obiaes he expense of a special elecion,
and also insures one good school  insead of wo poor ones
I will commend iself o he axpayers as he economical
course, inoling he lesser burden, and ha is he mos
poen consideraion wih many I is no in order for eiher
side o be siffnecked on his proposiion The geogeher
spirs he one hing needful jus now, and will be welcomed
as he proper soluion of he problem, no maer—which side
akes he iniiaie wih he olie branch
The midway locaion will sir opposiion from boh sides,
and on arious grounds I is neiher one hing nor he
oher some will say ; a few Jacksonies will Lay hey would
raher hae he school locaed in Suer Creek hau any half
way sie, and ome Sueries may express he senimen in
faor of Jackson Bu his spiri will hardly be faored by
he bulk of he axpayers who will be called upon o foo
he bills nd a journey of wo exra miles for all he
prospecie high school sudens is decidedly preferable o a
rip of four miles for one half of he school populaion The
Ledger would like o see he couny high school in Jackson,
no only because s loyal o is own own, bu also because
Jackson is he populous cener ha will undoubedly furnish
he greaer number of high school aendans Bu we can
no shu our eyes o he wellfounded objecions o his plan,
any more han we can be blind o he argumens from he
couny sea sandpoin agains locaion in Suer Creek, The
difficulies of he siuaion are no ye adequaely appreciaed
They will doubless loom up more prominenly as ime wears
on There can be no funds aailable for saring he school
unil he nex ax ley is made, een if a emporary locaion
were seleced I is jus as well o make hase slowly in
his maer mple ime should be gien o weigh all he
pros and cons of he maer before any decisie acion is

There is a disposiion in some quarers o ignore he ad

like points; shooting into a thousand
fantastic forms. Minarets rose above
as if rearing themselves over some an
riunt citadel where some lord of his
manor held his feudal sway. Here
wns Nature in all its granduer and
glory. The Indians that viewed it first
were gone into the shadow at.d depth
of stillness of time. It stood as an
everlasting monument to never be
forgotton. Evolution might sweep
above its head like the hanging colors
of the kaleodoscope changing every
thing and everybody, but this immu
table fragment of nature would topple
only when the earth bursts asunder
through some sweep of nature in its
last fearful action.
• Once more the whistle sounded, we
looked out of the car and the lake was
before us. It was both beautiful and
picturesque. Looking across the lake
from the California side, you see for
miles the sheer bare mountains, and
contrastingto those on this side covered
with evergreens trees and verdure.
Looking southward tne lake is fringed
by young fir and spruce, and deepening
into shadowy coves The sea-gulls
flop their white wings in ecstasy, as
they flit in play above its pellucid
waters. These are aquatic sea fowls.
Whither did they come? They are not
of migratory nature. They were
planted by the everlasting power we
know not of if they were conjunctive
with the lake itself. , The lake ..has
doubtless been the creator of some
volcano of millions of years ago, when
mephitic air swept in confusion and
chaos over this continent with fearful
fury. Old Tahoe, the greybeareded
child has gone to the happy hunting
ground, but the shadow of his Indian
spirit bears the name ' of the lake.
Twenty five years ago the legislature
squabbled, over giving the lake an
official ■ name! The ~ prestige •of Gen.
Bigler was reaching out to grasp - it,
but the Indian , whose, ancestors, trod
untrammelled around it hundreds of
years ago, held it securely in their
grasp for it is known now far and near
and ever to be called, Tahoe, after, the
venerable Indian of almost an extinct
tribe.* it' is gradually growing Into a
great «ummer resort. It is 20^,' miles
wide and 40 miles long. Real estate
is running skyward rapidly. Upon a
bulletin board I saw the announce
ment, "Lots from $1300 up." The
narrowgauge road brought In alone 40
000 this season to visit, not saying
anything about those that came in
autos, wagons etc. The time is not
far away. when the coast line -of. the
lake will be fringed with the finest
residences, and the rich man with his
millions will 101 l in the shades of its
trees and drink from the pure cold
water of the mountain lake.

"Fakes" Death
To Secure Coin.
. Reno, (Nev,.) Dec. 14.— Fielder
Cravitt of (Joldfield originated - the
easiest and most plausible manner in
which to secure funds from angered
parents When ho "faked" death, sent
a bogus telegram to his father in Okla
homa and secured $100 for, the purpose
of burying himself The' wire was
signed by Dr. John Smith, and told of
the death of Gravitt and asked , that
money be sent at once to .prepare the
body for shipping or interment.
The money was sent post haste, col
lected by the supposed dead man, ami
spent so freely that he now is in a
hospital from excessive drinking.
Gravitt came from Caddo, Oklahoma;
several weeks ago, and soon went
through with what money he had when
he arrived. Casting about for means
to make bis parents come to his aid,
he devised the death scene.
A friend heard of the joke, and at
once wired the truth to the bereaved
parents.
