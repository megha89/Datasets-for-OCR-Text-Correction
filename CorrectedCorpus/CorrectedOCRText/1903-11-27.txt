TWO STOCK EXCHANGES
ifferences Between the New York
and Berlin Institutions Personal
If any member of the New York
Stock Exchange who is entirely unac
quainted with German speculation
should isit the Berlin bourse he would
find at eery point the most striking
diergencies from his home experience
He would be surprised to see the
bourse attended by quite 2,000 persous,
including clerks of banks, newspaper
laen and een isitors like himself
Also, he would be Interested in the Im
mense size of tbe hall— 3oo feet long, di
ided by colonnades into three sections,
one of which is assigned to tlie Produce
Exchange On one side of the hall se
eral doors open into a grassy court,
shaded by trees and surrounded by a
pillared lobby, where brokers sit in dull
summer days and float their latest
stock of anecdotes
That shaded court is suggestie of
etcipper differences between the New
York Stock Exchange and the Berlin
institution In New York the number
of members is fixed and is small in pro
portion to the Immense olume of busi
ness done In Berlin there Is a great
horde of small dealers, and the amount
of trading is much less than In New
York Owing to the easy terms of ad
mission, the bourse becomes a mere
place where traders meet to effect their
transactions There is no sale of seats
In fact, no membership fee exists, but
only a small yearly tax is collected,
which aries from time to time as the
expenses of tbe organization require
Contrary to New York practice, mem
bership is largely held by companies
and firms Nearly all the banks of the
city, for example, are members, and
the more important ones keep aboe a
score of their employees on the floor
Thus the indiidual New York broker,
as a rule, counts for astly more than
a member of the bourse New York is
concentrated, is intense Berlin dis
perses its energy, and is comparatiely
dull It knows nothing of those great
days of triumph or disaster that render
the annals of Wall street picturesque
And it lacks our large daring operators
who startle the country with their bold
schemes— William C reherin Cen

A Water Test
It is one of the easiest things in the
world to tell pure water from the im
pure If you want to test the color of
the water just fin a colorless glass bot
tle with tlu* whter and look through It
at some black object, and the distlnc
tieuess with which you can see the
object will gie you an idea as to the
amount of clay or sand there is in the
water Then pour, out onehalf the wa
ter, cork the bottle tightly and spt It
la a warm place for about twentyfour
hours Remoe the cork and smell the
nir in the bottle If there is an olIVu
lye odor, een the slightest, the water
is unfit for domestic uses Well water,
no matter how bright and sparkling, is
nine times out of ten putreseent Then,
as a matter of course, decomposition is
sure to set in in a day or two if you
put the bottle In a warm place

Copyright, 1903, by T 0 Mcdurt
Rufus, or, to gie him his title cou
pled with tbe name bestowed upon him
 by his sponsors in baptism, Cadet Lieu
tenant James Woodward Sims, U S N,
was in loe
That it was an attack of cadet loe
his classmates emphatically denied At
Annapolis the accepted proerb is "ca
det loe is akin to calf loe," and they
could not detect symptoms of the latter
malady In Rufus
The fact that he was in loe was
einced when Reardon, his roommate,
came suddenly upon the young man in
a reerie of which tue luside boards of
bis locker door seemed to be the object
Reardon coughed and otherwise made
bis presence known If Rufus had been
caught in the act of scaling tbe wall he
could not hae exhibited a more guilty
expression For the first time in their
acquaintance Reardon saw tbe big lieu
tenant blush like a schoolgirl His color
rialed the auburn of his bair, from
which he deried his sobriquet
A photograph of a girl bung on the
inner side of the locker door The usual
array of athletes, family portraits or
footlight faorites was absent This
picture alone adorned the space
Reardon looked at the picture for a
minute "Studying glrlology, Rufus?"
he asked to break tbe awkward silence
"Looks like it, doesn't it?" Rufus'
embarrassment was eident
"It needs study, old man A fellow
must study it carefully, and een then
he often 'flunks' when the test comes"
"This species needs it," admitted Ru
fus, looking up at the face In the pho
tograph
"Yes," said Reardon in a slightly in
terrogatie tone He did not want to
seem curious
"She— it's Bess, you know— writes me
that she will be unable to come to the
farewell hop She has a preious en
gagement, she says"
"Perhaps she has," Reardon suggest
ed by way of consolation, although the
idea seemed ludicrous to him A prei
ous engagement when the Annapolis
farewell hop was In question!
"Well, but she couldn't, man— that Is,
we hae talked of It the whole year—
and when I was at home on the last
leae we— well, Reardon, we sort of
fixed things up, you know," confessed
Rufus, the deep red dodging through
his skin again "And she said she
would be down for the hop and to our
graduation I suppose it's her wom
an's prerogatie to change her mind,
but"— Rufus hesitated
"I understand, old man It's a bit
rough on a fellow She may explain
later" Reardon felt awkward in the
role of sympathizer It was such a for
eign element in his relation with Ru
fus
"There's one little thread of possibil
ity in some nonsense which has passed
between us that might explain matters
to me; but, oh, it is such an absurd,
such an utterly impossible, reason, that
I would not suggest it to her"
Rufus was silent Should he put in
to words the; foolish little matter which
had been weighing upon his mind?
Reardon looked nt him expectantly
"You know, Reardon, how we fel
lows always joke and laugh about the
necessity of naal officers marrying
money You realize that on eery oc
casion we gie ent to the time worn
declaration that we must hae a girl
with capital I, like the rest of you,
hae done It, and— well, Bess was qual
ified in that direction, though it neer
occurred to me at the time
"Recently her father met with re
erses — not serious," you understand
but, oh, hang it, don't you see? She
might hae taken all that nonsense se
riously," finished Rufus He did not
look up at Reardon
And Reardon did just the wrong
thing at that moment He laughed It
all seemed so far out of the limits of
possibility
"Forgie me, Rufus," he said, put
ting out his hand, "but I could not help
it Cheer up And, I say, Rufus, don't
you think perhaps oerstudy has affect
ed your head?" he said, significantly In
dicating his head
Rufua smiled in spite of himself and
srasped'his roommate's band
"Perhaps," he said, closing the locker
door and taking up his cap "Going to
Mrs Butler's?"
The latter question was quite unnec
essary, for Mrs Butler was the wife of
Lieutenant Commander Butler of tbr
Naal academy, and her teas were gen
erally considered the last torments of
the first class man, not that (lioy wen
unpleasant, but they were a duty, n
part of their education for the life of 0
naal officer
Personally Rufus considered them
les3 of a duty than  pleasure) for hp
had spent seeral pleasant hours with
the gracious hostess
As they pulled the old fashioned
knocker of the house in Blake row Ru
fus pulled himself together as if to cast
all sentimental thoughts from his mind
If Bess had a "preious en^agemout"
she might keep it
"Mr Sims, how do you do? And Mr,
Reardon?" snid Mrs Cutler, from be
hind the tea table "Perhaps i was jut
looking for you" ; ' Personal  >'ii'
 "We will gie ourseles the benefit
of the doubt, eb, Rufus?" Reardon said,
glancing about the raom Here and
there were little groups of cadets
"Very well Which of you is at liber
ty for the farewell hop?" Mrs Butler
laughed with the consciousness of ha
ing asked a preposterous question
Both cadets causrht the infeetioiw
laugh, but neither sjjolic for a minute—
Reardon because be must say be was
engaged and Rufus because he could
not quite make up his mind to offer bis
serices for the eening
"Strange as it may seem, Mrs But
ler, I am not escorting any one and am
at your senice," Rufus said after a
minute "You hae a guest?"
_"I will hae She writes me today
that she is coming She is not aware
of the fact that tbe hop Is that night,
I beliee, and I was at a loss for some
one to attend to her dance order Mr
Sims, let me gie you another cup of
tea to thank you"
Reardon, looking on, thought he de
tected a twinkle in his hostess' eyes
She was unusually friolous, he
thought; but, then, it was the end of
the term
"You may only thank me by permit
ting me to escort you as a chaperon"
Rufus was nothing if not gallant
But when Rufus was again In' his
quarters he felt less pleased oer the
responsibility he had assumed for the
eening What an effort he would hae
to make to be een ciil to tbe strange
young person
The chaperon had not yet made her
appearance after the introduction Sho
had been summoned to the telephone
or something
Cadet Lieutenant Sims was doing un
military things with his arms and say
ing anything but the platitudes he
would be expected to utter on first ac
quaintance with a pretty young wom
an
"It's only a little joke of mine/ and
Mrs Butler helped me out," Bess was
saying In strangely smothered tones
VI knew what fun it would be to see
you when you camp here for the strange
girl and found me Yes, I'll admit it
was the fact of papa's losing a little
money that suggested It all I could
not resist it Yon had your little joke;
I had mine"
"But yours was cruel, wasn't it— just
a little, dear? You"— Rufus stopped
suddenly, and Bess became interested
In a large painting of the lieutenant
commander
"You seem to be getting acquainted
ery quickly," laughed Mrs Butler in
the doorway "But our cadets hae a
reputation in that direction"
Preaching and Practice
Spellbinder— Yes, my friends, eternal
igilance is the price of liberty Be on

A Slap at Whistler
A young San Franciscan, the owner
of a large and aluable collection of au
tographs, once wrote to James MneNeill
Whistler, politely requesting his signa

the London Royal academy, with which
the famous American painter was at

COURTING IN IRELAN
Loers and Loemaklng In the Land
of the Shamrock
The Jrlsh way of courting in the old
days a'ud In quiet country places een
to the present day was and is ery dif
ferent 'from that style of thing whlcb
makes the subject of many finely paint
ed romances There were no stolen in
teriews, no twilight walks, no thought
of kisses or een hand clasps— in short,
tio loemaking whateer But if they
tere at reaping or haymaking Peter
took hfei place next to Rosie, helped to
bind bpr sheaes when his own were
done and at noonday took his share of
soda cak nnd his draft of milk from
her hands Then in the quiet eening,
when the work was done and the een
ing tuealwas oer, Peter would rise
and look out of the door and say to his
father or sistersPersonal " 'Tis a fine night I
think I'll go for a bit of a stroll" And
the bit of a stroll ineitably ended on
tbe nuyyw path through the whin
buslieVu'p" to the stile, oer which it
was but three Bteps into Alec McCros
san's haggard, and then across to where
the firelight shone welcoming through
an open door
Around the fire the family circle was
widened to make room for him, as a
matter of course Maybe he took a
draw at the pipe, and maybe he didn't
Anyhow he would sit there quiet and
contented for long enough, talking all
the time to McCrossan or the neighbor
men, but with quiet, happy eyes watch
ing Rosie, tbe loed and cbosen one, as
she sat in the flickering light or moed
about the room And there was a gleam
In her eyes and a smile on her lips
which told him he was welcome and
bade him stay long and come again
soon, and in his heart was a firm re
sole, as soon as eer he saw his way
to marrying, that he would hae Rosie
and no other
This, In spite of all that is written In
story books and silly ' romances or
shown on the stage, is the recognized
and seemly Irish way of courting—

The Sun Makes Rooms usty
There is more dust in the places il
luminated by the sun's rays than in
those which we call shady
If you look along a beam of light as
it streams through a window or a chink
in the door, you will see innumerable
dust particles dancing about in the
light You will be told by most per
sons that there is just as much dust In
the nonilluminated parts of the room
as in the more faored spaces, but you
cannot sco the particles because the
rays do not fall directly upon them
You will think that this is eminently
plausible, but It is not the case
The sun falling upon the air creates
irregular currents, and these currents
stir up the dust and collect it In lay
ers along the line of light; hence there
Is more dust where the sun shines than
elsewhere
A curious experience in a museum
gae proof of this It was noticed that
there was always more dust on the
glass cases exposed to the sunbeams
than on those which were neer touch
ed by the rays of the great orb, and
this led to an inquiry, with the aboe
result
It will generally be found that It
takes longer to clean the sunny parts
of a large room than it does to wipe
up the dust particles from the shady
•nooks
An Oerworked Woman
I stopped to get a glass of milk the
other day at a New Jersey farmhouse,
said the commuter, and the female
head of the establishment, who had
six children playing around, was in
clined to repine at her bard luck in
haing so much work to do
"I run this whole farm," she re
marked in a tone which Indicated that
she was ready to resign
"How many acres hae you?" I In
quired
"A hundred and forty"
"Got any stock?"
"Ten head of cattle, two cows, six
hogs and work horses for the place"
"And you run the whole business?"
I asked
"Indeed, I do; eery hide and hair of
it," she sighed
"on't you hire some help?"
"Of course, but 'taint hired help that
takes the load offen one's body" There
was some in that, and I
paused a minute •_
"Haen't you got a husband?" I then
asked sympathetically
"Yes," she said sternly, "but, you see,
I hae to run him too"— New York

Judges on Circuit
It was the genius and foresight of
Henry I that saw the necessity of cre
ating a close connection between the
central king's court and the local
courts up and down the land It was
Norman and wandering, going where
the king went They were Saxon and
stationary; hence, to link them togeth
er, in 112 a special deputation of
judges was for the first time sent on
circuit in the country, of whom it is
recorded that they "hanged so many
lhiees as neer was before, being in
that little while altogether fortyfour
men"
This igorous administration of jus
tice by royal authority gained for Hen
ry the title of "the lion of justice" and
paed the way for the permanent insti
tution in his grandson's reign These
traeling judges were called justices
ineyre—i c, in itinere, on journey
Their head, the justiciar, is still seen in
our title, the lord chief justice
Henry 11 in 1173 fixed these circuits
at six — the home, midland, eastern,
western, northeastern and northern,
which correspond roughly with those
that still exist— London Standard
American Grit
"I'm used to being drowned," writes
a Kansas City merchant, "but It is

price of beef rise because the Missouri

bor, now annexes his holdings to your
own, now oerflows you altogether, is a
good symbol of American fortune Bury

THE PANAMA IMBROGLIO
The isthmian canal at Panama is
a commercial necessity Its con
struction is demanded by the 'senti
ment of the ciilized world It is
equally manifest that the United
States, owing to its paramount in
terests, and its boundless resources,
is the proper power to build it The
effete Colombian goernment, and
the newly organized state of Panama,
lack the push and means to under
take the task estiny ineitably
points to the United States goern
ment as the source through which
this boon to commerce must come
The nation has set the seal of ap
proal upon the project This does
not imply that methods inoling a
departure from timehonored princi
ples, and the sacrifice of national
honor, will be indorsed in the attain
ment of this end Better the canal
remain uncut for another generation
than that it should be undertaken
as the outcome of intrigue and reo
lution, countenanced or fostered by
the United States
The law of selfdefense is applicable
to nations as to indiiduals Forty
years ago the United States go
ernment was engaged in the bloodi
est ciil war of history to maintain
its territorial integrity We pro
tested againstahy recognition of the
belligerent rights of the seceding
states The world looked on, with
out interference, and saw the strug
gle fought to a finish, with the
national domain unimpaired at the
close The lapse of years cannot
change a, principle The fact that
the United States has guaranteed
that traffic across the isthmus of
Panama shall be uninterrupted, can
not be pleaded as an excuse to pre
ent the United States of Columbia
doing today what this goernment
did in 1861— employing its military
forces to coerce a seceding state
The goernment of Columbia cannot,
owing to the mountainous nature of
the country, send troops by land to
recoer its territory, and it is claim
ed that the United States will not
permit any troops to be dispatched
by sea This simply means that the
power of this goernment will be
exercised if necessary to preent
the forcible return of Panama to the
sisterhood of Columbian states No
doubt the South American goern
ment tried to drie a hard bargain
with the United States in demand
iug an outrageous sum for the prii
lege of digging the canal It was in
the nature of a holdup But it
must be admitted that Columbia was
acting within her national rights
It was her priilege to sell or not to
sell, and to fix the price The price
was higher than anticipated, but
this affords no pretext for encourag
ing reolt and disunion The atti
tude of the United States in this
matter — if her attitude is correctly
gauged by current reports — will
hardly meet the approing erdict
of history
SEEKING FOR AN ALLIANCE
The Hearst papers are clamoring
for an aliiauce of the democratic and
labor parties for the presidential
campaign They point to the munic
ipal election in San Francisco as an
example of the folly of independent
action By unitiny the parties it is
argued that they would hae made a
clean sweep The application of this
adice is intended to hae a much
wider range than state and munici
pal affairs It is nothing less than
an intimation for the democracy and
the labor union ote to pool their
issues, and show a united front for
the campaign of 190 Beyond this
it is a boost of \V R Hearst for the
presidential nomination No doubt
Hearst has some strength with that
element of the laboring men who
faor dragging the unions into poli
tics He is weak with the straight
out democrats By ineigling both
parties to join hands, he hopes to se
cure the place of standard bearer,
with a chance to win out Hearst
is putting forth eery effort to
ingratiate himself with both parties
A few days ago he forwarded a
check for $500 to help the street car
strikers in Chicago The gift was
heralded in the newspapers, all for
political effect Such tactics with
the presidency as the ultimate prize
in iew, are nauseating to the
American people generally Hearst
may capture the nomination, but he
will neer win his way to the con
fidence of the oters thereby The
truth is, Hearst has nothing to rec
ommend him but his wealth Wealth
is powerful in many ways, but it has
neer yet proed much of a factorin
placing a man in the white house
emocracy is hard pressed indeed,
if it takes up Hearst on the double
face proposition
ASSESSMENT OF POSSESSORY
RIGHTS
There seems to be considerable
difference of opinion regarding the
collection of taxes leied against
land held under possessory right,
and prior to the issuance of final
proof It has been the cust"m in
this county, and doubtless the same
rule has been followed in other coun
ties, to assess not only the improe
ments but the land itself from the
time of the homestead filing all
through the fie years' period of set
tlement prior 10 the offering of final
proof uring this period the title
is ested in the United States, and
inasmuch as United States and state
and county property is not subject
to taxation, it is claimed by some
that a possessory right cannot be
legally assessed This question has
led to much discussion, and not a
little misunderstanding The law
perhaps is not well settled on the
proposition, and whether the ques
tion has eer been definitely settled
by the courts we do not know We
do know, howeer, that property
holders in this county who hae
come into possession of lands re
cently patented, hae been surprised
to find that taxes of many years
standing, are clamoring for payment
before the title can be cleared We
do not attempt to discuss the legal
phase of this matter But for all
practical purposes, it may be well
to state that when possessory claims
hae been assessed, and the property
has been allowed to be sold for de
linquent taxes, and where a patent
to the land has been subsequently
secured by the party who held the
possessory title, the state authori
ties hold that such taxes become a
lien against the property, and must
be paid Of course, where the
possessory title is not followed by a
patent, and another claimant files
upon the land, the taxes assessed to
the prior, settler cannot be collected
To aoid misunderstanding, and the
consequent piling up of penalties
upon lands held under this kind of a
title, homestead settlers upon go
ernment land will sae trouble by
paying the small taxes assessed
against their holdings during the
fie years probationary period^ That
is the safest and easiest, and in most
cases the most economical course to
adopt

SOCIALISTIC TENENCY
To the fanatical doctrines of the
socialists is attributed much of the
labor troubles that hae affected the
country during the past decade To
understand their tenets is a difficult
matter for an outsider, because they
reject eery accepted theory and
maxim of political ethics and politi
cal economy Without any mis
representation it may be truly sPersonaliid,
that the cornerstone of the system
is the maxim that "might makes
right" in nil matters pertaining to
the distribution of property With
this as its fulcrum and uniersal
suffrage as its leer, the propaganda
proposes to turn the world upside
down It thus appears that force
and power are the substitutes for all
the oldtime ethics of property rights
and that the doctrines which our
forefathers used in taking possession
of the lands of the Indians are adopt
ed by the socialists in their claim
for the public, appropriation of all
priate property The fact that the
organization is so fanatical renders
it all the more dangerous, for there
is too much method in its madness
to excite the laughter and derision
which it justly deseres — Pacific
"Coast Miner
The Royal mine at Hodson has
been closed down because of demands
made upon the owners by the union
miners Is it not about time ' that
the  truth dawned upon the labor
unions that this shutting down of
one enterprise after another must, if
continued, bring about a period of
depression in mining actiity, and
consequent hard times for those de
pendent upon such industry for a
lielihood Three properties hae
been closed in the mother lode reg
ion within the past month, throwing
out of work between 300 and 00
men The tendency for months past
has been to shut dowrn, rather than
to startup The drift therefore is
in the direction of stagnation and
idleness, instead of a healthy ten
dency to open up new aenues for
the employment of labor A re
action must come, otherwise the
working men will be face to face
with serious conditions in the labor
market ere long It is easy to say,
if work cannot be found in one place,
it can in another The field is large,
but where the same influences are
at work aJJ oer the country, and
the same contraction of operations,
this process of reasoning is delusie
Gompers adice to unions to quit
aggressie measures was sound, and
the members will consult their own
interests by giing heed to it

Alleged Fraudulent Mining Transaction
Mrs M E Odell, of 62 Twelth
street, San Francisco, is charged with
defrauding Arthur Lee of Kansas,
George W Kent of Oregon, and George
~H Horn of Nebraska, by false repre
sontation roncurninjj the aluo of some
alleged miuing ground in Amador
county They were induced to inest
in property to the extent of $500, as
followsPersonal Lee $1100; Kent $1200, and
Horn $2200 The socalled mining
ground consists of 120 acres, in the i
ciuity of Lock wood's station; indeed a
portiojioT it was formerly included in
•ttteLockwood homestead, and pur
chased by Mrs CXI oil from the home
stead claimant after Anal proof had
been offered The land was filed on
for placer mining purposes after notice
of final proof had been gien, and suit
was threatened against the homestead
settler It was not considered of any
alue for mining purposes by those who
ought to know, and the controersy
was settled by purchase for a small
sum The tract, consolidated with a
like tract held under the mining laws
constitutes the mining claim, the riches
of which so Sited the imaginations of
the throe men from three different
states as to get them to inest their
all in it It is needless to say the mine
is a myth The tenderfooted trio is
ited the property and tried to uncoer
its hidden treasures; but no matter
how hard they worked, or where they
worked, the gold failed to materialize
The truth finally dawned upon them
that they were the ictims of a gold
brick scheme, and hae commenced
suit in San Francisco in a despairing
effort to get their money back

No effort has been made by the com
pany to resume underground opera

is rock^on hand to keep it going for

will be kept at work will depend upon
circumstances It is said to be ital to
the working of tho Central Eureka" to
keep tho South Eur 1,i drained This
is where the seriousness of the proposi
tion comes in
Tho correct story of how the strike
was brought about is gien about as
follows, and differs from the accounts
heretofore published It seems that
the skip tender is required to send up
water during the lunch hour The
foreman, R Mounter, noticed on the
day of the difficulty, that this was not
done, and upon speaking to the skip
tender about it, receied a reply that
caused him to discbarge him then and
there A few minutes thereafter, on
his return from some other duty, Mr
Mounter found that water was being
sent up, and inquired who was doing it
He found that the skip tender had re
sumed work, notwithstanding his being
notified to get hi lime Thereupon,
he bad to maintain his authority by
insisting upon his quitting This
brought on the discharge of two others
Tho union took up tho matter, and
wanted to know tho reasons, resulting
in all tho men being called out
We understand the Sutter Creek
Union gae the company until Wed
nesday last to 'reinstate these men
The company, we are told, refuses to
comply It stands firm upon the prop
osition of its right to discharge with
out giing reasons therefor It is not
to be assumed that an employe would
be discharged without reasonPersonal still it
is not adisable at all times to state the
reason So the matter stands at present
The kinkin thocable, and the refusal of
the men to be lowered in the compart
ment where this cable was used, were
incidents in the trouble There were
also one or two other grounds of com
plaint by the men, but tho main cause
that led up to the shutdowu was as
aboe stated
The employes' ersion of the inci
dents leading up to the strike is ' some
what different Seeral things, out
side of the discbarge of tho skiptender
are brought in It is said that the re
instatement of the skiptender is not,
and was not, requested, but only the
other two men— who interceded i bis
behalf at the time, and were discharged
by the superintendent It was i be
half of these that the union took up
the matter, claiming that there was no
sufficient reason for their dismissal
Other side matters are also brought in
as grieances It is fearod in some
quarters that the trouble may spread
and inole other mines in this sec
tion This may coma in two ways,
either from a sympath!tic action on
the part of the union employes of the
other mines, or the mine owners
On Wednesday the strike situation
shifted somewhat In the afternoon of
that day, we are reliably (informed, the
president of Sutter Crook Union, W
F M, called on Superintendent Geo
W Moore, at the office, and stated that
the men were ready to return to work
Attached to this information was a
statement to the effect that the com
pany would be expected to deal with
the union hereafter and not directly
with the employes To this proposi
tion the superintendent replied that he
would do nothing of tho kind; that the
three discharged men would not be
taken back in any eent Also that all
the men on strike might consider them
seles discharged If they desirod re
employmont, they must make applica
tion in their capacity as indiiduals and
not otherwise This is how the matter
stood at last reports It is hopod that
tho troublo will bo settled, and the
mine be placed' on a working basis
again
New Safe at Amador Bank
A now fire proof safe has boen in
stalled in the Bank of Amador County
It was brought up from loao Wednes
day It is of the Marin Hall make,
and weighs 900 pounds Tho safe
that has been doing serice in tho bank
sinco its inauguration, is an old ono,
used in the Pacific Bank before its in
troduction hero, and whilo perfectly
good as far as its fire and burglar re
sisting qualities are concerned, its ma
chinery was worn and therefore it was
decided to secure ono of a more upto
date pattern The old safe will be
taken out of the ault, and sent below
in part exchange for the now ono
Another Turn in the Frates Estate
Another complication in the admin
istration of the estate of Frank Frates
has arisen this week in the application
for letters of guardianship of tho per
sons and estates of tho minor heirs by
Laura K Mullen, aunt of the children
This makes three applications now
pending for letters of admiqistration
Besides this the administration of the
estate of Mrs Frates— wife of tho do
ceased—is yet unsettled, and tho alid
ity of deeds issued under a suit to
create a trust in connection with that
administration, has been called in
question by a guarantee company in
San Francisco All in all, the matter
is decidedly mixed,

MIXING NOTES
Zeila— The Zoila moes along at
its oldtime gait The mill is kept at
work steadily to its full capacity, and
eerything about the mine and mill
runs smoothly The mill produces
fully fie tons of sulphurets per day
The capacity of the chlorination works
is a trifle under four tons per day So
that a large surplus of sulphurets has
accummulated — enough to run the
chlorination works for some weeks
without any further crushing of ore
Kennedy — The construction of the
additional stamps to the mill is making
satisfactory headway The building is
being pushed ahead as rapidly as pos
sible, with the iew of getting It coer

No machinery has been placed in posi
tion as yet, but the foundation work is
all completed The new hoist is giing
some trouble A stoppage of three
days was found necessary the latter
part of last week, to* fix some part

HORN— A meeting of this company
has been called for ecember 29, at the
office in San Francisco to consider the
proposition of increasing the capital
stock from $25,500 to $50,000, increas
ing the number of shares at the same
time from 100,000 to 200,000, the par
alue* to remain the same— 2s cents per
share The property is at a standstill
for lack of funds, and this increase of
capital stock is to raise money by the
sale of shares, to enable work in the
tunnel to be resumed, as it is belieed
that another 100 feet at the outside will
carry the tunnel to the ledgo as reeal
ed by the outcroppings

will protect them from danger, while
others pin their faith to a piece of coal,
which they will carry in their pockets
throughout their career and afterward
bequeath it to a confederate
The pickpocket Is equally supersti
tious It Is said be will not rob a per
son who squints, this being accounted
a sign of disaster, and if it happens
that the purse he robs contains foreign
coins It is belieed to augur that he
will trael a good deal In the immedi
ate future, whether in the company of
a couple of officers or not there is noth
ing to show s
Weddings and funerals are pregnant
with meaning for the professional thief
To pick a pocket at a funeral would be
to court immediate disaster, whereas if
a purse stolen at a wedding contains
gold it portends the best of luck for
the thief during the ensuing six months
Some pickpockets hae a faorite
pair of boots that they wear as long as
they can keep them on their feet, and
If they are not arrested while they are
wearing them they cut the boots up
Into little square pieces and gie them
away as "lucky tokens" to their pals
THE EYES
Black or ery dark eyes denote a ca
pacity for extreme ardor in loe
Greenish tints in blue or hazel eyes
are the signs of wisdom and courage
Steel colored eyes usually denote a
cold nature, also deceit and treachery
Russet brown eyes, untinged by yel
low, mean an affectionate and gentle
disposition
ark blue eyes, while Indicating af
fection and purity, do not represent in
tellectuality ' \
Variable gray eyes are highly intel
lectual and Indicatie of an impulsie
and impressionable temperament
Clear light blue eyes, especially If ac
companied by steadfastness of expres
sion, denote cheerfulness, amiability
and constancy
Tawny eyes denote fickleness Eyes
of no particular color, only feeble
shades of gray, and blue, go with lym
phatic dispositions, characterized by
coldness, selfishness and Ilstlessness

IN THE WAKE OF A
SIE COMB
SYLVIA LEE
Copyright, 1003, by T C McCliire
When the girl one loes as one has
neer loed before throws her arms
about one's necfe and says, "And I
think it would be so loely to hae
diamond side combs instead of a soli
taire, if you don't mind, deaf," and
blushes
Well, one buys the side combs with
out a question, and later perhaps one
reflects But then It's too late
It thus befell with Harkness, and
Leda wore the two starry bands so
deftly posed amid the knotted tangles
of her sunny curls that they suggested
a diadem and in nowise led any man
to the conclusion which time honored
custom has drawn from the solitaire
In fact, before the betrothal was a
week old Harkness himself began to
wonder
And when, at a dance at the Lake
side club, young Wrycroft, the ery
famous half back, inited Leda to go
out for a moonlight row around the
pier with him and Leda accepted and
went Harkness not only wondered, but
grit his teeth as well No man who
has spent ten years dancing attend
ance on other men's fiancees and other
men's wies is going to enjoy life
while his own personal fiancee and
future wife is off with a fellow whose
namu lias headed newspaper columns
and whose chest can hardly find space
for all his medals The couple were
gone an hour and seen minutes by a
watch which had come down through
three generations of the Harkness fam
ily, and when they did reappear the
owner of the watch stood at the head
of the wide stair and claimed the
young lady for the next waltz Wry
croft, happily obliious to his crime,
strolled off, and Harkness led the girl
around the wide promenade to a place
which was quiet and retired enough
for priate conersation He was boll
ing within, but nothing" could hae
been more sweetly calm than the way
In which he put his arm about her and
asked with careless placidityPersonal
"id jou row far, dear?"
"I didn't row at all,'' said Leda "He
rowed"
Harkness kissed her with exceeding
gentleness ' "id you land anywhere,
darling— on the Point, for Instance?"
"Nuuo," said Leda 
Harkness passed his finger oer her
pretty hair in silence for a few min
utes, and then he suddenly gae a
sharp exclamationPersonal
"Good God, Leda, you'e lost one of
your combs!"
Leda put both hands to her head and
almost shrieked as she realized the
truth
'Terhaps you forgot to put one in?"
said her loer
, "No; I had them lwth, I'm sure"
She began to cry Harkness scratched
matches, and they both looked all oer
the floor, but not a diamond glittered
in the general gloom of the hour
Very much later in the eening while
Harkness was twostepplng with Mrs
Lancaster a sudden turn showed him
Leda speaking earnestly to Wrycrcft
Wrycroft looked terribly used up, and
Harkness smiled grimly
"Oh, what a smile!" said Mrs Lan
caster "It's both impressie and
frightening You make me afraid of
you, and yet the smile"
Hark ness \ondered if he wasn't a
fool to be contemplating the addition
of another wife to the assemblage
"You look like a cross between Meph
istophelcs and Machiaelli," went on
Mrs Lancaster, who was slender and
neer lost her breath "Which do you
faor?"
"I can't spell either," replied Hark
ness shortly, ne felt inclined to join
the next expedition to the north pole
The dance endured exceedingly late
It was quite 3 "when the last woman
retired, and a half dozen men were
still lounging on the piazzas when the
first gray streaks of dawn appeared
aboe the Point Harkness sprang up
when he perceied them and yawned
igorously
"I'm going to bed," lie declared, "and
I shall not tarry long upon the order
of my sleeping, either"
Young "Wrycroft stood up, too, and
passed his hand oer his forehead
"I don't feel ery fit," he said slowly
"I beliee I'll go for a little row and
maybe take a dip from the Point"
Ho went down the steps as Harkness
entered the huse Later curiosity led
the latter to wander to the window and
look to see if Wrycroft was really car
rying out his purpose
A rowboat lay on the sandy stretch
opposite, and the rosy light of the ris
ing sun illumined a figure which paced
restlessly up and down the rustic paths
skirting the shore
"I shouldn't callthat exactly swim
ming?" said Harkness to himself a lit
tle grimly He pulled down the shade
with a iolent jerk and got Into bed
It was quite noon when he awoke
The day was glorious, and the bosom
of the lake was dotted with sailing
parties He gae the bell two punches
for hot water and twfsted the dressing
case toward the window as a prelimi
nary to shaing The mirror reflected
the Point, and as Harkness started to
tip it he saw a girl disembarking alone
He unhung his field glasses
Yes, it was Leda!
He threw the glasses on the bed and
went on with his toilet
Bery one was at luhcheon when be
went down, and as he stopped by
Leda's chair to remind her that she
was to drie out with him at 3 he

could not help seeing how wretched
she looked Her hair bore no sign of
side comb
When they went out later there
seemed to be a species of shadow mix
ed with the preliminary silence
The man spoke first (and he waited
a good while)
"You haen't found it, hae you?"
"Oh, dear, no"
"on't you think perhaps it t ell out
in the boat?"
"Why, there was nothing in the boat
to loosen it" x
Flarkncss felt the corners of his
mouth suddenly gie way een while
his temper rose \ He looked off to the
right for a long minute and then asked
seerelyPersonal
"Was there anything at the Point to
loosen it?"
Leda's mouth flew open in undis
guised fright
"Who told you we were to  the
Point?"
"I knew it all the time"
She began to cry
"I neer will again, truly"
"How could you behae so?" said the
loer, launching himself suddenly into
the full tide of his righteous wrath
"You put me beyond all patience; go
Ing off like that with Wrycroft when
you know perfectly well that you be
long to some one else, and then actually
letting him"—
Leda seized his arm
"Only once," she protested earnestly,
"only once"
"Once is once too often," said Hark
ness, a great and exceeding bitterness
welling up In his tone "Once is a great,
great many times too often, consider
ing the situation Now, Leda, listen to
me," he continued sternly "Either
promise me that you will neer, neer
again do anything in the slightest de
gree questionable or we'll call it all off,
and you can gie, me back the comb ,
that you still hae" 
"Oh, I'll promise!" said Leda, with a
submissie choke "I'll neer, neer do
so again Truly, truly Upon my word
and honor"*  •  V,
Harkness looked to the right and
left and behind Then he leaned down
and kissed her  
Leda smiled happily, almost  forget
ting the side comb " 
 "She's a dear little girl," said her
loer, and,' taking all the driing appa
ratus into his right hand, he thrust the
left into his breast pocket and drew
forth the missing comb
Leda screamed
"Oh, where did you find it?"
"I didn't find it anywhere," he said
coolly, as he adjusted the reins again
"I took It out of your hair myself last

A' og's Fidelity
 In the upper part of the famous Se
quatchlc alley," in east Tennessee, a
man and his wife settled when the
country was new and wild One of the
first crops that they raised was a con
siderable Aeld of cotton When it was
ready to be picked, they went out to
gether, prepared to make a holiday out
of this pleasant labor Their one baby
was left in a cradle at the edge of the
field, and the faithful old dog was
instructed to watch the tiny sleeper
After a considerable time they looked
toward the cradle to see If all was well
there They were startled by the dis
coery that the little couch had been
turned completely oer The dog was
making queer dies underneath and
yelping as if in anger As they hasten
ed to the place they were horrified to
find the animal's jaws coered with
blood and instantly came to the con
clusion that he had been rending the
child with his teeth ;
The angry father hit the animal a
deathblow with a cudgel and then
hastily turned the cradle right side, up
There was the baby all unharmed, and
there in the bedding was an enormous
rattlesnake, killed by the faithful dog
after a fierce fight in which both com
batants had receied many wounds— •

Guns hae plenty of uses apart from

of a ship is intended solely for an

in desert countries, where water Is
often difficult to collect out of a mere
dampness of sand, a gun barrel, sunk
Into the ground will collect moisture

saed by a timely suck at the muzzle
Minute guns are fired  for • public

This set one of the marines, a sergeant,
thinking, and he hit upon a brilliant
Idea
After ' regaining reluctant consent
from the captain he took all the aaila

ends of a few of them, filled their bores
with sea water and set them end up

WHALES AS THEY IVE
Something About the Habits of the
Ocean Monatcrx
Both whalers and naturalists hae
usually held that when whales "sound"
they descend to great  depths, says
Knowledge One writer on the subject
estimates that the larger members of
the group die fully a thousand yards
In a memoir published In Belgium r
Bacoltza challenges this belief and
states that In his opinion 100 yards is
the maximum depth to which any
Whale can die and that many species
cannot reach anything like that limit
Says the writerPersonal '^_
" Why should whales want to "ga_to
such depths? AH whales sound for the
purpose of obtaining food, and In the
profound darkness of 1,000 yards what
• food could they get? Those species
which feed on animalcules might, per
haps, obtain what they want But how
about the species which feed on fishes
and cuttles? At a depth of 1,000 yards'
they certainly could not use their eyes
to detect nonluminous species, and we
hae no eidence whateer that they
feed on the self luminous deep sea fish
and cuttles, If, indeed, there be any of
the latter On the contrary, the aailable
eidence indicates that they feed on
ordinary light dwelling fishes and cut
tles which lie In much shallower
zones But this is not all It is known
that the effects of a pressure of more
than three atmospheres proe fatal to
human life; and, although we may be
liee that whales can stund treble this
pressure, or nine atmospheres, which
would occur at about ninety j yards'
depth, is it conceiable that could
resist the effect of ten times the latter
pressure, or ninety atmospheres? More
oer, does it seem possible that a whale
whose body is only slightly  heaier
than water at ordinary pressure could
exert the muscular force necessary to
propel that body to a depth of 1,000
yards? • • ;

They Purify the Atmosphere and
Benefit the Hainan System
The cold wae, so much dreaded by
most people, is really a blessing in dis
guise It charges the atmosphere with
fresh oxygen and a  surplus of free
electricity, which produces a most ex
hilarating  and beneficial effect upon
mankind Torpid energies are aroused,
physical igor and resistance increased,
by the adent of a cold wae to sucli
an extent that any Incidental damage
is more than made up for
The American climate has always
been recognized as a strong factor In
causing the aggressieness and enter
prise which hae lifted our people intc
the first rank among nations and made
us commercially supreme The cold
wae, with Its results of increased en
ergy and igor, Is a meteorological phe
nomenon peculiar to this country Tin
chief of the weather bureau at Wash
ington explains the origin of this wae
It appears that with a high pressure
system, rotating with great elocity
large olumes of cold air are drawt
down from aboe the clouds, so thai
the cold wae is  "homemade," beinf
simply a product of motion The sys
tern of motion originates in the north
west but the cold air comes fron
aboe the clouds
The cold wae is not only useful foi
its beneficial effect upon the humai
system, but as a cleansing and purify
ing agency It dissipates the deadly
carbonic acid gas, the product of respi
ration and combustion, and the foul ef
fluia of decaying matter, Increasing
atmospheric circulation generally am
thereby relieing stagnation— Medica
