THE JPNESE QUESTION
The aniJnpanese bills before he California legislaure are
sirring up a lo of discussion, aiid engendering some feeling
on boh sides of he Pacific ocean The bills aim o preen
Japanese from owing laud in his sae, and o prohibi hem
coming here in fuure, a leas as selers The Japanese
goernmen regards his as an affron o ha naion, inas
much as i denies o Japanese righs which oher aliens en
joy For insance, Europeans are allowed o buy and sell
real esae, wheher nauralized ciizens or no why hen, i
is argued, should he lile brown men be made an excepion
No doub here is some force in his argumen Presiden
Rooseel, realizing he seriousness of any hosile legislaion
iio he direcion proposed, has appealed o goernor Gille o

years, and is formidable characer as a compeior in com
merce or war, sill hey belong o a nonassimilaie class,
whose presence here in large, numbers should audjmus een
ually be prohibied a all hazards Presiden Rooseel is in
faor of accomplishing his diplomaically, wihou sirring
up fricion beween he wo counries, and his is undeniably
he beer way o proceed, een if i does require a few more
years o reach he desired goal Goernor Gille will cooper
