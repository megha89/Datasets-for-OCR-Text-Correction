JACKSON, AMAOU COUNTY CAiIiOKNIA, FKIAY NOVEMBER G, 1903
SIR JOHN SOANE'S WHIM
The Practical Joke a Celebrated Man
Flayed on Posterity
(• One of the most famous of postmor
tem jokes was that perpetrated by the
donor of the celebrated Soane museum
of pictures and other aluable objets
dart to England, the late Sir John
Soane, who died in 1837 In his will
Sir John made proision for the open
ing of three sealed cupboards on cer
tain specified dates in the presence of
the trustees In 1806, that is to say
almost thirty years after the death of
the testator, the first of the mysterious
receptacles was with much ceremony
and breaking of seals opened In the
presence of a committee of men, with
the then president of the Itoyal acad
emy, Sir F Grant, at their head In
stead of a priceless treasure or some
eidence that would throw an entirely
new light upon some doubtful Incident
In political history the contents of the
cupboard  proed to be worthless ac
counts, letters and stationery
Twenty years pased by, and the in
terest that had smoldered after the
disappointment of 1860 was again
fanned into flame at the prospect of
breaking the seals of the second cup
board, at which rite there were pres
ent among others r Alfred Water
house, R A, and Sir (then r) B W
Richardson Like the cupboard mention
ed in the well known nursery rhyme, Sir
John's second cabinet proed "bare"
of any sensation, the contents being
chiefly composed of letters relating to
certain long forgotten family quarrels
that had not een tbe merit of being
Interesting If some of those author
ized to be present at the opening of
the third and last receptacle of mys
tery were dubious about the profit that
would accrue by letting the light of day
fall upon the contents thereof after
sixty years' darkness one at least, Sir
B W Richardson, looked forward
with unabated interest to that day in
189G when the last seal would be
broken and the mystery soled, but he,
alas, died just two days before the
ceremony was performed, and the fact
that Sir John had played a practical
joke upon posterity was duly confirm
ed by the presence of a collection of
perfectly worthless letters and papers
MERRY MEALTIMES
The Table No Place For Fault Find
ins Nngglnc and Strife
Has it eer been your lot to slf at a
table with a group of young folks who
ate the meal in silence or, with & few
constrained remarks, looked askance at
the headof the family before entur
ing on any remark? I hae seen such
a sight on more than one occasion
octors hae told us oer and oer
again of the beneficial results arising
from a meal eaten with a contented
frame of mind and with cheerful sur
roundings; but, sad to say, there are
many households where each meal 4s
a constant scene of bickering, nagging
and fault finding
This is not only the case where there
are young children, who 5 require a
reprimand occasionally for careless
ness, but I am speaking of those homes
where the girls and boyn are well Into
their teens Wrong is that parent, ei
ther father or mother, who chooses the
hour when, all are assembled round
the table to mention some half forgot
ten grieance or to find some fault
If any triial thing has been done
wrong or any duty omitted wait until
dinner or tea is oer before you scold,
blame or reprimand Let the food
which God gies us for the purpose of
nourishing and sustaining our bodies
hae the opportunity of accomplishing
that end, which cannot Ito tlio cusn if
eer}' mouthful is swallowed with ei
ther a sarcastic word or an uncompli
mentary remark More indigestion,
nerousness and other derangements
are caused by the too common fault of
uncomfortable mealtimes than many
people would suppose, and it is our
positie duty, which wo should all try
to remember, to make those hours of
the day cheerful and agreeable to the
children and to set them an example
which you would be the first to notice
and approe in others— Scotsman
WHERE OL HATS GO
Clerk Tells of Unique Scheme Fol
MnkiiiK Cigar Money
"Needn't send that old hat home,'
Bald the customer as he placed the new
ly purchased derby on his head "Iff
too shiny around the edges, and il
would just take up room in the closet"
The customer walked out of the store
and the clerk turned to a friend
"That means cigar money for me," Ik
said, "and I smoke good cigars at that
In most stores it wouldn't do me erj
much good, as all the discarded hats
are giu to the driers of the deliery
wagons Hut here the house allows th
clerks to hae the hats, and as result
we make  little extra money About
once  week the bushclmnn cornea
around to the store looking for old huts,
and when I gie him all I hae collect
ed he pays on an aerage of locenti
apiece for them
' 5 "After the bushhnan has made iiis
rounds he takes the hats to a shop on
South street, and there they are taken
apart The silk ribbons and bands and
sweatbands are remoed and the lial
gien a thorough cleaning and new ma
terial and trimmings put on When it
Is all fixed up it is extremely difficult
to tell it from a new hat, and In many
cases it will sell for as high as $2
When you can buy a hat for 15 cents,
clean it for about 5 cents, put 25 cents'
worth of leather nnd ribbon on it and
sell it for a dollar or more, you see
where the profit comes In, don't you?"—

ASKING QUESTIONS
The Art of Interrogation Should e
eoid of Impertinence
"o not ask questions" is the worst
piece of social adice which age can
gie to youth A man who neer asks
<iutlonß is the dullest fellow in the
world' He had better^ ask too many
than too few We can defend ourseles
against curiosity, but no armor aails
agiiinst Indifference We must resign
ourseles to be bored to death
What is the secret of the art of in
terrogation? Putting aside quick sym
pathies, which lie at the root of eery
sodal art, we beliee the most essen
tial quality for those who would excel
In It is directness The art of asking
questions so as to learn, instruct, please,
; an(J influence is not the art of beating
about the bush The questions which
offend and silence are the questions
'which suggest some ulterior motie It
is a found out scheme which makes
men angry  Anything of the nature
of a trap keeps us on our guard If
we once fall into one we resole it
shall be the last time Suspicion kills
confidence Interrogatie hints are ut
terly useless The aerage man does
not dislike to be questioned He hates
to be startled, crossed, interfered with,
reproached, wearied or betrayed He
hates the questions which are not ask
ed with a simple Intention
There are questions which are asked
not because the asker wants to know,
but because he intends to tell Others,
while ostensibly directed to find out a
man's opinion, are really intended to
reflect upon his character Some men
inquire as to their neighbors' projects
in order to put difficulties in their way
Strings of meaningless questions are
poured outJby those who desire to pre
tend an interest in some subject which
they neither know nor care anything
about
We beliee the conclusion of the mat
ter to be thisPersonal The art of Interrogation
Is a serious branch of the social art
Well nsked questions are of the essence
of agreeable Intercourse, but the in
terrogatie mood will not Justify an
impertinence, an interference, a erbal
assault— nor, for the matter of that, a
bore— London Spectator
PHIL MAY'S BARGAIN

a Ilo ln Conjurer
An amusing story is told of the artist
Phil May and an English conjurer at a
fair atl3tratfordonAon Phil was in
the crowd which bad gathered to watch
a ery cleer gentleman who was wrap

pieces of paper and selling them for 2
shillings The "sharp"' had a beautiful
face— such a face as Phil May loed to
ilraw So he sketched him furtiely
But the gentleman saw him and made
a speech forthwith
"If that there celebrited portrit paint

tip the picter, the equally celebrited
benefactor to 'oomanity wot is glln'
away quids for coppers will reward 'im
accordingly," he shouted
 Phil, with a twinkle in his eye, hand
ed up the drawing The conjurer was
delighted with the sketch and pinned it
to the tailboard of his cart With an
other preliminary speech, he threw
three soereigns, three half soereigns
and seeral half crowns into a piece of
paper, screwed it up and handed it to
the artist "You'll be president of the
bloomln' R'yal academy some dye,
young man," said he "Here, catch!"
"A bargain's a bargain," said Phil,
walking off with the packet of gold and
slier
He coufessed afterward when he
opened the packet and found two pen
nies and a halfpenny in it that It was
tbe most entertaining commission be
had eer been paid for

HOW EAGLES FIGHT
A Fnrioua Battle Between Two of
the Big Birds
A small party of gentlemen, most all
of whom had tinges of sporting procli
ities in their blood, were discussing the
subject of chicken fighting An old
farmer from Rappahannock county,
Va, broke into the conersation
"Gentlemen," said he, "in my time I
hae seen some bang up chicken fights,
but the greatest fight I eer saw be
tween birds In all my born days was a
contest between a bald eagle and a
gray eagle near my old place in Rappa
hannock 
"This fight took place on the bank of
the rler  I couldn't forget It if I lied
to be as oldqs Methuselah I was the
only spectator and saw the struggle
from start to finish The bald eagle
had caught a muskrnt and was about
to eat it for breakfast when the gray
eagle soared down and attempted to
rob the other one of Its prey Then
commenced the combat, and, Lord, how
the feathers flew! They fought with
wings, beaks and talons, and I could
hear the talons crack when they struck
and tore each other The sounds made
by their wings as they buffeted one an
were like explosions of musketry,
while their screams and yells sounded
demoniacal The battle lasted fully
fifteen minutes and wound up with a
ictory for old baldy, who droe the
gray eagle away and then resumed his
Interrupted breakfast
"Oh, yes, there are a great many ea
gles up in my part of the state," said
the old agriculturist in reply to a ques
tion "There are plenty of high rocks
and lofty trees whereon they build
their nests We farmers do not gie
them any latitude, howeer Wheneer
one of these big birds is seen soaring
about the poultry yard, or, in fact, any
where about the farm, it's 'Johnnie, get
your gun,', because it not infrequently
happens that good sized chickens, young
lambs or little pigs are carried away by
them, so they're ery unwelcome isit

MISSINGWORS
Annoying Gaps In English Langnai*
That Clue Inconenience*
The English language may fairly
claim to be the most prolific in the
world Not content with Its natie
riches It possesses In a special degree
the faculty of assimilating eerything
useful from other tongues, ancient and
modern It ought Indeed to be the
most perfect ehicle of thought In the
world, Personal and in some respects no doubt
it is U 
But, curiously, enough, there are de
ficiencies In English not to be found in
far less copious languages While In
many cases we hae half a dozen
words expressing the same or prac
tically the same thing, there are, on
the other hand, certain Ideas that hae
no appropriate words to express them
In the words denoting relationship
some notable gaps are found The
most glaring instance is the' want of a
word to distinguish between a male
and female cousin Other languages,
such as French and Italian, hare a sep
arate word for  each, but in English
some addition or explanation is re
quired In order to make it clear which
sex is Intended '
Curious gaps occur here and there in
our language If we look into it The
word "show" expresses the idea of
making to see, but there la no word for
making to hear— a phonograph, for ex
ample "I took the phonograph to my
friend and"— * What? "Got him to
listen to it" would probably be the In
elegant finish to the sentence'
On the other hand, "audience", means
those who hear and applies ery well
to those present In a lecture hall or con
cert room But what of those who see
a cricket match, for Instance? "Spec
tators" Is the nearest word, but it does
not correspond exactly to "audience"
There is one deficiency in the lan
guage so awkward and "Irritating that
een at this late hour it ought to be
made good Need It be said that refer
ence is made to indiscriminate use of
the personal pronoun to denote either
the person speaking or the person
spoken of? This may not be a defect
peculiar to English, but it is one from
which the ancient classical tongues are
entirely free
"He said he had offered him money,
which he had declined," would be quite
comprehensible either in Greek or Lat
in, but in English it necessitates a num
ber of bracketed explanations which
are positiely annoying and destructie
of grace and fluency— London • An

It is just a common cold, people say,

common we could feel quite safe But we
can't The uncommon ariety; is rarely
recognized until it has fastened its hold on
the lungs, and there are symptoms of con
sumption
At the first symptoms the careful person
will heed the warning by talcing a mild

disturb the system or cause griping About
the best is "r Pierces Pleasant Pellets"

RANK OF COUNTIES IN TAX
RATE
From a statement just issued from
the state controller's office, giing
the rate of taxation and the assessed
aluation of property in the different
counties for the year 1903, it appears
Jh&t there are thirty counties in the
state haing a lower tax rate than
Amador county; fie other counties
haing the same rate, $2 on the $100;
and twenty haing a higher tax rate
The banner county in low tax ley is
Yolo, with a rate of $145 Trinity
and Sierra counties are tied for the
honor of the highest ley, with a
rate of $3 each The popular idea
that the necessities of the goern
, ment are controlled in a measure by
the amount of assessable property
and the" number of inhabitants does
not always agree with the facts
Alpine county, for instance, has a
total aluation of only $422,063; its
population does not reach 500
Moreoer it has a floatirig indebted
ness of $16,63620 Its oting
strength is not more than 100 Yet
notwithstanding these drawbacks, it
manages to keep up its county or
ganization on a tax rate of $170 on
the $^00 There are only eight coun
ties with a lower rate This is high
ly flattering to the managers of our
mountain neighbor to the east The
total reenue from property taxes
is less than $8000 With this slender
income, reinforced from a few other
sources, a set of county officials is
maintained, schools kept up, roads
repaired, the laws enforced, and in
deed all the paraphernalia of go
ernment maintained Alpine coun
ty has reason to be proud of its
record And notwithstanding its
low cost, it is probably true that it
is as efficiently goerned as any
county in the state, considering the
circumstances Goernmental effi
ciency does not depend upon the
amount of financial resources at the
command of the authorities Indeed,
wealth of resources often gies birth
to extraagant and incompetent
management Alpine county has
been compelled to economize It
has nothing upon which to put on
extraagant airs This admission
does not detract one jot from the
credit due to the eniable position
which it occupies in the sisterhood
of counties There are no boodlers,
because there is" no scope for the
boodler to operate without a nine
toone chance of being detected A
few years back the condition of
affairs in Alpine, its anishing pop
ulation and decrease in taxable prop
erty, gae rise to some talk about
the surrender of its county organi
zation It was thought to be too
much of a burden for her people to
sustain But all such misgiings
hae been dispelled by experience
Instead of enying her neighbors,
she is pointed to as an example to be
imitated by them Not one of her
adjoining counties can boast of any
thing like such a low tax rate
Under the circumstances, Alpine
people may well congratulate them
seles upon the success of their
efforts at selfgoernment, in face of
difficulties which a few years back
seemed almost insurmountable
The eastern elections last Tuesday
leae no cause for discouragement
from a republican standpoint The
party strength is unimpaired This
is all the more significant because of
the many occurrences in the indus
trial centers which it was thought
might disturb the political situation
The sole comfort of the democrats is
that they carry Rhode Island by a
greatly reduced majority, and elect
the Tamany candidate for Mayor of
New York Ohio disposes of the as
pirations of Tom Johnson for presi
dential honors by burying him under
a majority of 125,000 Massachusetts,
New Jersey, Nebraska, lowa, Colo
rado and' Pennsylania, roll up their
old time majorities for the republi
can tickets The outlook for the
presidential contest next year is as
f iorable as could be desired by re
publicans The sheling of Johnson
of Ohio, gies a boost for W Hearst
for the democratic nomination
GRAN JURY INVESTIGATION
A grand jury will meet in Jackson
next Friday The gathering of this
body in Amador county has been
more in the nature of a farce than
anything else A tour of the county
buildings, the jail and hospital, is
usually made, and eerything is
found to be in applepie order, and
in a few stereotyped phrases the ad
ministration of county affairs pro
nounced all right, and the mutual ad
miration society breaks up with all
round congratulations As far as
the inestigation of criminal busi
ness is concerned, the grand jury
system has long since been practi
cally abolished The only useful
purpose it can now sere is the oer
hauling of the management ofcoun
ty affairs, with the iew of correct
ing any eils that may be found to
be connected therewith It is sup
posed to be an inquisitorial body of
men, entirely disinterested in the
matters to be inestigated, except
as taxpayers, charged with the duty
of looking into the whole range of
local affairs during the preceding
year Such a doty cannot be proper
ly discharged in the course of a 'few
hours If the duty is thoroughly
performed, though days are occupied
in its performance, the salutary ef
fect it would exercise upon those in
authority would be well worth the
money expended On the other hand,
a slipshod performance is a useless
squandering of public money Let
it be understood that a grand jury
meeting means a keen and business
like prying into eery nook and cor
ner of public affairs in Amador coun
ty, and a fearless report of things
as they are actually found to be, and
who can calculate the benefits that
would flow therefrom There are
some matters in this county that
need oerhauling We might refer
particularly to the method of spend
ing the road funds, representing
fully onefourth of the total ex
penses of the local goernment Is
the system in ogue in this county
in accordance with law? If it is not,
it is time it was stopped, and a legal
system adopted In Mariposa coun
ty, a year ago, this matter was taken
up, and reported upon by a grand
jury with decidedly beneficial re
sults We can see no reason why
the same example should not be fol
lowed in Amador county The ques
tion has been agitated here for
years, without change It is now
eident that stern decisie action by
an authoritatie body is necessary
to uproot the eil
ALL WANT FEES
In the list of claims allowed by the
superisors will be noticed a large
number of bills allowed constables
and justices in the different town
ships The explanation of the rush
of this class of bills is that the town
ship officers, now that the salary
matter is before the supreme court,
hae concluded to accept the offer
of payment of fees under the old law
pending the decision of the appellate
court on the matters in controersy
All the taik about these officers be
ing compelled to sere without com
pensation until the final determina
tion of the suit is thereby exploded
There was nothing to it in the first
place They might hae drawn
their fees under the old law right
along, as far as the auditor and dis
trict attorney were concerned But
it suited the plans of some to try to
make it appear that they were being
unjustly kept out of their money
because of the appeal proceedings,
and that unless the appeal was with
drawn they would be compelled to
resign their 'offices, because they
could not afford to wait two^jears
for their pay They hae not re
signed, and they are actually draw
ing their pay; if not all of them, at
least all those who hae bent their
pride to the extent of presenting
their claims for fees So we pre
sume eerything "will now moe
along smoothly until the case is
finally disposed of by the supreme
court We may here state that the
questions inoled in this justice's
salary case hae assumed statewide
importance In Humboldt county
the same point is being fought out
in the courts And the interests in
oled are deemed so ital that the
two superior judges of that county
are expected to sit in bank in the
hearing of the case, and unite in for
mulating the decision The issue is
traeling up to the higher court
from all directions In some coun
ties they are contesting the law be
cause it reduces, and in others be
cause it increases compensation,
but in all of them it is fought on the
ground of the unconstitutionally of
the classification of townships by
population for the purpose of fixing
salaries
In the three cornered fight for the
mayoralty of San Francisco, Schmitz,
the union labor candidate, was
elected to succeed himself, beating
Crocker, the republican nominee, by
5000 otes Lane, the standard
bearer of democracy, was not in it
The democratic party in San Fran
cisco has gone to pieces Hassett,
the democratic candidate, was elect
ed Mayor of Sacramento This re
sult in a republican stronghold, waa
brought about by the liquor interest
and the labor element throwing their
weightfor Hassett, against Elkus,
the republican candidate

Halloween Franks
uring Saturday night a crowd of
boys, from ten to twenty in number,
celebrated Halloween by playing all
sorts of queer pranks around town
Signs were changed all oer town
Some of the jokes were good as prac
tical jokes go One of the best was the
remoal of the sign, "Miners' Union
Hall," from the miners' hall on Court
street, and placing the same oer the
Ledger office sign in the front of the
Webb Hail building In this conspicui
ous place it was noticed by eerybody
passing along the street, and caused
considerable merriment, and no par
ticular barm Many other mixups of
signs were indulged in, also the re
moal of gates and other articles that
wore remoable added to confusion
The sign of Henry Weil announcing
"clearance sale of thirty days," was
changed to thirty "years," and in such
antics the boys oerstepped themseles
Their fun degenerated into destructie
ness The prankers were out until
three o'clock Sunday morning In
some other cities the authorities gae
notice that practical jokes of the kind
mentioned would not be tolerated, but
would subject the jokers to arrest
Some of the youngsters up all night at
this mischief in Jackson were not more
than 14 or 15 years of age
A Rational Organization,
A national employers' association
has just been organized in Chicago Its
aim is to form branches in eery state
in the union, for the purpose of pro
tecting the business interests of the
country against the undue incroach
ments of labor organization upon the
rights of the employers It is not de
signed to fight labor unions as such
Labor unions are all right when proper
ly managed, and confined to their
legitimate sphere The country has
had too many examples of their being
unwisely led, with the result of throt
tling enterprise, and creating distrust
and uucertainty in business circles, to
the detriment of all concerned One
sided organization by the employes
tends to weaken that feeling of mutuali
ty of interest which is essential to the
prosperity of both employer and em
ploye They must both work hand in
hand to secure the best results But
too of ton the labor unions foster the
idea that to fight the employers is the
path of safety and prosperity for their
members With the might of num
bers they manage to secure concessions,
which tend C spur them on to make
further demands The employer is
placed at a disadantage It is one
man against many To offset this dis
parity tho employers propose to or
gauizo after the pattern of the trades
unions It is not dictated by a spirit
of hostility to tho workingmen On
the contrary, it is belieed that har
mony can best bo secured by the em
ployers placing themseles in a position
to bo able to resist any encroachment
upon their rights It is peace not war,
that this counter organization seeks to
bi'ing about Tho agitators who would
preach a crusade against capital are
the worst onemies of the laboring class
eath of Frank Frate*
Frank Frates, tho wellknown citi
zen of lono, who has been in charge of
tho cattle and coal interests for the lone
Coal and Iron Company for many years,
died early Saturday morning, after a
sickness of a few days He was seized
with a iolent pain in the chest while
attonding a Masonic lodge meeting in
lone on Wednesday night The attack
was so serious that the medical attend
ant remained with him all night It
was feared that it would end fatally at
that time The following day he was
considerably better, and on Friday the
improement continued to such a de
gree that it was belieed the crisis had
passed About midnight, howeer,
the alarming symptoms returned, and
death ensued at four o'clock Saturday
morning The funeral took place in
lone Sunday afternoon, under the
auspices of the Masonic fraternity, of
which he was a member in high stand
ing He was also a member of the
A O U W, of the Companions of the
Forest, and Mystic Shriners Fully
300 brethren Of the different orders at
tended the funeral His wife died se
eral months ago in San Francisco, and
was buried in that city It was his
wish that the remains of his wife be
disinterred, and that the bodies rest
side by side in the lone cemetery His
wish in this respect will no doubt bo
complied with
Application for Pardon
In another column appears the notice
of Neil A Macquarrie of intention to
apply to the prison directors for parole
Macquarrie was conicted of forgery
committed in this county about two
years ago He has been in San Quentin
prison for 18 months His health is
broken, and it is not likely that he will
eer be a well man again Thero are
many in Jackson who beliee he has
sufficiently suffered for his crime, and
his application for pardon ought to
command the support pf the community
generally He forged a chock on a
Stockton bank for $50, and passed the
same on the Red Front store, receiing
goods and change in return
Rainfall
A rainstorm set in Wednesday morn
ing about 7 o'clock, and continued
steadily until 1 o'clock It was quite a
heay fall, measuring 114 inches in
Jackson, making 157 for the season,
against 21nches for the same period
last year A much larger quantity of
water fell higher up the mountains
At Whitmore's mill the storm con
tinued until 3 o'clock in the afternoon
The rainfall remoes all danger of a
shortage of water for mining and
electrical power this season For agri
cultural purposes more rain is needed,
as the ground is hardly in condition
to admit of plowing

THE PERILS OF MINING
A Miner, William Mitchell, Loses His
Life in the South Eureka in a Peculiar
Manner
The perils incident to the life of the
miner were signally illustrated last Sun
day at the South Eureka by a peculiar
accident, causing the death of a trusted
employe named William Mitchell On
the morning in question the unfortun
ate ictim was employed in repairing
the track at the 1700 and 1800 leels
The work was not new to him But
by a simplo oersight, due no doubt to
thoughtlessness, his life was sacrificed
A piece of spiling was left on the plat
form This spiling, the testimony went
to show, had been placed there by him
self The ond of it projected about an
inch or so oer tbe platform into the
shaft He was standing on this spil
ing, unconscious of danger, and prob
ably did not know, that the end of the
stick protruded into tbe opening The
north skip came down, and struck the
projecting end of the spiling, and_
threw Mitchell into the shaft He fell
100 feet James Henry Bistian, who
was working within a few feet of the
ictim at tho time, heard no noise of
any kind when the accident occurred,
and only knew what had happened by
missing his companion Samuel J
Hocking and other employes went down
the shaft, and found Mitchell still
breathing He neer spoke, and lied
only a few seconds after they reached
him
An inquest was held near the mine
by Coroner Huberty on Sunday after
noon, before the followingjurorsPersonal John
L Cox, John Ward, Joe Martin, John
Rule, Chester Bernardis, John Moli
nari, John Cornd rig and J L Vanda
ment A erdict was returned of acci
dental death
eceased was a single man, and has
no relaties in the county He had
been employed at the South Eureka
about two months, and was uniersally
liked by his fellow workers
Filling Up the Creek Bed
A remarkable instance of the rapidity
with which the bed of streams may be
filled up by detritus carried from high
land is afforded by the condition of
Jackson creek at a point in Jackson
alley near tho school house, where the
stream is bridged by what is known as
Jackson alley bridge This is about
four miles below Buena Vista It is
well in tho alley, " where tho force of
the flood waters is arrested by the re
duced fall This bridge was built in
1892 At that time the distance from
the bridge to the creek bed was oer
seen foet This was deemed ample
room to accommodate any freshet
Superisor Arcick has jut had the
bridee raised two feet The debris
washod from tho mountains had so
filled up the channel as to leae only
two feet from the crook bud to the
bridge Besides this, for seeral sea
sons past workmen hae had to be em
ployed in clearing out the dobris to
•preent the almost total choking of the
water way It is estimated that during
the past 11 years the bod of the creek,
taking tho cleaning out process into
consideration, has been raised fully
seen feet— an aerage of nearly 8
inches each year The bridge is now
eleated considerably aboe tbe leel
of the adjacent land, and allows about
four feet for flood waters It will tako
a long time to fill up this space, because
in flood time tbe water will spread con
siderably oer the banks, thereby fill
ing up the banks at about the same
ratio as tbe bed of the creek is filled
up This rapid filling up of the channel
is not entirely duo to the natural wash
from aboe The tailings from the
mines accelerate the process, and also
the pernicious custom of persons liing
along the banks of the streams dump
inp all sorts of rubbish into the chan
nel, to be carried down in flood time,
and deposited in the stream as tbe
elocity of the current is checked by
the decreased fall •; *

Agricultural Station to be Abandoned
The foothills agricultural experiment
station situated about six miles north
east of Jackson, is about to be aband
oned This station has been in exist
ence for fourteen years It has been
maintained by the joint support of the
United Statos and the state goern
ments, each contributing one half the
expense For the last few years the
state has withdrawn its support, and it
is a question of finances more than any
thing elso that has led to its abandon
ment J H Barber, who has been in
charge of the station for oer two
years, informs us that it will be sur
rendered to the trustees, for the benefit
of Jackson, on the first of next month
The station originally consisted of
twenty acres, which was presented to
the goernment, together with a dwell
ing for the superintendent, by the peo
ple of Jackson and icinity, on the
understanding that if for any reason it
should be abandoned the title would
reert to the donors The grounds
comprising the station, now including
one or two tracts purchased since its
establishment, hae been brought to a
high degree of cultiation It has cer
tainly proed what this foothill land is
capable of producing when carefully
cultiated It has been a pleasure re
sort and an ornament to this section,
and eeryone will regret its abandon
ment It was not started as a per
manent institution The experimental
purposes haing been sered, it is al
lowed to lapse, the horticultural inter
ests in this section not being sufficiently
important to justify its continuance
This is not because our foothills are
not suited to fruits, but because the
lack of rapid and cheap transportation
in the shape of railroad facilities is a
bar to enterprise in this direction

NATIVE PLATINUM
The "Noble" MetaU Extracted From
This Peculiar Substance
On the slopes of the Ural mountains
and in Brazil, California, Australia,
Cttnada and many other countries a pe
culiar substance kaown as natie plati
num is foundPersonal This is an alloy of the
metals platinum, palladium, iridium,
osmium, rhodium and ruthenium, to
gether with a little gold and iron All
of these except the last mentioned are
tho "noble" metals They do not tar
nish in the air and are not soluble in
any single acid The most plentiful
metal occurring in natie platinum la
that from which it takes its \ name
This metal is of a grayish color and
with one exception Is the heaiest sub
sthnce kimwiy Its fusing point is ex
tremely high, and this property, to
gether with its freedom from tarnish
ing, causes it to be largely used for the
manufacture of crucibles and other
essels required by scientists to stand
a ery high temperature It is also
sometimes used as a substitute for gold
In photography, and when deposited in
a thin film on the interior of the tubes
of telescopes it forma a dead black
surface, which preents the light from
being reflected by the polished sides
Palladium is of a lustrous white
color It is the most easily fused of
tbe metals found in platinum ore, and
can een be olatilized A curious
quality which this metal possesses is
that when heated to redness it is
porous to hydrogen gas, allowing it to
pass through somewhat in the saini^
manner that blotting paper permits the
passage of water The silery white
color of palladium and its freedom
from tarnishing render it useful for
making scales and diision marks on
scientific instruments A mixture of
this metal with mercury is sometimes
used for filling teeth Osmium is a
metal which possesses two remarkable
properties— it is the most refractory
of the metals, resisting fusion at tlSo
most Intense heat, and it is also the
heaiest substance known, beingtwen
tytwo and a half times heaier than
water Together with iridium, it oc
curs principally in a peculiar ariety of
natie platinum called osmlridlum
This mineral differs from ordinary
platinum ore in that it contains a
larger proportion of osmium and Irid
ium than Personal platinum Osmlridlum is
found in small particles, arying in
weight from onesixth to onethird of
a grain These particles are extremely
hard and are used for pointing non
wearing pens
 Metallic Iridium possesses a white
steellike appearance The knife edges
of delicate balances and other bearings
which require extreme hardness are
often made of it An alloy of 10 per
cent iridium and 00 per cent platinum
has been found to be ery little affected
In olume by changes of temperature
and Is the substance of which the
standard meter kept in the internation
al metric bureau at Paris is made
Rhodium and ruthenium are metals of
little practical use The former occurs
in platinum ore to, tho extent of 5 to C
per cent The latter is found only in
osmirldlum and aerages about 5 per
cent of that mineral • The metal which
ranks next to platinum in price is zir
conium, which occurs in hyacinth and
some other rare minerals Uranium is
remarkable for Its high atomic weight,
the heaiest known— Chambers' Jour
nal
The Sedan Chair
The sedan chair is named after Se
dan, the town where it was first used
The earliest mention of it in England
occurs In 1581 Early in the following
century the uke of Buckingham
caused much indignation by its use in
London People were exasperated at
that nobleman employing his fellow
men to take the place of horses to car
ry him Prince Charles brought from
Spain in 1623 three curiously wrought
sedans, two of which he gae to the
uke of Buckingham A few weeks
after their Introduction Masslnger pro
duced his play, "The Bondman," and
in lt he thus aderts to the ladiesPersonal

PATHS OF THE OCEAN
ORIGIN OF THE LANES TRAVERSF
BY ATLANTIC LINERS
Tin Northern and Southern Itoatea
to and From Enrope, aa Indicated
by Lieutenant Manry— Minimising
 the uuger of Collisions
In reports of the arrial of an ocean
iiner the statement sometimes appeard
';hPersonalit she came "by the southern route"
to aoid Ice or that she made her first
I rip of the season "by the northern
lane" To the ordinary reader the Idea
of lnnes or pathways on what we hae
lieen taught to think of as "the track
less sea" seems somewhat paradoxical,
but If you consult the charts In the of
fice of a KtPiimshin manager or in the
United States hydrographlc office Instead
of the ordinary map you will find that
there are four well defined highways
across the north Atlantic as clearly
marked to the naigator's perception
as is a time worn turnpike on land to
the eyes of the pedestrian
It is oer these great ocean thorough
fares that the Atlantic fliers, with their
tens of thousands of passengers and
their hundreds of thousands of tons of
freight, pass on their oyages between
America and Europe They are closely
adhered to by all fast steam essels
and just as carefully aoided by sail
ing ships and by the fishermen who ply
their trade off the Grand banks The
situation of a small craft on the liners'
route would be comparable to that of
a man driing a light runabout along a
railway truck cleared for the fast lim
ited, for these main traeled lines hae
been set aside by custom and agree
ment for the Atlantic's lightning ex
presses Nobody is delayed at sidings
or confined to special tracks, howeer,
for the rest of the ocean is left to the
ordinary mariner 
It is only a few years since the tracks
upon which the great liners shall run
hae been so clearly defined Eer since
the commerce of the north Atlantic as
sumed important proportions sailing
musters hae followed in a general
way the great circle that cures north
ward from the west coast of England
and Ireland until it reaches about 46
degrees north latitude in mldocean,
then bears southwestward past the
coast of Newfoundland and Cape Race
Early experience proed that this was
the shortest and so, of course, tho
quickest route between Europe and
such ports as Boston, New York and
Philadelphia
While steam naigators kept fairly
neitr this course it was natural
enough that they should ary from lt
somewhat according to the theories of
indiidual captains With the multipli
cation of steamships and the rapid In
crease in speed the ery fact that all
the larger and swifter essels kept to
one particular part of the ocean greatly
increased the danger of collision be
tween them When forty or fifty swift
steamers were crossing the Atlantic at
the same time in one direction or the
other, all keeping to the same general
course irrespectie of the direction In
which they were traeling, it was ob
ious that the 'of two of
them coining together in thick weather
was too great to be contemplated pleas
antly
 So Lieutenant Maury of the United
States nay made the suggestion that
all fast steamships should traerse cer
tain lixeil routes, which he Indicated
paths, following the great circle pretty
closely, for it was natural that the
steamship companies would not agree
to the adoption of any route that in
oled a loss of time in making the
ocean passage
The most Important proision sug
gested by Lieutenant Maury was that
essels going in opposite directions
should obsere the rules of the road by
passing one another on the port side
To carry out this plan he proposed that
west bound essels should keep about
one degree to the northward of those
east bound Thus the greatest danger
from the following of indiscriminate
routes— that of collision between fast
ships— would be aoided While it Is
desirable in point of time for ships to
steer their course far to the north, the
presence of ice aud fog in the high lat
itudes makes it impracticable for them
to do so during fully half tße year Ac
cordingly, Lieutenant Maury proided
for two great highways, one for sum
mer, the other for winter, one about
three degrees to the northward of the
other and each with west bound and
east bound tracks
Tho rialry between the different
lines was so great at that time that
each hesitated to gie unconditional
adherence to the plan, fearing that
some other would gain an adantage
Two prominent steamship managers,
howeer, quickly appreciated the ad
antages of Lieutenant Maury's plan
and independently of their competitors
gae instructions to their captains to
follow the lines laid down by him
These two men were Clement A Grls
com, then the head of the American
line, and Thomas 11 Ismay, director of
the White Star line As these two lines
then owned the fastest and most per
fect ships on the Atlantic, the influence
of their example was ery powerful
There Is no doubt that the adoption
of these lanes has been of the utmost
importance in Increasing the safety of
oceau trael and possesses distinct ad
antages aside from eliminating the
possibility of head on collisions be^
tween the liners Extra precautions
are taken to keep the great highway
clear of derelicts and other floating
dangers or to gie warning of theii
presence
Since tho masters of sailing essels
know the steamer routes, they consult
their own safety by aoiding them anc
by keeping a sharp lookout wheneei
lt is necessary to cross them in eithei
direction — New York Mail and Ex

THE ETERNAL FEMININE
Womanly Sympathy, Not Intellecta
ality, Counts at Last
"I got another glimpse of the 'eternal
feminine' recently," says a Washington
physician, "and I shall neer again ex
press surprise that men of admitted in
tellect should marry women who are
not their mental equals Among my
patients for the last few weeks— in
fnct, until he died— was a man of re
markable ability and character The
case had been in the hands of another
doctor, and when I took charge I saw
that there was little hope of recoery
The illness was complicated and, I will
confess, difficult of diagnosis, and it
was not until shortly before the fatal
termination that all the symptoms de
eloped
"The patient's wife was a little wo
man whom one could best describe by
the term 'sweet' I neer saw greater
deotion displayed in the sick room
Her anxiety was pathetic, her watch
ful care unceasing, and I grew to look
up to her But I neer could explain to
her just what was the matter with her
husband, although after I really found
out I made the most perspiring efforts
to do so 
* " 'How is he today, doctor?' she
would say In the most pathetic fashion
The first time she put the query I went
into details by way of explanation '
" 'The danger from pneumonia has
diminished to a certain extent,' I said,
'but from the heart action I notice cer
tain symptoms of cardltis which gie
ery little grounds for hope' Then I
would continue to explain the trend of
the disease so simply, I thought, that a
child could understand it When I con
cluded she nodded intelligently and
said in a manner so pathetically sweet
that my heart went out to herPersonal
"'I understand But, doctor, how do
you think he is?'
"J groaned Inwardly and made some
reply, holding out little hope, and ne
er again attempted to go into detail
But as I watched her during the trying
days until the end came I forgot all
about her failure to comprehend my
explanation I forgot eerything, in
fact, except that I was a witness of
that wonderful depth of affection ~xA
which the feminine nature alone is ca
pable, and lt would hae made no dif
ference to me if she had not been able
to say her alphabet I honored her as

The assertion that Boston was the lit

—during the period in which American
literature acquired a shelf of its own in
