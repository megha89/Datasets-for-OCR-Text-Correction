THE ACTION OF GLACIERS
Its Relation to the Precious
Metal.
GREAT 6RAVR BEDS PASS THROUGH THE SIERRA
Many Side Channels of Fine Gravel
Carry Gold In Paying Quantities
Covered by Clay, etc.
JOHN A. FAULL
Leaving this feature of the case we
will deal with visible facts, and for a
moment follow the Mokelumne river,
in conjunction willi lln< Calaveras river
in Calaveras county, from the moun
tains to "the plains. Wo find deposited
on the uplands jof the I North San Joa
quin valley" gravel beds, lava and
cement covering 528,000 acres of land,
• much of . the . top level; ; hence, called
table lands or mountains. Upon these
uplands there are thousands of acres of
cement gravel, laying in sheets, step
upon step, almost us regular as a pair
of stairs, proving, if further proof
were necessary, the actual glacial flo\y,
the mountains to the oast being de
nuded. If we follow the north and
south channels on the side of the main
mountain chain, we will find the lava
frequently 300 feet thick, but. all slop
ing toward the, valley, with, side chan
nels and overflows just as a glacial drift
would be 1 expected to do,' judging by
the action of the living glacier of to
day in the Alps of Switzerland, the
Pyrenees and our own Alaskan glacier,
and that millions of tons of rock were
carried upon. the top of these moun
tains of ice, admits of little doubt.
The numerous vertical walls found
along our mountain ranges is another
evidence of the glacial motion. Look
at Greenland, where nearly the whole
of the interior of the country is one
vast field of ice, all moving toward the
sea upon a gentle slope.
We will, however, deal with things
at home before going afield. Look at
the North Yuba at Downieville, Sierra
county. Here we find the main north
: and south channels . swept away, mak
ing deposits of every imaginable form,
boulders of immense size intermixed
with'gravel, sand aud mud,' in bunches,
bars and ravines for twenty-seven
miles along its course. The bed of this
stream was exceedingly rich in coarse
gold. At Downieville, and for some
distance below, many of the large boul
ders were found upon the top of the
gravel beds.' If the' deposit had been
made by any river, except that of a
glacier, the large boulders would be
found in the bottom of the stream,
next to the bedrock. As we follow
down the stream' the -gold found is in
much finer particles and smooth. The
esealey character told how it had been
rubbed with the contact of the rocks,
gravel and sand. Its siK-ciiic gravity
being great, the heavier particles
reached the bedrock, while the fine
gold was found in the red 'earth," cover
ing much of the gravel ranges, more
especially that portion covering the
- hydraulic fields.
Thj imagination is at a loss to ac
count for the- disintegration commen
surate with the magnitude of the de
posit fouud hereinbefore spoken of,
unless, indeed,' the mythical Atlantis
can be found. Tbe question has ofteu
been asked, "How came it that many of
those gravel channels are so deeply
depressed amid the mountains?" Let.
us look at the question from a practical
standpoint. There is an apparent de
pression, but the hills to the west of
all the great gravel channels, of what
ever size and depth— call them what
jou pjeaso— are surrounded by second
ary hills. If the slope of the bedrock
has been taken there is not a channel
that could not be drained by a tunnel
system of a little less than foirV and
three-eighth miles in length. ■" This
being true, it docs away with tbe
Huttonian theory of depressions in the
earth's" crust,' "which were filled by
some unknown force or the Neptunian
theory of Warner. Even if the rocks
decayed in the atmosphere the ruins
would not accumulate as they are now
found | unless ' the accumulation - took
place under the sea. We are not seek
ing a beginning nor an end, but look
ing at things as we find them and deal
ing with practical - questions, and,
indeed, without any regard to geo
logical changes ■ that may have taken
place in the world's history.
lam well aware that the position
here taken is contested by numerous
I men proficient in their profession as
mineralogists and geologists, that have
studied the high lands between the
Middle and South Yuba rivers as cov
ered by volcanic ash and breccia.
With this question I take direct issue,
and claim as a matter of fact that the
region under consideration is, to all
intents and purposes,' a glacial mud,
solidified under pressure, partly crys
tallized by time and atmospheric action
since the deposition. This is possible,
and I think more than probable, the
same channel as that found at Mokel
umno Hill, in Calaveras county. For
more specific information on this ques
tion we would suggest that one go to
the Smilkameen mining district in
British Columbia. He will there en
counter to the satisfaction of himself
the precise line of the glacial action,
or he can go to Virginia City, Mont.,
Boise Basin, Idaho, or Catnaloops,
Carriboo and Cassiar, British Columbia.

Gold Dredging in New Zealand.
Tho success of dredging as a branch
of the gold mining industry in New
Zealaud is now so firmly established
and so widely recognized as to call for
little comment. In the spact of the
last thirty years, gold dredging has
advanced by leaps and bounds, as each
fresh | improvement upon the early
crude attempts has been added with
satisfactory and stimulating results.
It is now about thirty-four years, as
far as can be ascertained, since the first
attempt to dredge the River Molyneux
was made.' The machine then em
ployed consisted merely of a strong
iron ring, technically; known as a spoon,
to which was secured an ox-hide bag
and a long pole. The process of dredg
ing was as simple \as tho means em
ployed. A rope was fastened to the
aforesaid . iron ring and secured to a
hand winch on the bank of the river.
The bucket and pole were taken out
and dropped into the stream by means
of a boat, the bucket being pressed by
the pole as deep as possible into tho
wash in the bed of. the river. All that
remained to be done was to haul the
bucket ashore with the help of the
winch, the contents being then cradled
in an ordinary miner's cradle. — W. H.

The canvass was exceedingly exciting
because of the near approach of War,
and all the questions incident to it were
discussed wiih much animation.
Charges— and countercharges were
made. Both sides knew • that about
six votes either way would determine
the contest, and on the day before the
election -Walker raised the point on
Vest that he had stolen some pigs.
The only way that Vest could meet the
charge was to acknowledge .smilingly
that he had the pigs in | his pen and in
his possession. I If he bad gone further
and said that ho had bought them—
which they hoped he would do— Xhoy
had witnesses to show that he had not
bought them, but Vest was too shrewd

CALAVERAS COUNTY-
Citizen, San Andreas, February 34, HUM
A recent telegraphic dispatch states
that Robert 'White-side of Duluth,
Minnesota, • has practically purchased
the Calaveras Big Treo ! Grove, having
paid the company owning tho forest
$1000 for an . option of ', ninety days.
The price asked for the grove, which
consists of 3800 acres, is $100,000. Mr.
Whiteside has already purchased 5000
acres of timber land west of the Cala
veras grove and has bonded two other
large tracts east and south of the Big
Tree Park.
A joint resolution was presented in
Congress last week authorizing tbe Sec
retary of tbe Interior to open negotia
tions for the bonding of the Calaveras
county groves of sequoi gigautea for a
government park, and tho adoption of
the resolution may prevent the com
pletion of the deal for the sale of this
timber land.
Some encouragement has been re
ceived by the ladies of : the California
Club, who are deeply interested in pre
serving the giant redwood forests of
the State. A dispatch was received bj
the ladies from Congressman Kahu in
forming the club that the matter had
been brought to the attention of Con
gress and that the California delega
tion is taking particular interest in the
subject. Congressman DeVries is doing
everything possible in the matter to
cave them from destruction.
A set of resolutions passed by the
California Club was forwarded to Cong
ress and has been presented to that
body. The matter has been taken up
by the Federation of Clubs and now
over thirty clubs, representing 18,000
women, are working to preserve the
noble redwoods from the mills of the
men of commerce. The capitalists who
are anxious to purchase the remaining
forests from the present owners are
fast closing their contracts.
Jacob Peterson, of Wallace, a promi
nent and substantial resident of the
county, was found unconscious on the
roadside between Burson and Wallace
on tbe. 10th instant by Mr. Aros of

Despite the efforts of Dr. March, Peter
son died on the 12th, of concussion of
the brain. 'Foul play was hinted and
District Attorney McSorley made an
investigation, which developed that
Peterson was the victim of a runaway
accident and that none of his personal
belongings had been disturbed. Peter
son was buried in Harmony Grove
cemetery at Clements.

Confidence about ten days ago to go to
Arizona. That he spent a couple of
days in Carters before taking the cars,
indulged in liquor to some extent, with
the result that on Wednesday men

despondingly of his prospects. Two
days later he cut his throat with a
pocket knife on a Santa Fe train near
Dagget and was placed under arrest by
the auahorities. He is at present held
at the County Hospital in San Bernar

its effect was to take away the romance

Problem of Coal Supply in Naval Attack.
It is difficult to imagine what might,
have happened if the American "Fly
ing Squadron" had visited the coast of
Spain. ; Imagine a fleet arriviug oif the
enemy's coast with its ooal bunkers
practically empty, and unable to coal
at sea. The advantage would lie with
the enemy, putting out from home
ports with bunkers well rilled. The
programme would be. of course, first
to capture a base wrhero col liers could
lie and warships have their bunkers
replenished. lint tho capture of such
a base might result in the loss of a
ship, and, even though it did not, the
campaign of attack would be ham
pered by the necessity of maintaining
a defense of the colliers, especially
against torpedo-boat attack. This
point is made doubly important since
the submarine torpedo-boat has proved
a success. In contrast to this imagine
that each collier is fitted to coal at sea
and under headway as well. — The

Food Preparation*.
Experiments by Dr. A. McGill of
Canada show that much has yet to be
done before final pronouncements can
be made upon the food value, If any,
of the flesh bases which in most in
stances form a chief portion of the ni
trogenous material In meat extracts,
the fact being that, as these bases cer
tainly differ among themselves In food
value, It is consequently true of the va
rious forms in which proteid matter
occurs In these preparations— viz, as
peptones, proteoses, adds, albumens,
etc. Dr. McGiU's experiments suggest
that a part of the nitrogen tn some
meat preparations exists as urea, the
latter certainly having no food value.
As to Its assumed value as a stimu
lant, Dr. McGill remarks that nature
seems to have provided for the prompt
elimination of urea from the system, it
being also well known that any fail
ure to get rid of It by way of the kid
neys results in serious disturbance of
the vital functions and may end in
death by .uraemia. From the fact that
no practical method has been discover
ed by which a sharp analytical line
can be drawn between the nitrogen
present as urea and that present as
creatln, creatinin and xamtlim flesh
bases cannot, of course, be called food
stuff, In the proper seuse of the term.
Going- to Bed In India.
Going to bed in India Is a very dif

formal process. There Is no shutting

and finally no getting into bed. l'ou
merely lie down on your bed, which,
with Its bedding, Is so simple as to be
worth describing. The bed is a wooden
frame with -webbing laced across It,
and each bed has a thin cotton mat
tress. Over this one sheet Is spread,.

FOR THE FARMER
The growth and decay of vegetation
on and in the soil are yet, as In earth's
earliest ages, the best means for fitting
It for man's use. When vegetation de
cays. It always gives off carbonic acid
pas, which is a more powerful solvent
than water alone. If vegetation con
tains nitrogen, It Is a still more power
ful solvent, says The American Culti
vator, and will make mineral plant
food soluble so that the roots of plants
can take It up. All the earlier vegeta
tion of the world was poor in nitrogen,
but full of carbon absorbed through Its
leaves from the atmosphere, then so
overcharged with carbonic acid ; gas
that none bnt the lowest forms of ani
mal life was possible. After the ferns
decayed bitter plants, such us the
gsains, grasses and clover, could live
and grow. Many a modern farmer who
cannot grow clover finds that if he
sows a field with some grain which has
a' large seed It will furnish him
enough carbonic add gas to liberate
some ef the nitrogen and minerals
which the clover needs and which were
already In the soil, but not In form for
clover roots to feed on. In almost ev
erything the good farmer does to deep
en and Improve his land he Is co-op
erating with forces that were at work
■Jong before human life began on this
planet Even then It was being pre
pared for something of which neither
reptile life nor the fishes nor the birds
and the four footed beasts could guess
what was to be the end. .When man
and woman appeared, created erect,
with their heads raised toward heaven
and not bowed to the earth, looking
downward, he was given the key. The
earth was given to man to work upon
and Improve. All other animal life
was given for man's use, each In its
way |to accomplish this great wor£
There Ib no beast or reptile or fish or
bird that has not either served man
kind or has found Itself exterminated
as being unfitted for the world It lived
In.
Oats For Feed Ingr.
Oats for feeding should have an
agreeable smell, clean, smooth and
bright appearance and pleasant taste,
should feel dry, hard and elastic to the
touch and when broken between the
teeth and should be fairly well sup
plied with flour, says The National
Stockman. The fact that they fulfill
these conditions will show that they
have been well saved, are sufficiently
old, possess a due amount of nutriment
and have not Buffered from injurious
Influences, such as damp and mold, as
would be evident If they were musty
in smell and dull in color. The pres
ence of dust In oats proves that they
have been badly saved and that their
quality has undergone more or less de
terioration. A shriveled up condition
is also a sign of inferiority. With a
plump variety of oats, if the grains feel
heavy in the hand, rattle more or less
like . shot when poured out, rebound
when they fall on wood or other hard
objects and show no tendency to stick
together, our good opinion of their nu
tritive value and sound condition will
be still further confirmed. The plump
er, more rounded and heavier oats are
the higher will be their market value.
Thinness of husk will also enhance the
price as a rule. The cost of white oats,
probably on account of their cleaner
and more pleasing appearance, is high
er than that of either black or tawny
oats. i2--'-J

$17,000,000 worth of cheese. The fig
ures prove that sound ethics are good
commerce. "Fraud results in loss of
trade. What we want to do is to pro
vide against counterfeits and gradual
ly regain our trade. The value of the
dairy products of the United States is
$800,000,000 a year. Wisconsin pro
duces $35,000,000 worth. When I was
governor, I received many letters from
chambers of commerce abroad, from
Bristol and Glasgow, inquiring into the
fraudulent cheese and butter we were
sending abroad. The dairy product of
the whole Pacific coast Is now going
across the Pacific to the countries of
the far east. Are we going by stupid
dishonesty to lose that market to Aus
tralia as we have nearly lost tbe Eng
lish market to Canada?"
Growing; Tnrnlps.
At a recent farmers' Institute In New
Brunswick one speaker told bow he
succeeded in growing 1,000 bushels per
acre. He took a poor piece of ground
in the fall, and after be had plowed it
he put on 80 tons of manure to the acre
and harrowed It In. He wants no ma
nure plowed In unless It is to be plow
ed up again In the spring, harrowed
lightly and furrowed two feet apart
about two Inches deep. In the fur
rows, he strewed 250 pounds of super
phosphate to the acre. He uses two
pounds of specially selected turnip
seed to the acre. When they are two
Inches high, he thins them to IS inches
apart After this he keeps the. horse
cultivator running two or three times
a week between the rows. As he
grows them principally as a succulent
winter food for his stock, he sows
early, that they may have time to
grow.
Consciousness Daring; Anaesthesia.
M. Philippe contributes an Interest-
Ing article to Le Revue Philosophique
entitled "La Conscience dans l'Anes
thesle Culrurgicale" (consciousness
during surgical anaesthesia). In this
article the author says that the evi
dence of both patients and surgical
operators goes to prove that under the
Influence of anaesthetics the patient
does not lose his consciousness. In
many cases also he suffers pain, but on
waking he has no recollection of his
•xperiences.
LOOKING INTO A SHOTGUN.
A Bandit's Victim Tells How It Feels
to Be Held Up.
"I happen to know how It feels to be
held up," said a gentleman who now;
occupies a position of prominence In lo
cal railroad . circles. "I acquired my
experience as a passenger In a stage
coach about six miles from Tombstone,
A. T., in 1884. . We bad a big load, six
men inside, two on the. driver's seat
and an express messenger oo the boot.
Every man in the crowd had a revolv
er, two of the Inside passengers had
Winchesters across their knees, and
the messengrt- had an 8 bore dnck
gun that contained nearly a quart of
slugs. We were held up at about 4ln
the afternoon by a single masked man,
who rose suddenly from behind a pile
of rocks and covered us with a 'sawed
off shotgun. All the curtains were
raised, so there was a fair view of the
interior, and when he yelled 'Hands
up!' everybody obeyed.
"Then he told us to get out one by
one and stand In a row, with our backs
to him. ' I never hated to do anything
so badly in my life, but I saw the oth
ers going and followed '•' suit'; About
that time a half grown boy, apparently
unarmed, appeared from behind the
rocks and took up the collection, which
included our joint arsenal. After that
we were ordered back, and the chief
bandit told the driver to go ahead/ •
"As far as I know, the robbers were
never caught, but what especially Im
pressed me about the episode was the
reluctance of any of our party to take
the Initiative. I was certain the slight
est resistance would be successful, but
I realized also that the man who made
the first move had an excellent chance
of being killed, and I suppose all the
others felt the same way. Anyhow, It
happened exactly as 1 have narrated
It. During the year I lived In Arizona
there were eight or nine hold ups on
the same road, and In no Instance was
there any resistance whatever. That
taught me that a crowd of average
men. gazing Into a cocked shotgun,
will do just about anything that. ls

COMPANY DINNERS.
They Are Dreaded by Guests and
Make tke Hostess Nervous.
Writing on "Making Company of
Guests," Edward Bok, in The Ladles'
Home Journal, considers "It a curious
fact that American housewives are so
loath to believe that a dinner with fuss
and \ feathers is dreaded by the vast
majority of people. The highest com
pliment we can possibly show a guest
at dinner is to let him partake of an
ordinary meal, to let him come quietly
in and 'be one of the family,' yet this
Is the very compliment which we with
hold from him. Instead of giving a
guest what he would relish most we
give him what he really enjoys least.
"Let a hostess be ever so graceful
and tactful, let there be years of ex
perience on her shoulders, yet nothing
can conceal from her guests that the
dinner which she Is serving Is other
than an unusual one. It is a formal af
fair, and no amount of grace can make
anything else of it, for nothing speaks
so lo.udly or so unerringly as a formal
company dinner. Every course shows
it; every movement of the waitress pro
claims it; every piece of china fairly
cries out the occasion.
"And of course no one at the table
really enjoys it The guest certainly
does not, because he knows he is being
made company of, and that feeling Is
always enough to offset every enjoy
ment. The hostess does not, for she
hasn't the time. Her eyes are for the
table and her servants, not for her
guest" N':: : *'
Knaigro Eamci Lost His Wager.
Miss Emma Eames has a brother,
Harold, who was an ensign In the
United States navy. His ship was sta
tioned at Leghorn, and one day the
flagship entered the harbor with the
fleet commander on board. The latter
was very dignified and was never
known to lose his self controL . One
day the commander was In swimming,
and young Eames made a friendly wa
ger with a fellow officer that he would
destroy bis senior's equanimity, In
naval parlance, "rattle" him. The wa
ger was accepted, and a moment after
ward Eames was In the water swim
ming toward his superior officer. Sud
denly he paused, and, stopping his
powerful overhand stroke, began tread-
Ing water. Then he saluted precisely
as if he had been on a quarter deck.
To the young man's Intense surprise
the commander returned the salute
with equal gravity. Mr. Eames lost
his wager.— Saturday Evening Post.

ACTIVITY IN MINING
There is more activity all along the mother lode in this
: county than for many years previous. It has been demon
strated beyond cavil by the Kennedy M. and;M. Company,
-under- ; the efficient management of Supt. J. F. Parks, that
deep mining will pay in this district, and in future but little
if any "gophering" will be done here. To be sure deep min
ing requires large capital, but that will be forthcoming in
time. In fact, the success of the Oneida alone will doubtless
bring, hundreds of thousands, if not several millions, of
working capital into this district.
Hon. F. X. Schoonmaker, the gifted lecturer aud
newspaper man of Plainsfield, New Jersey, delivered one of
his seven lectures on China, "China, the Shadow of the
World," at Love's Hall, Tuesday evening, reference to which
appears in our local columns. The following day Mr.
Schoonmaker accorded the editor of the LEDGER an interview
during which he entered freely into the discussion of the Chi
nese people, referring eloquently to their past, present and
probable future history. Mr. Schoonmaker is a power on
the rostrum and glows throughout his lecture with forensic
scintillations— electrifying all within the sound of his voice,
but to be heard to best advantage a private interview, is neces-
s ary. He is full and bubbling over with valuable informa
tion, and his ability to effectually impart it is marvelous.
His newspaper experience enables him to " boil down " what
he has to say until it comes from his well stored mind de
nuded of all" superfluities. One gets the pure wheat, every
kernel a gem of truth, and hence has to do no winnowing
himself. The listener's effort is simply to receive and store
away for future use, Mr. Schoonmaker doing the sifting as
he goes along. We are under great obligation to the dis
tinguished gentleman for valuable data for future use.
President McKinley's willingness. to subordinate his
personal opinion when it doesn't agree with that of the com
bined leaders of the party in Congress, is one of the reasons
why he is more popular in Congress than any . other Presi
dent has ever been. A case in point is the Porto Rican tariff
bill, which Chairman Payne, of the Ways and Means Com
mittee, called up in the House Feb. 19th and which will be
kept before the House until it is passed. President McKin
ley's opinion, as stated in his annual message, was that Porto
Rico should have free trade with us, but when the party
leaders in Congress concluded that it was best to put a small
duty — one-fourth of what foreign countries pay — on Porto
Rican products, he at once stated that he would not attempt
to place his personal opinion above that of Congress, but
weuld sign any bill passed by Congress. The principal ob
ject of the duty is to raise money to be spent for the better
ment of Porto Rico.
At the fourth annual banquet of the West Virginia
Republican Association, Representative Pearre, of Maryland,
who spoke to the toast, "President McKihley — one good term

ticket; also when he said that Win. McKinley was the great

S. P. RELIEF. DEPARTMENT.
WUI Be Established For the Welfare of
Bailroad Employes.
The following circular" lotter just
Issued by President C. P. Huntington
fully explains the plan, its benefits, etc. :
Southern Pacific Company, Executive
Office 23 Broad street, New York, Feb
ruary 15, 1900 —On March 1, 1900, a
department of the company's service,
to be known as the Relief Department,
was established and placed in the ex
ecutive charge of Mr. A. F. Hess, as
Superintendent, . with headquarters at
San Francisco, Cal., whose directions
in carrying out its regulations are to be
complied with, subject to the control of
an Advisory Committee composed of
representatives of the employes and of
the company.
The object of this department is the
establishment and management of a
fund, to bo known as the Relief Fund,
for the payments of definite amounts
to contributing employes who, under
the regulations, shall be entitled to re
lief when they are disabled by accident
or sickness, and, in the event of death,
to the relatives or other beneficiaries
specified in their applications.
The Relief Fund from which the pro
posed benefits are to be paid will be
formed by voluntary contributions
from employes, Income or profit de
rived from investment of money in the
fund, and by the payment of $36,000
per annum by the Southern Pacific
Company, which thereby, in inaugur
ating the department, Insures it from
the beginning revenues equivalent to
the interest at current rates, on nearly
$1,000,000. (
Membership is to be voluntary and
without medical examination as to all
employes now in the service, enabling
all, regardless of age or physical con
dition, to avail themselves of the ben
efits of the department; but, as most
of the expense of operation will be for
the payment of sick and death benefits,
it is obvious that the privilege of join
ing without medical examination must
bo limited as to time. After the lapse
of a reasonable delay, thereforo, mem
bership will be dependent on age and
a satisfactory medical examination.
Applicant!! for employment after
March 1, 1900, must become members
of the Relief Department before enter
ing the company's service. ■ ,
The General Manager, who shall be
ex otticio a member and Chairman of
the Advisory Committo, will prepare
circulars explaining to employes the
rules, regulations and objects of the
department, and will take steps, under
instructions from the President, to or
ganize the working staff, receive appli
cations for membership, and, in gen
eral, to inaugurate the operations of
tho department.

The property bonded by the above

Peerless— Jackson.
Superintendent Henry Osborne con
tinues to find the "ear marks" he is
looking for. and is therefore, very
sanguine that he ts In the right locality
to find the main ledgo of the Mother
Lode. Mr. Osborno is not by any
means alone in his opinion. Many
other mining men of great experience
and note agree with him entirely,
among them, Mr. Henry Eudey, at
present President of the Bank of Ama
dor County and Secretary of the Ar
gonaut Mining Company, but who has
been engaged in the practical work of
mining nearly all his life. Mr. Eudoy
emphatically states that, in his opinion,
founded on close and careful observa
tion, the main ledge runs through the
Peerless property. Yesterday, Supt.
Osborne found sufficient evidence to
convince him that he has the true
fissure vein. "
Options Secured.
I Since the excellent indications at the
■Peerless mine were discovered, all
■ground north and south of the Badar-
Kcco ranch that could be secured has
■been bonded by local parties. A bond
Ion the Kirk wood and one on the Bellu
hmiDi tract, we are creditably informed,
Bwas secured last week. The Peerless
Krold Mine and Improvement Company
Bias proved to be a pioneer in this new
Section, and the development is being
Itnxiously watched by this entire min
ing community; and, without putting it
Boo strong, if the Peerless mine proves
Ho be what Superintendent Osbornean-
Bici pates, it will open up a district here-
Hofore unprospected, that will add
Hnuch to the wealth of this mining dia-
Hrict and double the population of Jack-
It' l Has The Banner Mine.
I John R. Phillips, superintendent of
.mador Queen No. 2, of this mining
Lstrict, has bonded the old Banner
line near Nevada City for $60,000, the
ond to run two years. The Banner
as produced la its day a large amount
of good ore. and is considered by Mr.
Phillips and his associates a valuable
piece of mining property. Mr. Phillips
informed a Ledger '-representative
that he was offered $10,000 for the bond
a few weeks after ho had obtained it.
The holders of the bond have incorpor
ated a company and will issue 150,000
shares of stock, par value $1.00 a share.
The stock books are now open. The
many friends of Mr. Phillips in this
camp wish him and his associates un
bounded success. .
CALAVERAS COUNTY.
Citizen: Affairs at the Ford mine
seem to be progressing favorably.
The assessments are being met on
time and the treasury is ample, reach
ing nearly $12,000. Mr. Gutmann ex
amined the mine on Wednesday and
expressed himself perfectly satisfied
with the outlook, and outlined the
work for the immediate future.
At the Sheep ' Ranch mine every
thing is going forward swimmingly and
the most sanguine views are held for
the first clean-up of the new mil], now
in successful operation.
D. Gutmann, the promotor of local
mining schemes and of the Amador
railroad enterprise, has spent the
week in Calaveras county, devoting his
attention mainly, to the Sheep Ranch
mine, and the" Ford, with both of
which he expresses himself perfectly
satisfied.
J. A. Greeuwood and Alex Questo,
formerly of the Gwin mine, have taken
an option on the south extension of the
California Copper mine, located on the
Daulton ranch, in Madora county, and
they think they have a good piece of
property.
T. E. McSorley, superintendent of a
quartz claim on French hill, near the
town of Mokelumne Hill, for a Mil
waukee company, U driving a tunnel to
tap numerous quartz veins on the
property of the company, and is now
in' 350 feet. Good results are expected
when the tunnel is finished. **.-•;
The four-stamp mill on the Oro Fino
mine, near Cave City, is now approach
ing completion and will be started to
crushing as soon as finished. Water
power Is to be used. W. B. Swank is
doing the work.
J. E. Barton, representing Milwau
kee capitalists, is working the Green
Mountain noar Mokelumne Hill, with a
small force And good 'results and is
making little noise about it. He has a
water supply of 500 inches. ' '\. \.V
The Boston Hill mine located near
Cave City, which has a history as an
early producer was pjfamined by J. S.
White, the mining expert, for a syndi
cate of San Francisco -capitalists, last
week and bonded to Ed Rigney of the
Emery mine. Hughey Gallagher
worked this mine in the early days by
Long Tom and rocker with excellent
results. It finally passed into the
honds of Tom Martin, the slayer of
Nicholas Mason, now serving a life
term in San Quentin, who deeded it to
Mrs. G. Day of Sheep Ranch. It has
been worked as a placer, but will
be operated as p. hydraulic mine
by the bonders. This deal is consid
ered important, as it promises to de
velop the rich section about Cave City.
The transfer of the Golden Gate (the
old Flamm) mine, which will be found
noted in the county records elsewhere
published, bimply means the formal
transfer of the property now known as
the Commodore to the newly organized
Commodore Gold Mining Company.
The stockholders' interests remain the
same, however, no new holders having
been added. The condition of the
mine is most promising. Under Su
perintendent Clary's direction the
ledge has been exploited for a distance
of 200 feet, and It will be again cross
cutted the last time at 150 feet on the
drift on the 300-foot level and was then
twenty-six feet wide, assaying to the
satisfaction *of the management.
There is every indication that the
character of the ore has held its own.
The future of the mine will depend
somewhat on what the vein will show
at this point for milling purposes.
The hoisting works are about com
pleted on the hill above the tunnel at
the Lucas mine and the shaft is being
sunk with all possible haste.
The Melones Company at Robipsons
Ferry will hold a special meeting on
the 7th of March next to consider the
proposition of increasing, the capital
stock, by fin issue of 85,000 shares of
preferred stock, to $2,350,000, the new
stock to be entitled to 12 per cent divi
dends and to be sold at the par price of
$10 per share. . ; .
Chronicle: We were shown speci
mens Tuesdny last by Mr. L. VandeU
that were taken from French Hill, near
this place. Mr. -VandeU was engaged
in running a cut into the hill on the old
Hollaway place, where the specimens
were found. As they were all quartz
gold Mr. Vandell has concluded to
operate on a more extended scale to see
if he cannot find the lead from which
they came. He has bonded a tract of
land from Mrs. S. C. Peek and will at
once commence a tunnel lower down
and see if the lead cannot be found.
French Hill is ribbed from one end to
the other with small strings of quartz
running parallel with each other and
all making into the hill. There is evi
dently a lead of mammoth dimensions
somewhere in the hill, although it may
be of great depth. But there is just
this much about it, the one who is
lucky enough to find it will become a
Rothschild in a very short time.
The Plymouth Rock mine, three
miles from Milton, formerly owned and
operated by Tom T. Lane, has again
started up, after a two years' period of
inactivity, under a new management.
An 18-foot bank of gravel was struck
in the North Star mine this week.
The gravel is said to be exceedingly
rich.

situated just hack of the Golden Rule
Store, in Stent, and ha« a shaft on It
100 feet deep, which is situated on the
same lead as the Jumper mine. It will,
no doubt, be as good as thft latter as
soon as it is put down deeper.
A new WUfly concentrator was haul
ed to the San Justo mine Wednesday.
It is said that this company will put up
more stamps and other machinery In a
very short time.
Work In the mines has been rather
quiet about here for the past week,
nothing of consequence going on. It is
reported that one sale was made, that
of the Romaggi mine, to an English
syndicate for $5000 spot cash; while the
transfer papers are eaid to have been
made out and tbe money paid, no good
authority can be given for it. Also
that that the same company is trying
to get the Lewis Graham mine. These
two mines are between the St. Law
rence and the Harris mines, and is con
sidered very good property..
The Bennett'Leeper mill started up
again this week.
George Gardner and Bennett started
this week to work a lot of tailings at

$210 per ton. They have abouftwenty
to thirty tons.

Mother Lode: Tom O'Brien, after a
prospecting trip up the river, displayed
some exceedingly rich rock In town last
week. Tom, however, is quite a josher,

not advise you to give up the Klondyke
or Cape Nome to follow bis tips.
At the Clio mine the crosscut at the
125-foot level is expected to cut the
vein in about ten days. It is under
stood that this prospect is fulfilling the
most sanguine predictions. Under the
business-like direction of Manager Pot
tor and intelligent foremanship of T.
W. Webb the Clio bids fair to beepme
au early producer.
New Era: We regret to say that
there is a disagreement among the
owners of the Draper mine, and as
there is no apparent disposition of an
agreeable settlement, it is likely that
the mine will snspend operations. L.
H. Bartlett, tho president, is out from
Boston for the purpose of adjusting the
affair if possible The financial condi
tion of the company is strong and the
mine a good one, and the reason for
the disorder cannot ever be surmised.
One of the most promising claims on
the Mother Lode Is undoubtedly that
of the Woodslde brothers, located on
their ranch near Algerine. Upon the
mine in refereaoe is a shaft only about
twenty feet deep, from which already
over one thousand dollars has been
taken out. Mr. Woodside showed us
a specimen piece about as large as a
small" apple that contained at least
twenty dollars in f reo gpld, and he says
the croppings can be readily traced
several hundred feet and show free gold
the entire length. Mr. Woodside dis
continued wprk when he made the rich
strike at the bottom pf the shaft as
parties wore negotiating for its pur
chase.
The force at the Poison Oak, near
here, has been considerably increased
and development work Is being earn

Hawkins Receives Serious In
juries From a Saw.
t
J. A. Butterfield's Death.
Between nine and ten o'clock last
Wednesday night, February 28, John
Alfred Butterfield, one of the pioneers
and prominent citizens of Amador
county breathed his last at his resi
dence on Broadway in this city. His
death was very sudden, caused by a
stroke of paralysis— the third one, we
believe.
Deceased came to this county in an
early day and engaged in various lines
of business, including the lumber busi
ness, he at one time owning the mills at
Antelope, now the : property of F^JMf,
Whitmore.'
He served a term" as County Treas
urer many years ago.
If he had lived until the fifth day of
this month be would have been 72
years of age.
He was born In Now Hampshire,
and, soon after coming to ' this state,
joined the Volcano I. O. O. F. Lodge
of which organization be was a mem
ber in good standing at tbe time of his
death. He was also a member of the
Chosen Friends of Jackson.
He leaves a widow and a daughter,
Mrs. John Barton, of Antelope, to
mourn bis loss. He was highly re
spected by all who knew him.
The funeral took place from his late
residence, under the auspices of the
I. O. O. F. Lodge of Jackson, and the
Order of Chosen Friends, this after
noon at 2 o'clock.
A DREADFUL ACCIDENT.
An Eight-Tear-Old Lad Receives Serious In-
juries from a Saw-
About 3:30 last Wednesday afternoon
a horrifying accident occurred at the
saw mill of the Zella Mining Company.
A number of children were playing
"hide-and-go-seek" in and about the
mill, which was not in operation just
at that time. One of the little boys,
Vernon Hawkins, aged about nine
years, spn pf S. H. Hawkins of the Cen
tral Hptel, secreted himself under the
box or trough, which was partially
filled with shavings, In whioh a circu
lar saw operates when the power is
turned on. He was snugling down
there in great glee, no doubt thinking
he had successfully eluded the eyes of
his play-mate, when the sawyer, not
dreaming of the boy's presenco under
the saw-trpugh, turned the power on.
When the saw started, although not at
ful| speed, fpr in that case the boy
would have been killed in getting. out,
it frightened the lad and he scrambled
out, receiving an Injury which may
cost him his life. He was, however,
throe inches from the saw and If he had
remained quiet would not have been
hurt. The' boy was conveyed to his
hpme q,rul Pr, Eudicott summoned, he
in turn calling Dr. Gall In counsel.
An examination disclosed a flesh wound
across the the small of the back and a
dreadful incision in the hip region, cut
ting the large sciatic nerve and the
main muscles of tho back of the thigh,
and the bpne half way thrpugh. If
the boy recovers he will prpbably be a
cripple for life.

Bchoonmaker's Lecture.
The first of the course of three lec
tures to be delivered hore under the
management of the Thomas Lyceum
Bureau, of San Francisco, was deliv
ered by Hon. F. X. Schoonmaker, of
Plainstield, New Jersey, last Tuesday
evening.
Thesubject was "China, The Shadow
of the World," and for two hours and
fifteen minutes the learned gentleman
furnished palatable Intellectual food for
his large audience. Those who were
present did eat and were filled. The
absent ones will never know bow much
they missed. The lecture was fully up
to expectations, which were on stilts.
Mr. Schoonmaker is a good thinker
and a fluent talker. The people of
Jackson were well pleased and hope to
hear him again some time.
A pleasant feature of the evening
was the graceful introduction of the
scholar by Senator John F. Davit).

The Ledger regrets that its request

mention, the same as those whose

An Improvement.
Richard Webb, the owner of the New
National Hotel building, has put in a
hood for the kitchen range and an out
side galvanized iron flue. This is a
great Improvement because it not only
does away with the odor of cooking,
but conveys the heat from the range to
the outside, while heretofore it went
up the inside flue, thus overheating two
good rooms in the house which in the
summer season were practically useless.

SHE WOULD NOT MARRY
Advertised For a Husband,
But None Suited.
MRS. BROUHARD HAD SEVERAL APPLICANTS
Martha £. Brouhard Wanted the
Coin and Her Advertisements
Were Effective.
Madam Brouhard, according to the
following report taken from the San
Francisco Chronicle, has duped several
men who were evidently hankering for
the ' 'flesh pots of Egypt. " Several
men were fleeced out of various sums of
money, but they did not squeal. . It
remained for James W. Leeper of San
Francisco, who was touched off by the
smoothe widow to the tune of $550 in
cold coin,, not to mention the bone and
sinew he expended on the barren tun
nel, to raise a howl, which landed the
dame in Court.
Amador county being mentioned as
the scene : of ..some. of the fair widow's
mining schemes, the, Ledger "decided
to look up the records and see what
property the Bronhard really owned
in Amador county. > While thus en
gaged, the -following deeds - were sent
here for record and appeared in the
Ledger's columns of county affairs on
February 16th:
M. E. Brouhard to Thomas Hirst
ten one-thousands interest in Davis
quartz mine: $200.
M. E. Brouhard to Thomas Hirst
three one-thousands interest in Davis
quartz mine; $100.
The deeds were recorded.
The Davis mine is a quartz claim lo
cated in township seven, section one
north, range twelve east, In Robert
son mining district. The claim was lo
cated by J. J. Mitchell. The Chroni
cle's report is as follows:
"Mrs Martha, E. Brouhard, known
also as Mrs. Martha E. Maxwell and
as Mrs. M. E. McManus, looked coldly
on her former admirers yesterday as
she sat In Police Judge Conlan's court
and listened to testimony bearing on
the charge of obtaining money and
goods by false pretenses made against
her by J. M. Leeper. Advertisements
in matrimonial papers telling of a
charming widow with a fortune in
mines and agricultural lands figured in
the case, and some of the self-acknowl
edged victims went on the stand and
told their love for the widow led them
to invest money in her schemes to trap
the unwary.
The defendant is about forty years
old, gaunt in face, and has cold, un
sympathetic eyes that show no signs of
power to win hearts, yet she has been
married two or three times and en
gaged so often, says the prosecution,
that it would require an able statistic
ian to compute the exact number of
her promised husbands. Her bait for
would-be benedicts was the following
advertisement, which she bad Inserted
in several papers conducted by matri
monial bureaus:
A nice-looking, respectable widow,
no children, has large real estate and
mining property, owns also a fine
country home a short distance from
Sacramento, wishes to become ac
quainted with an honest workingman;
all letters answered ; intention, matri
mony.
J. F. Mello, a miner who lives near
Volcano, Amador county, was the first
witness. He had worked on what she
called her mining property, he said,
and two weeks' labor yielded just $5 in
gold. 'I don't call that mining prop
erty, ' the witness replied disgustedly to
a question asked by the defendant's
attorney. . ■
George Hoff meister, County Assessor
of El Dorado county, said that in El
Dorado county a woman named Mrs.
M. E. McManus owned 160 acres, val
ued at $250. At this the defendant ad
mitted that McManus was a name that
she had received from one of her hus
bands.
A. D. Witt of Sacramento was the
next witness. He saw the defendant's
advertisement in "Cupid's Column," a
matrimonial paper published in Deane,
Minn., and after a few months- of cor
respondence he came all the way from
Minnesota to California to marry her.
She induced him to" part with $250, he
said. He was to receive a quarter in
terest in twenty acres of mining land
in El Dorado county, but after working

dled. He wanted to marry her, but
he had no more money to invest and
she refused him. -
D. W. Norman of Sacramento also
worked in the pining tunnel. He in
vested $50, but it was represented by a
check, and he grew auspicious in time
to save it by instructing his banker to
refuse payment.
J. M. Leeper, tho complaining .wit
ness, told of being attracted by the de
fendant's advertisement in Wedding
Bells a matrimonial paper published
in this city. He had a lodging-house
at 218 Eddy street, but he gave her a
bill of sale of the property in exchange
for her promise that she would pay
him $50 cash and $450 in mining stock.
She told him that she had 200 men em
ployed at her mine. She declined to
marry him and returned to Sacra
mento. Leeper informed the police of
her schemes, and she was arrested in
Sacramento by Detectives ODea and
and Ryan of this city.
Mrs. Mary-Henderson testified to
buying the lodging-house from Mrs.
Brouhard for $550. At this juncture
the prosecution called a halt for the
day, and the case was continued until
this morning,
Thomas Hirst, a resident of Oak
land, who, it is said, Invested $600 in
the Brouhard mining and matrimonial
venture, failed to appear as a witness
yesterday, and a bench warrant was
issued for his arrest."

Hoit Mental Snß-sestlons Mar Be
' . '- Made to Combat Diaeaae. ;
If an individual has faith in a medi
cine or in a treatment, he will assured
ly derive more benefit from the medi
cine or. treatment than if he were
skeptical as. to its merits, says The
Medical Record. There can be little
doubt that the sympathetic physician
is the one best calculated to lead his
patient to recovery. Again, In many
diseases the good that may be wrought
to the sufferer by the agency of mental
suggestion is undeniable. Professor
J. M. Baldwin, 'referring to this fact In
connection with insomnia, says:
"In experimenting upon the possibili
ty' of ' suggesting sleep to another , I
have found certain strong reactive, in
fluences upon my own mental condi
tion. Such an effort which ' Involves
the picturing of another as asleep is a
strong auto-suggestion of sleep, taking
effect in my own case In about five
minutes if the conditions be kept con
stant. The more clearly the patient's
sleep is pictured the stronger becomes
the subjective feeling of drowsiness.
An unfailing cure for insomnia, speak
ing for myself, is the persistent effort
to put some one else asleep by hard
thinking, of the end In view, with a
continued gentle movement, such as
stroking the other with the hand." :
Dr. B. C. Spltzka of New York has
recently ; given some really remarka
ble Instances of the power of mental
suggestion. Etc cites the well known
fact that the mortality from wounds
and diseases In a defeated army com
pared with a victorious army Is. as 4
to 3 and even 3to 2. He also refers
to the Incontrovertible fact that . per-
sons in robust health have been known
to die apparently of starvation after
being without food for from .three to
five days. Dr. Spltzka is of the opin
ion that these individuals did not die
of actual starvation, but from the
physical effects of the hunger. The
. proof of this contention lies In the fact
that persons have been known to fast
of their free will for more • than 40
days without Injuring their constitu
tions to any appreciable extent.
Many examples establishing the truth
of this statement might be given, but it
will be sufficient to quote one from Dr.
Spitzka's paper. ' He says:
"In the graver form of hysteria,
when loss of sensation occurs In ex
actly one-half of the body, you can lay
' a piece of tinted paper on the sensitive
side, then suggesting it to be a mustard
. plaster a red area will appear on the
corresponding unsensitive side. Blis
ters of such a character that scars
■ have permanently remained from them
have been produced in similar cases by
the same method." \ . j
The I medical profession, it appears
- more than likely, has not as yet wholly
the advantages to be de
rived from the employment' of mental
. suggestion.
Comb and Scissors' Combined.
A new hah? cutting implement, com
bining the comb and scissors, is for the
convenience of the barber, and it is
claimed for this tool that it greatly fa-^
cilitates the operation of cutting or
trimming the hair and f urthermore
cannot pull the hair, as do frequently
NEW TOOL FOR BARBERS.
the scissors and the clippers which it
displaces. This device includes in its
construction a pair of scissors, the low
er blade being provided with a comb
which in operation is next to the head.
By its use the thorough distribution of
the hair strands over the cutting edge
is assured and the hah? evenly cut. To
sharpen or clean the blade it is simply
necessary to detach a screw and swing
the comb outward the proper distance
so as to easily reach the blade with a
whetstone or the like.
Healthful lan.
The 'American Academy of Railway
Surgeons is moving in the direction of
making railroad cars more healthful.
It long has been felt by. tne profession
that refqrmj in "the hygiene of railway
travel' is' imperatively needed, and the
new movement promises to be both ac
tive and effective. It is .shown that the
material -used in furnishing railway
coaches— plushes and velvet cushions,
woolens and draperies of every kind—
afford the best possible nest for the
protection and preservation of germs,
and they are also the most difficult to
clean. It is now recommended that
cars be finished and furnished with a
smooth surfaced material, like, hard
wood or leather, which, while capable
of being quickly cleaned, will lend it
self, to the most tasteful arrangement.
Not only should plush, velvet and dra
pery be almost entirely done away
with, but there should be less emboss
ing and carving in the ornamentation
of the cars. The tendency in this coun
try in the matter of decoration is to ex
travagance, and in railway cars this
overelaboratlon greatly increases the
Labor of keeping the cars clean.
The Fox.
Everybody knows that a fox's tall Is
in hunting parlance his brush, but few
perhaps know further that his scalp Is
technically a "mask," or, if he is su
perlatively game, it Is torn off. nailed
on the kennel door of the pack in at bis
death and marked with . three crosses
to show that he died only at the end
of a ringing n*. The brush, of course,
goes to whoever is nearest when it Is
taken. ' The trophy nest In value Is the
right forefoot— in hunting phrase, "pad
thief." The left fo*refoot, "pad lnino,"
ranks next; after it. the hind feet,
"the pegs, which only very young or
very avid hunters care much to claim.
One amazing thing regarding the
vixen— the she fox — is that no dog will
follow her trail' while she carries
young. . It is uncertain whether she
then leaves no scent or whether the
dogs obey some primal instinct In
passing over her track. A certain con
sideration for the female is apparent in
most of the canine species. One of the
surest signs of rabies is for a dog to
attack a female of his own Bpecies,
AMERICAN DIAMONDS,
. —
, Studies by the Geological Survey of
Canada.
: The dissemination of information re
garding the lake diamonds through the
region of the moraine, says Popular
Science Monthly, should serve the two
fold purpose of encouraging search for
the buried stones and of discovering
diamonds in the little collections of
"lucky stones" and local curios which
accumulate on the clock shelves of
country farmhouses. When it is con
sidered that three of the largest dia
monds thus far found In the. region re
mained for periods of 7, 8 and 1G years
respectively in the hands of the farm-
Ing population, it can hardly be doubt
ed that many other diamonds' have
been found and preserved as local cu
riosities without their "real nature be
ing discovered. ■' : ' .
If diamonds should be discovered in
the moraines of eastern Ohio, of \vest-.
em Pennsylvania or of western New
York, considerable light would thereby
be thrown unon the problem of locat
ing the ancestral borne. More impor
tant than this, however, Is the mapping
of the Canadian wilderness to the
southeastward and eastward of James
bay hi order to determine the direction
of ice movement within the region, so
that the tracking of the stones already
found may be carried nearer their
home. The director of the geological
survey of Canada is giving attention to
this matter and has also suggested that
a study be made of the material found
in association with diamonds in the
moraine, so that If possible its source
may be discovered.
With the discovery of new localities
of these emigrant stones and the col
lection of data regarding the move
ment of the Ice over Canadian territo
ry It will perhaps be possible the more
accurately and definitely .to circum
scribe their home country and as its
boundaries are drawn closer and closer
to pay this popular jewel a visit In its
ancestral home, there to learn what we
so much desire to know regarding its
genesis and its life history.
Should foal Give Out?
What then? Are we utterly depend
ent upon coal, so that the wheels of in
dustry will stop and the forests be con
sumed for fuel when coal gives out?
Of course not. It is an idle fear. Al
ready we have the beginnings of a
new method of utilizing natural energy
which will prove enormously more ef
fective than coal ever has been and
will be practically inexhaustible to
whatever extent industry may expand.
Electrical energy developed by water
power will run the world's industries,
furnish its light and heat and be the
universal substitute for all forms of
combustion methods. Water power is
practically unlimited, and it will be
utilized more and more In proportion
as the need for it arises and as its use
becomes at different places aud .it suc
cessive periods cheaper than coal. The
substitution will proceed gradually'un
til, when the coal supply finally is ex
hausted, nobody will have anything
more than a curious or academic Inter
est in the matter, and probably not a
ripple will be produced in the steady
onward flow of the world's industry.
As. the use of water power to develop
electrical energy Increases to the point
of formidable competition with - coal
electrical students and Inventors will
doubtless bring out improvements mak
ing it possible to store the power or
conduct It long distances at small cost,
until our factories, railroads and ships
can be operated by it, our houses light
ed and warmed and food prepared, all
at even less expense than is possible
today with coal. — Gunton's Magazine.
