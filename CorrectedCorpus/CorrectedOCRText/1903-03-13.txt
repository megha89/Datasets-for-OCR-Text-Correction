THE QUEEN OF SPICES
CINNAMON, ELICIOUS AN SUGARY
AROMATIC ANP PUNGENT
The Ucorery of Its Valuable Prop
crtles Antedates Recorded History
Something of It* Uses and the Way
In Which It Ia Produced
Cinnamon is in itself unquestionably
the most delicious of all spices, being
sugary as well as aromatic and pun
gent. Many thousands of pounds are
consumed annually in eery ciilized
country, and it Is also highly appreci
ated by een semlciilized and bar
barous nations where culinary art and
medicine hae as yet made little prog
ress
Its uses In sweet cookery are innu
merable There are ery few fruits
which are not Improed In preseres,
pickles and pastries by the addition of
more or less of this delicate bark It Is
an essential flaoring in all spice cakes
and In many arieties of pies and pud
dings  In chocolate, confectionery,
candles, cordials and liqueurs cinnamon
contributes an Incomparable flaor
Its medicinal alue is well known
as an antlepasmodic and carminatie
and tonic Its use Is recommended as
a preentie and remedy for cholera,
and In seasons when stomach troubles
preail cinnamon drops are recom
mended as the most wholesome form
of candy for children
The discoery of the aluable prop
erties of cinnamon antedates recorded
history, as It is mentioned in the Bible,
in the book of Exodus, as one of the
ingredients of the sacred oil with
which the priests were anointed So
highly was the sweet bark esteemed
by the ancients that een a small piece
was considered a fit gift for a king It
Is always mentioned as, an especially
choice substance by Greek writers pre
ious to the Christian era It Is said
that the Arab traders, who first
brought it to Egypt and western Asia,
surrounded its history and production
with special tales of mystery, and
magic
The clnnnamon tree Is a member of
the laurel family, which In the tropics
Is represented by a large number of
aromatic and medicinal trees and
shrubs
There are seeral closely allied cin
namon trees, but the finest bark is pro
cured from a species natie to the is
land of Ceylou, distinguished by bota
nists as Cinimmonium zeylanicum In
a state of nature this grows to be a
tree from twenty to thirty feet in
height with rather large, oal, entire
margined leaes and yellowish flowers
succeeded by small, brown drupes re
sembling acorns In shape The grayish
brown bark is internally of an orange
color, which changes upon drying to
the characteristic brown which is the
recognized name of a particular shade
Almost eery part of the tree yields
some choice substance and Is especial
ly rich In oil The roots yield camphor
and' the leaes an oil resembling the
oil of cloes and often substituted for
it while from the fruit a substance
called cinnamon suet is manufactured,
which Is highly fragrant and from
which in former times candles for the
exclusie use of the king were made
In the latter part of the eighteenth
century, wliile England was for a time
In possession of the spice Islands, cin
namon plants were among the choice
products that were imported Into ari
ous other tropical regions, including
the West Indies, where in Cuba and
seeral other islands It has become a
considerable article of commerce Un
der cultiation It is not allowed to
grow into a tree, as the richest bark ia
taken from shoots of from two to four
years' growth The young tree Is,
therefore, cut and shoots from the root
are encouraged to grow The majority
of these are cut when about ten feet in
height and the bark Is detached in ten
or twele inch lengths After lying in
bundles for a few days the bark 13
scraped by hand, both outside and In,
until reduced to a thin sheet These
sheets arc then made up into compos
ite "quills" by placing the narrower
and shorter pieces inside and rolling
tightly, forming flrmrods, which after
further drying are made into bundles
weighing about eighty pounds and
wrapped for shipping Grocers diide,
assort and j ery neatly combine por
tions of these quills into small packets
for the conenience of their customers
The oil of cinnamon Is made by
grinding the coarser pieces of the bark
and soaking them for two or three
days in sea water, followed by the
process of distilling Two oils, one
heaier and the other lighter than wa
ter, are the product both possessing
similar properties The color aries
from cherry red to pale yellow, tba
latter being preferred by most pur
chasers
The work of distilling is ligbt, and
an oil equal to the best Ceylonese is
now produced in Trinidad and arious
other localities in Cuba and other West
India islands
As cinnamon commands a good price
and Its uses are continually multiply
ing, there is eery inducement for ex
tending the area of its cultiation, both
in the eastern and western hemi
spheres—St Louis Republic
A Crisis Met Half Way
There were Btrlct orders in the Phil
ippines regarding looting, and one day
a lieutenant's suspicions were aroused
by a priate whom he saw peering ea
gerly under the piazza of a house on
the outskirts of Manila, writes ixie
Wolcott in Harper's Magazine
"What are you doing there?" he de
manded In his gruffest tones
"Why, sir ' said the soldier, saluting,
"I'm only trying to catch a chicken
which I'e Just bought"
Lieutenant K stooped and caught
sight of a fine pair of fowls
"There are two chickens under
there," he exclaimed excitedly "I
bought the other one Catch 'om both"

MENTAL TENSION
Bard to Realise the ifficulty ot
Keepina; a Natural Pose
We neer know how actie our im
aginations an be till we let them out
or till they get the better of us for
some reason   A major in the army
recently admitted that when he went
into action for the first time he was so
scared that he did not know which
way was north, but be had an oer
whelming desire to reach it, whereer
It was Yet, after six or eight battles
and after being wonPersonalPersonal J\l a couple of
times, he regarded battles ery much
as people hereabout regard the eening
fight at the Manhattan end of the
bridge, says the Brooklyn Eagle
 Cases of wanting to run when bullets
fly are by no means difficult to find
But a young soldier In Brooklyn con
fesses to n more queer experience His
regiment was in camp and had been
ordered out for dress parade, as usual
When lined up for inspection, eery
man as stiff _ as a ramrod and not a
white gloe moing, this young man,
'a lieutenant, began to ask himselfPersonal
"Suppose I should slip, or anything, to
break the quiet? Suppose I should
fall?" Tho idea of falling kept grow
ing In his mind till before the Inspec
tion was oer and the regiment was
allowed to use Its feet once more he
could hardly keep on his legs and was
in a great sweat of agony from the
dread of tumbling oer and making an
exhibition of himself
People who hae neer tried it do not
realize how hard it Is to stand abso
lutely still and yet appear interested
and at ease Artists' models succeed
nt it, especially those in Italy, and will
hold a pose not too difficult for an hour
Actors, when they group about the man
In the center of the stage, who is en
joying all the limelight— and how they;
hate them for it— are required to keep
still, so as not to distract attention from
the great man's sayings and motions,
and because they must group in such a
way as to form a picture and keep It
till It can be realized by the eyes in
front But this enforced statuesque
ness Is hard on the supes They are
not used to It When they are put un
der the strain, and when as Roman
warriors they must stand at the back
without winking while Brutus or Vir
ginius or some other ponderous person
unbosoms himself respecting loe  or
politics, they are In a small torture
One such last season who could no lon
ger abide it to listen to the soliloquy by
the head man pitched oer on his face
and had to be lugged out by the arms
to the spoiling of the scene
BabipN Neer Get Senaick
"Babies neer get seasick I hae
carried thousands of them In my time,"
said an American line steward, accord
ing to the Philadelphia Record, "and
In rough weatlier I hae seen their fa
thers, mothers, brothers and sisters
keel oer like soldiers before a cannon
ball; but not so with the babies
Whether It be rough or smooth at
sea, a baby_is alwnys ,nn excellent
sailor— rosy, Jolly and with the appe
tite of a horse ; o you know tne ex
planation of this singular fact? It is
ns simple as the fnet is strange Ba
bies don't get seasick because they are
accustomed to the rocking of the cra
dle That moement is"much like the
rocking of a ship A baby aboard ship,
therefore, is merely a baby In an un
usually big cradle, and there is nothing
odd to him about the rocking, for it is
what he has been accustomed to all
his life"

Rainwater Good if Yon Like It
"When a man gets used to drinking
rainwater," said a New Orleans man to
the Washington Post, "there is no other
water in the world that tastes so good
Most of the people In New Orleans
hae cisterns in their yards which hold
an abundant supply of water caught
from the clouds, the purest and best
in the world, according to my notion
The winter rainfall alone is used, the
summer catch not being desirable It
la somewhat curious that in northern
latitudes the cistern water does not
keep wholesome and sweet as it does
in our country"

LOST HIS NERVE
Wtr It Waa That Big Pete Failed to
Hit the Sheriff
There were thirty men in the White
Wolf saloon when the sheriff of Siler
connty sauntered in to arrest big Pete
Thompson for murder Pete was play
ing a hand in a game of poker, and
after nodding to him the sheriff stood
up at the bar and called for a drink
His back was scarcely turned when
Pete laid down his cards, pulled hls
gun and fired six shots as fast as his
fliger could pull the trigger Thesherifl
neer moed When the smoke bad
rolled out of the open door and we
could see, the sheriff stood in the same
position and wore the same smile One
bullet had burned his cheek; a second
had grazed his ear; a third had cut
through his shirt collar under the left
ear Big Pete was a dead shot, and
yet he had missed his man at fifteen
feet" 
•^t through, Pete?" asked the sher
iff, 'breaking a silence that was posi
tiely painful
"And you— you are not heeled!"
gasped Pete as his arm sunk slowly
down
"No; come on" '"
 "You didn't bring your guns?"
"No; if you are through shooting,
we'll go"
Pete laid his two guns down on the
table before him and walked to the
door and out into the street.  His horse
was tied to a post a block away He
reached the horse, mounted and then
headed down the long street after the
sheriff, who was giing him not the
slightest attention In fie minutes the
pair were out of sight
"What ailed Pete?" was asked of
the barkeeper, who had come to the
door of the saloon
"Lost his nere," he brusquely re
plied  
"How do you mean?"
"Why, the sheriff coming without a
gun and standing there to be shot at
took all his sand away and made a wo
man of him"
"Suppose the sheriff had had a gun?"
The man jerked his head toward the
field wherein fifteen or twenty ictims
had been buried and saidPersonal
"He'd 'a' bin oer thar"
"And will big Pete get clear?"
"Likely; but he'll hae to leae here
The boys hae already put him down

Not All Reformed
At a dinner gien by a philanthropist
to the Society of Reformed Criminals a
gentleman complained to his host mid
way through the festiities that he had
lost his watch The host was a man of
great Ingenuity He caused all the
lights to be turned out Then he ob
seredPersonal "Some one here has a watch
that does not belong to him If by the
time I hae counted a hundred it is not
placed on the floor in the middle of the
room, the police will be sent for" He
counted a hundred, and the lights were
turned on again Thirtythree hand
some watches lay in the middle of the
room
It Was Bad
The other day a young London street
arab, haing found a bad sixpence,
was trying to make use of it at different
places, but to no purpose At last he
went Into a tobacconist's and asked for
a threepenny cigar
Ilalng got the cigar and also the
change, he was leaing the shop when
the man called outPersonal
"Come back here; it's a bad one"
"Neer mind, sir," replied the young
ster "I'll smoke it if it makes me ill"
And he bolted out of the door — Pear

Girls Help Waiters to Cheat
Among hotel employees sex does not
appear to make any difference so far
as honesty Is concerned, says the
Brooklyn Eagle Certain young women
who act as checkers in hotels work
with certain waiters Wheneer one of
the girls obtains a position the men
soon follow her, and the hotel proprie
tor is ictimized accordingly The wait
er who is in league with the checker
makes a small priate mark on the
check with which he desires to cheat
She sees It, and Instead of stamping
the prices against the articles ordered
she puts her fingers oer the figures on
the die so that a slight blotch is all
that is recorded in the place for figures
The waiter does the rest She keeps
her account against her confederates,
and they settle up later on the outside

our national blsfory bad Abraham Lin
coln been born In luxury, surrounded
with great libraries, free to the multi
form adantages of  schools, college*
and  uniersities, the manifold  oppor
tunities for culture that wealth be
stows? Who shall say whether the ab
sence of all incentie to effort might
not hae smothered such a genius?
What wealthy, city bred youth of to
day, glutted with opportunities for ac
quiring knowledge, can feel that hun
ger for books, that thirst for knowledge
that spurred Lincoln to scour the wil
derness for many miles to borrow thi
coeted "Life of Washington" which
be had heard that some one In the
neighborhood owned? 
What young lawyer of our day goes
to a law school or library with such a
keen appetite, with such a yearning f oi
legal knowledge, as this youth had
when be actually walked fortyfoui
miles to borrow Blackstone's "Commen
taries?" „; _ ,  ;
Where is the student In college or
uniersity today who experiences that
satisfaction, that sense of conquest,
which thrilled Lincoln while lying on
the floor of his log cabin working out
arithmetical problems on a woodes

enthusiastically deouring the contents
of a j borrowed book, , as If his eyes

"Whence got this man his style, seeing

LAY UP YOUR TREASURES
Wo Han Should Spend the 'Whole of
His Income
la anyone too poor to sae? la an Im
portant problem which the readers of
a London dally are at present attempt
Ing to sole The question la not by
any means a new one It is one which
has troubled past generations, Just as,
in all probability It will affect the gen,
erations yet to come We cannot say
that this latest discussion of the sub
ject Is throwing much, if any, fresh
light upon It  
In the first place, there is a diersity
of opinion regarding the term "poor"
One man, who deries an Income of
91350 ' a year from priate property,
fancies he comes under the category,
while another does not consider any
one poor who has an Income of $500 a
year, says a' writer In Leslie's Weekly
It is manifestly Impossible to fix any
limit in a matter like this Very much
depends upon the locality and the con
ditions and surroundings of the indi
idual An Income that would be
amply sufficient to Insure a family a'
comfortable home, excellent social ad
antages and a good liing In a coun
try illage would mean many pria
tions and sore discomforts in any large
city
On the whole, howeer, we are In
clined to beliee that MaxO'BeU's
iews on the point  under discussion
come nearer the safe and common
sense rule than anything we hae seen
"I do not care," he says, "how small
the Income of a man is, he should neer
spend the whole of it, especially if he
has a wife and children He should
at least sae enough to pay eery year
the premium on a good life policy No
man is worthy of the name who does
not do this, at least, at the price of

REPEALING THE LAN LAWS
The senate committee on public
lands has recommended the passage
of a bill now before congress repeal
ing the timber and stone act, the
desert land act, and the commuta
tion clause of the homestead law
This wholesale restriction of exist
ing methods of disposing of the
public domain has been prompted by
the alarming rate of alienation of
land from the goernment of j late
years The startling statement is
made that for the first three months
of the present fiscal year oer six
million acres were filed upon This
rate means thirty million acres per
year Continued for fie years this
rate would exhaust all the land suit
able for settlement now in the hands
of the United States It is esti
mated that the total area of public
land at present embraces fie hun
dred million acres, only a small por
tion of which is aailable for the
home seeker Much of this is com
posed of rugged mountain land unfit
for cultiation, or large tracts of
desert land requiring a ast outlay
in proiding irrigation to bring it
into arable condition Under these
circumstances it is contemplated to
repeal all laws proiding for the
alienation of public land, except the
homestead law, imposing residence
and cultiation for fie years before
patent can be applied for
Officials who are looking for a
jump in their salaries as the out
come of the proposed new county
goernment bill, are likely to be dis
appointed It is reported that Go
ernor Pardee is likely to eto it if
it reaches him Many of the coun
ties, like Amador, hae proided for
an increase of compensation of ari
ous county officials, with the clause
inserted that the act shall take effect
immediately This is done for the
benefit of present incumbents The
goernor, it is said, is not inclined
to brush aside a plain constitutional
proision by affixing his signature
to a measure so defiantly in opposi
tion to the restrictions imposed upon
i the legislatie body by the funda
mental law It is really amusing to
note how interested parties chafe
when mention is made of constitu
tional barriers to this salary grab
business For Amador county, it is
urged, that if the bill passes, inas
much as the taxpayers of the county
are the parties in interest, the mat
ter should be left in the hands of the
superisors, without a recourse to
the courts This is rich It means
that the tribunal established by the
people to interpret the laws should
be ignored in this case, and a body
whose business is on an entirely dif
ferent plane should be left to decide
the issue The proposition is richer
still, when it is remembered that a
petition has been circulated and
signed by the members of the board
of superisors of Amador county,
approing the proisions of the bill
as far as they concern this county
Our esteemed and scrupulous demo
cratic cotemporary also comes to
the rescue of the salaryexpansion
program, by branding the McKen
ney bill as a good one, using the
stereotyped argument that increase
ed pay necessarily means better ser
ice and more competent officials
; He swallows the "takeeffectim
mediately" clause also ' So that his
 betterserice plea falls of its own
weight as far as the next four year's
are concerned The officers are
already elected for that length of
time; the competency is fixed by the
moral and mental characteristics of
incumbents How increase of com
pensation is to command better ser
ice under these conditions we leae
our logical cotemporary to explain
The mere changing from a fee to
a salary basis in the payment of
township officers is not the most dis
couraging feature of the proposed
law Viewed in the light of an ex
periment it does not amount to
much But for our lawmakers to
arrogate powers which the people
hae in express and positie terms
resered, is a serious matter And
to endeaor to urge them on in this
course by trying to create a wae of
popular approal in defense of such
unconstitutional methods is deplor
able Well may we ask,' "Whither
; are we drifting?"

| One law passed by the present
legislature, on the recommendation
of the sheriffs' organization, will
meet with uniersal approal It
proides that all sales under fore
closure of mortgage must be made
by the sheriff of the county in which
the real estate is situated This was
the system in ogue formerly But
for a number of years, the law has
left it discretionary with the su
perior court to appoint a commis
sioner to do this j work, \ and J pocket
the fees If the sheriff does the sell
ing, the fees must be paid into 'the
county treasury In the course of a
year the aggregate of such fees will
run up to a considerable amount
In the case of the Moore mine sale,,
the commissioner was allowed some
thing like $1500, and the county
treasury was not enrichsd to the ex
tent of one dollar Had the sheriff
made the sale in his official capacity,
the whole of the fees would hae
gone into the public treasury It is
refreshing to be able to cite this new
law as indicatie of a tendency to
reform the practice of dierting fees
that properly belong to the "county,

COMMUNICATION
Sacramento, Cal, Mar 10
ear SirPersonal—
There haying been some criti
cism of Assembly Bill No 846,
creating a salary for the payment
of justices of the peace and con
stables in Amador county, in crim
inal cases, I beg to call your at
tention to the following statement
of factsPersonal
The bill was prepared and intro
duced at the request of a large num
ber of the leading citizens of Ama
dor county, I receied a petition
from the county board ot super
isors signed by them unanimously,
in which the following statement "is
madePersonal *
"That after a full examination of
your measure, Assembly Bill No
846, reference to fixing a salary for
justices of the peace and constables
of the arious townships of Amador
county, we do hereby endorse the
same, and trust that said bill will
become a law, as we deem it just and
reasonable"
 A petition signed by one hundred
and fourteen oters and taxpayers
of Sutter Greek has been receied
Among the list of names was that of
E C Voorbeis, Jackson ennis,
Morris Brinn, and other well known
and prominent citizens from Amador
county
From Amador City a petition con
taining thirtytwo  names was re
ceied, including the leading citizens
and taxpayersPersonal* ;••"»•*••
Without giing ' a lonfc list of
names or any further quotations, [the
extracts from priate letters we
deem it adisable to omit in the
absence of any definite request for
the publication of this article — Ed] I
think it is eident that there has
been a general demand that the jus
tices and constables should be put
on a salary In arranging these sal
aries I hae put them extremely low,
lower than those of any other coun
ties in the state
I beg to call your attention to the
fact that out of the fiftysix coun
ties of the state, not including San
Francisco, twenty pay their justices
and constables salaries in criminal
cases In ' eery one of them the sal
aries paid are nearly twice what
they are in my bill for Amador coun
ty, and if the difference in popula
tion in the seeral townships is taken
into consideration, the economy of
my rates is een greater Taking
only the fie counties with smaller
population than Amador which pay
salaries, Kings, Stanislaus, Merced,
Colusa and Glenn, under the Act of
1897, we find the rates for Kings, in
townships haing a population of
four thousand, justices get $75 a
month, and constables as much In
Stanislaus, townships haing a" pop
ulation of oer 2800 pay their jus
tices $70 a month, and their con
stables $90; in townships haing a
population of from 2400 to 2800, the
justices get $50 and constables $80;
in townships ranging from 1600 to
2400, the justices get $40 aad the
constables $60 In Merced county,
justices in townships haing more
than 3500 get $100 a month, and con
stables the same; in townships ha
ing a population of from 2000 to
3500, the justices get $75 a month,
and the constables $75 In Colusa
county, the justices get $75 a month
in townships haing a population of
oer 900, and constables as much
In Glenn the salaries are the same
Compare those figures with the
$40 gien Amador justices, and the
$60 constables receie in townships
haing oer 3000 population, and the
$35 justices get, and the $55 gien
constables in the other townships of
the county The other proisions of
the new law are identical with those
of all the other counties in the state
paying salaries in criminal cases to
their township officers '
I may add that a large number of
bills hae been introduced this
session by the representaties of the
different counties which do not, as
yet, pay their justices and constables
salaries, the object being to create
salaries for those officials Personal '
1 In eery one of these, bills the sal
aries are ery much larger than
those I proposed In San Bernar
dino county, for instance, in town
ships haing a population of 2000;
and less than 6000, justices are to re
ceie $75 per month, and the sal
aries that I propose are to be paid
to justices and constables in town
ships of between 800 and 1000 inhabi
tants In estimating the expense of
this new bill, it is only fair that the
present fees paid the justices and
constables, should be deducted from
the amount which they would re
ceie in salaries
If this is done, I am satisfied that
the increased expenditure will be
ery slight, while the increase in the
serice rendered, and the character
of men who would be called upon to
accept the positions will be ery
great, and will more than offset the
increased expenditure
I preparing, introducing, and
passing these bills, I hae sought to
carry out the wishes of the ast
majority of my constituents, and I
hae endeaored to look after the
best interests of Amador county,
and to keeptbeexpenses as low as
possible consistent withthe''firsll

class serice The letters of endorse
ment which I am receiing from the
citizens all oer the county, endors
ing these bills and approing of the
principle they represent, conince
me that I hae made no mistake i
supposing that it was the wish of
the people of Amador county that
their justices and constables should
receie salaries in criminal cases
The other proisions of the bill in
relation to the transportation of
prisoners, arid the duties of the con
stables when sent out of his town
ship, are exactly similar with ihe
proisions affecting township officers
in the other counties of the state
where salaries are paid them

His position precluded hi'jn from seeing

The case of Jack Adams, arrested
for burglarizing the Jackson bakery,
remains unchanged Although the
justice returned last Monday, no com
plaint has been sworn to yet We are

justice Goldner, and that Mr Cade
martori has been notified of the fact,
And that if he wished to sign it ho
could do so He has not signed it
What the charge is we hae not learn

therefore not a public record A ques

it is to make complaint in the eent
that the owner of the stolen property
declines to do so oes this duty do

ArgonautKennedy Case
The long drawn out legal battle be
tween th' Argonaut Mining Company
and thi Kennedy Mining Company,
which Kn3 been Kfore the stato and
United Slates courts for the past fight
years, was brought to a close last Mon
day Tho questions inoled has been
before tho United States supreme
court for final adjudication for seeral
mouths, and a decision ha= been ex
pected nt any time for seeral weoks
past Monday uflurnoon W, F etert,
who is the largest stockholder and
presideitof tho plaintiff corporation,
reccieil a brief dispatch from C H
Lindley of San Francisco, the leading at
torney for the Argonaut, substantiallyPersonal
ArgonautKennedy decision affirmed
ChiefJustice iuderod opinion Only
two dissenting White and McKenna
Congratulations ~
Tho news soon spread all oer towp,
and general satisfaction was expressed
that this protracted struggle was at last
ended The ital point inoled in this
controersy was concerning the extra
lateral rights of the Argonaut The
minewas located under the old law,
which did not require tbe end linns of
a mining location to be parallel The
Argonaut north end line, and the Ken
nedy south end line are not parallel to
each other, and the Argonaut contend
ed that it was entitled to follow the;
ledge in its" eastern pitch by drawing
the surface lines downward in their
own direction This, under the peculiar
circumstances, would make the Argo
naut claim widen out with depth* It
would gio the plaintiff considerably
more ground at the depth of two
thousand feet than it had within its
surface boundaries Actual mining at
the Kennedy deeloped the fact that
the richest spot of the mine was con
tained i a piece of wedge shaped
ground inoled in this dispute The
Kennedy had taken ore from this dis
puted ground, and tbo Argonaut sued
for heay damages for trespass 'In
the Calaeras court the Argonaut won,
and was awarded about $60,000 dam
ages In the supreme court of the
slate this decision was affirmed The
United States supreme court was ap
pealed to for final decision That
court has now settled the matter de
cisiely in faor of the Argonaut
Eight of the nine justices participated,
six being for the Argonaut The
money judgment including interest now
foots up something liko $85,000
' Tbe early resumption of work at tbe
Argonaut mine is looked forward to as
an important factor in the reial of
business in Jackson It is not likely
that work will bo started for soeral
months There aro no supplies on
hand i tbe shape of timbers and other
material Thtw canuot be bad for two
or three months yet The shaft of the
Argonaut has been sunk to the depth
of 2300 foet From the 1400 leel the
ore in the hitherto' disputed Aground
has been untouched Tins gies about
1000 feet of ground to work upon with
out sinking — sufficient ore in sight to
ruu the 40 stamp mill for seeral years,
assuming that the ore body continues
through the un worked territory
Wine Shipment
G B Arata, who lies seeral miles
east of Jackson, has made this season
about 2000 gallons of wine The entire
product was shipped this week to Pat
terson, New Jersoy It is found to
realize a much better price by sending
it direct to the east The price paid,
free on board at lone, was 45 cents per
gallon, which leaes a fair margin of
profit Indeed, winemaking at these
figures can be made quite a profitable
Industry in those foothills He has
also distilled this year about 200 gal
lons of brandy from grape cheese, the
refuse left from winemaking Two
barrels of this liquor he expects to send
east, where it brings about $250 per
gallon, which is from 50 to 75 cents per
gallon more than it can be sold for in
tho borne market

inside ae Phillips, who has been
doing serice during the illness of
Chris Hansen, was drier Tho bag
gage wagon was ahead about fifty
yards with one passenger,, and a
heay load of baggage An ' extra
stage also well loaded was some distance
behind the fourhorse stago The
point selected for this exploit in high
waymanship was near the junction of
the Buena Vista and lono roads, about
a quarter of a mile below Miller's
station There is a bend in the road,
also a culert, and the drier gae a
crack of the whip starting the horses
to a brisk pace, just as a ritle shot was
heard — which was the first intimation
those on the outside hud that anything
was amiss A lady passenger declares
howeer, that she saw the man on the
right of the road before a shot was
fired; that he called "Halt" twice be
fore firing She said he rose from be
hind some loose brush The discbarge
of the weapon bad the effect of start
ing the team to a furious gallop Those
on board looked to find out the mean
ing of the firing A short interal
elapsed between the first and second
shot The highwayman was in plain
iew standing in the open, on the right
hand side, about fifty yards from the
stage, with his gun to shoulder, when
the second shot was tired This was
proof positie that an attempted hold
up was in progress, and tho passengers
were anxious thereafter to keep out of
sight of tho man with a gun Mc
Connell waa armed with a sawedoff
shotgun, and as he was seated furthest
from tho wouldbe robber, with the
drier between, he was unable to bring
his gun into play He saw the road
man after tho second shot, who then
had his gun down, as if in the act of re
loading Realizing thathe was haudi
capped by position, he told the drier
to whip up the animals, which he did
At least fie shots were fired, two bul
lets striking the off wheel horse One
shot took effect in the hip, and the
other belieed to be the last shot  pass
ing through the neck Blood spurted
in streams from these wounds, but the
wounded horse kept going, until Mil
ler's station was reached, where the
stage pulled up, and a" messenger dis
patched to lone to conoy the news of
the crime to the authorities, and also
to bring up another horse to continue
the trip The wounded horse diod
during the stay at Miller's station
The news of the crime was sent by
telephone from uf rune's station, oer
a mile from the scene of the holdup
It was quarter past fie o'clock when
the sheriff's office receied the notice
Sheriff Norman and deputy Jackson
immediately started out, and in one
hour were at Buena Vista— fourteen
miles distant At the scene of the
shooting, Jackson pickod up some
shells, supposed to hae been discarded
by the road agent They were of
30x30 size, the improed Winchester
weapon, of great penetrating power
Smokeless powder was used in the at
tack, those on the stago perceiing no
smoke during the shooting
No clear description of the shooter
can be gien Mr McNichols, one
of the passengers, says he had a
good iew of him as he stood with
his gun to his shoulder as he was
about to fire the second time He
wore a black mask oer his face It
looked similar to those used at mas
querades He thought he was under
rather than oer medium height, and
from general appearance was quite
young Others say he was coered to
his waist with a black coering In
the excitement and peril of the moment
no ono was disposed to take a critical
iew for the purpose of identification
While the fusilado of shots was in
progress, ho kopt running, following
the horses, till they were out of sight
by the turn of the road The fact that
the stago was not stopped was bwing
to the drier lashing the horses into a
rapid pace before tho shooting Had
they been going slow, it is argued, tho
wounded animal would hae dropped,
in which eent a duel between the
guard and the bandit would hae been
fought to a finish The shotgun
carried by guard McConnell was useful
at short range, two or three hundred
yards The pace of the horses put him
out of range in a few seconds, while as
far as carrying power is concerned, tho
rifle in tho hands of the desperado
would carry a mile
Mrs Soboy and her 13year old boy
were on the front seat inside, with
backs to tbo drier Their position
commanded the best iew of the out
law's operations
It was discoered Wednesday morn
ing that one of the lead horses was
struck by a bullet, the misslo just
grazing the top of his neck, producing
a slight flesh wound Also, both bridle
reins of wheel horeo that was killed
were pierced by a bullet; the check
rein between the two loaders was per
forated All these marks on the bar
might possibly hae been made by one
rifle ball The shooter may be a green
horn in stagerobbing, but his work
speaks for itself as to his expertnoss
with a gun The first shot, It is now
thought, was aimed at the nearest
horse's head, and it parsed through
the reins only an inch or two below the
mark
There is considerable chapparel on
the low hills i the icinity of the shoot
ing It was probably on this account
that the particular spot was selected
It reaches away toward Buena Vista r
and affordod near shelter A man
hiding therein could not be easily fol
lowed All the circumstances point to
a noice in the holdup line being
the perpetrator It was a bright
moonlight night, which added to the'
risk of capture
Some spom to think that the first
shot was aimed at those outside, as the
drier heard the whiz of the rifle ball
Four discarded shells were found in
the icinity They were soeral yards
apart, the distance between the first
and last shell was about fifty feet Sher
iff Norman and deputy Jackson found
foot tracks from where the outlaw shot
to the top of a hill nrur by, which com
manded a iew of the road as far as
Miller's station From there the tracks
led through the brush in a southerly
direction toward Jackson alley The
tracks were followed by the officers for
miles Boyond the empty shells, tho
robber, left nothing behind him, and
there is nothing to indicate that more
than ono man is implicated in the
affair Sheriff Norman returned home
Thursday night  eputy sheriff Jack
son and constables are still actiely en
gaged in the work of trying to run
down the perpetrator

Marsino Bros, respectiely
Sargent— The parties who were
working this property ' under a bond
hae surrenderedit to tbe owners It
is understood that nothing more will
be done under the bond The cause of
the quitting was probably due to an
unwillingness to meet the obligations
of the bond on the deelopments made
' Zeila— This mine is expected to 're
sume mining operations early next
week Some delay has been caused by
making some needed changes to hoist
ing machinery The large flywheel,
which has done serice eer since the
reopening of the mine, has been super
seded by one of smaller dimensions
The discarded wheel weighs three tons;
the new wheel weighs one half that
amount A new clutch and now pinion
hae also been put in The shaft and
machinery is in better shape now than
at any time for many years It is
thought that seeral years of steady
working will elapse before a shut down
for shaft repairs will be imperatie
The machinery was expected to be in
running order last Wednesday night
It will take a couple of days to take the
water out of the shaft  ' The beginning
of next week the mill will probably be
started

Important Point Inoled
Judge Rust went oer to San An
dreas Monday to try an important
mining case, inoling the title to the
Fellowcraft mine in the townsite of San
Andreas The point in issue is whether
a townsite patent can under any circum
stances gie any title whateer to a
known mining claim existing within the
boundaries of the townsite The
Fellowcraft mine, it is alleged, • was
located as a mining claim prior to the
townsite The locator, howeer, inter
posed no ' objection to the townsite
coering his property, and accepted the
title under the townsite location The
annual assessment was not kept up,
and Personal the claim, ; was jumped for non
performance of assessment The con
test Is now on to decide whether' the
original locator or the relocator shall
hold the property Eminent attorneys
haejbeen engaged on each side, and it
is belieed that whicheer way the
court holds, the case will bo appealed
to the, higher courts for final decision

The Miners' Union
A special meeting of Jackson Miners'
Union No 115 was held in their hall on
Court street on Thursday eening of
last week A committee was appointed
some time ago to endeaor to obtain
recognition of the union by the arious
mine owners operating in Amador
county This special meeting was
called to receie the report of this com
mittee The statement was made that
an agreement had been entered into
with M J Mconald, the owner of the
Keystone mine at Amador City, to the
effect that no distinction would be
made either for or against union men
in that mine An arbitration com
mittee has been appointed to endeaor
to arrange with other mine owners in
the county What effect this will hae
upon the mining industry of Amador
county remains to be seen The fact
of it is, this union was organized in a
spirit of hostility to employers It
started out on the theory that the
mine owners were legalized robbers,
and by the sheer force of numbers they
proposed to change the condition of
affairs JJow, they hae wisely
changed their tactics, and hold out the
olie branch of peace Threats and
intimidation hae not worked as they
anticipated, so the attempt is made to
conceal the claws under the elet
paws
A committee of the union, consisting
of Messrs W P Earts, H Gobish
and Rattoich, waited upon superin
tendent W, F etert at the Zeila office
last Monday, presumably, to secure
recognition of the union in some way
Mr etert stated that he could not
speak for the companies in which he
was interested, but indiidually he was
opposed to coercion in any form The
meeting left the situation unchanged \
Champion Egg Eater
The attaches of the Loure restaur
ant were treated to an eyeopener in
the way of gormandizing one day last
week " A fish peddler, haing a load
of catfish for sale, appeared in town
He was a stranger in this section He
walked into the restaurant with a sack
containing eggs, which presumably he
had receied in trade for fish He
gae the sack to Tony Lubimar, the
proprietor, and told him to fry them
Tony sized up his appetite i from ap
pearance as nothing out of the normal,
and thought he would gie him ample
leeway, so he started to take half a
dozen eggs from the sack to cook them
The stranger stopped him, and told
him to cook them all Tony opened
his eyes in astonishment at this He
was curious enough to count the eggs,
and found 74 in the bag He handed
the entire stock to his cook, who pro
ceeded to dump them into the pans
They filled two large pans The
stranger got outside of the whole out
fit, besides side dishes in proportion
He was not working for a wager either,
but simply eating for the loe of eating
Tony has been in the ; restaurant busi
ness for a number of years, and during
that time has witnessed some tall deeds
in the eating line, but this experience
far eclipses them all After demolish
ing this feast, the man took his de
parture unconcernedly, as though he
had taken aboard nothing more than
an ordinary meal

PINE GROVE
The adage that people who lie in
glass houses should not throw stones,
taken in its figuratie sense, may or
may not be true, but considered
literally, een philosophers will agree
as to its correctness True as this may
be, there are good citizens among us
who do not always reckon the conse
quences of a fracture of this maxim —
nay, who do not hesitate to cast iory
spheres with force at the object, or
objects of their wrath, and that, too,
in a place crowded with human creat
ures bent on whiling away a happy
hour around the green cloth with
cinches at 25 c
Moses said in substance — "If a dis
putant cast a billiard ball at ye be un
moed and let him cast twain"
But sportdom in Pine Groe declares
with emphasis that the means of retali
ation is to go out into the street,
gather an armful of rocks and clean
out the house

Main street were turned out early and
abruptly Sunday eening

You work day and night or you play
day and night which is sometimes
more exhausting, and go at the limit of
your speed all the time You are oer

and that needlessly, for you probably
hae enough to last a long and useful

A MONTE CARLO LEGEN
The Story the Cronplers Tell of the
Wnnderlnjj Jew
All gamblers are superstitious, and
some of their pet superstitions are now
ao old as to hae acquired the respec
tability of enerable traditions The
croupiers of Monte Carlo hae an In
teresting set of traditional supersti
tions of thenPersonal own, most of which are
entirely unknown to the many thou
sands of isitors who toy with the
"tiger" in that gilded court of chance
The most striking of these is the
story of the Wandering Jew, which the
croupiers beliee as ferently as they
do that the bank will down any "sys
tem" that eer was inented There
la one day, and one day only, in the
year on which the rooms of the casino
at Monte Carlo are closed— that is on
Good Friday When the rooms are
opened on the following day, they say,
the first person to enter the "Grand
Nouelle Salle de Jeur" is an old man
of enerable appearance He wastes
no time; but, walking straight to one
of the tables, he places with the trem Personal
bling fingers of extreme old age a
piece of money upon a certain number
The wheel is turned, the croupier's na
sal cry falls upon the ear, announcing
that the number selected by the old
man has won With a bitterly saage
exclamation the aged man seizes his
winnings, throws them about him and
hurries from the room to disappear, no
one knows where
He la the Wandering Jew, and until
he can lose a bet at Monte Carlo he
must continue his wanderings Get on
the "blind side" of any of the old crou
piers of Monte Carlo, and they will tell
you this legend Hae they seen him?
Of course they hae and are fully per
suaded that the aged and mysterious
stranger is none other than the man
condemned to perpetual earthly wan
derings nearly 2,000 years ago

A FEAST THAT FAILE
The Story of it Raccoon That • Was
Not Sered For Breakfast
It Is* within the memory of many
people that the custom* of schoolteach
ers "boarding around" was the usual
thing In country districts Although
a custom which teachers seldom liked
It Is doubtful if many of them had as
hard a time aa a young schoolmaster
who described his experience in the
New England Galaxy for 1817 The
irticle was written by Leonard Ap
thorp, then an undergraduate of Bow
floin college' The young schoolmaster
was to receie $15 a month and his
board
From the flrst day I perceied that
I was at board on speculation and at
the mercy of a close calculation, he
writes One day the whole dinner, con
sisted of a single dumpling, which
they called a pudding, and fie sau
sages, which in cooking shrank to the
size of plpestems There were fie of
us at table
A few days afterward, on my return
from school, my eyes were delighted
by the sight of an animal I had neer
seen before It was a raccoon, which
the young man, Jonathan, had killed
and brought home in triumph' When
skinned, he seemed to be one entire
mass of fat and of a most delicate
whiteness I was oerjoyed and went
to bed early to dream of delicious
steaks which the morrow would bring
Long before daylight I heard the
family stirring, and the alacrity of
quick footsteps and the repeated open
lug and shutting of doors all gae as
surance of the coming holiday
I was soon ready for breakfast, and
when seated at table' I obsered that
the" place of Jonathan was acant
"Where Is Jonathan?" I asked, j
"Gone to market," said they ;
"Market! What market, pray? I
did not know there was any market
in these parts"
"Oh, yes," they said, "he Is gone to
, about thirty miles to the south
ward of us"
"And what has called him up so
early to go to market?"
"He is gone," said they, "to Ben hie
raccoon"  ;
An Obstacle to Piety
A story told by a western congress
man Is about two brothers, Ed and
Jim, who dealt in wool at their home
in lowa Jim went to a reial meet
Ing (unthinkingly, the congressman
says) and "got religion" In his first
burst of enthusiasm he told his brother
of how much better he felt since his
conersion and urged Ed to come Into
the fold The latter pondered graely
for a tune and then saidPersonal "Ain't any
doubt but what religion's a good tiling,
and I'm glad yon'e got It, Jim, but I
guess you better let me alone Just
how," he continued reflectiely "You
see, Jim, one of us has got to weigh the
wool"

STEERAGE PASSENGERS
Immigrants For America Are Looked
Upon as Cargo
One or the biggest liners sailing out
>r France, with 800 steerage passen
jers aboard, was selected for obsering
the manner of handling steerage pas
sengers bound for America
A firm conclusion reached after the
experience of that trip is that an Immi
grant of this class has to put up with
uuch unnecessarily unpleasant treat
ment—first simply because be Is an
Immigrant and therefore in judgment
meriting It and, secondly, because, be
ing what he Is, he baa not yet learned
10 protect himself The picture con
jured up by the term 'Immigrant" In
the minds of those who hae their core'
m route is not at all the color of the
Hslon that arises before us with the
word Here In America we hae* a
notion of a band of earnest and, It may
be, if we are uncharitable, worn and
unwashed men and women with fam
ilies, though the family and the wash
ing are really outside for the moment
Uurrying from hard conditions of life —
leant underpaid labor, ignorance, op
pression, misrule—pressing on to what
they must conceie to be a bright land
of promise or they would not be rush
Ing here; to a glorious young country,
where all men are free and equal and
all that sort of thing But the man
who has to see that these Immigrants
are gien food and bunk and that they
do not fall ' sick below has no such
fancies His sympathy, he will tell
you, Is not for the Immigrants, but for
the country that Is to get them
Those In charge of the Immigrant
from southern Europe will tell you thai
he is not a desirable creature They
hae handled many, many thousands
of his kind, and they should know
something of him now The company
transports him, It Is true, but as to
that be Is freight; freight of good
profit The company would take freight
to the highest degree distasteful if so
be the rates were paid Indeed, yes It
is a business There is a large profit in
the Immigrant— oh, yes— but as a fel
low passenger he Is— oh, well, repul
sie, repugnant or whateer you say In
your language— James B Connolly In

CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP
A German Hotel Keeper's Opinions
on  Hotheaded Peoples
"I think that the Americans are alto
gether too quick to pick a quarrel,"
said a German hotel keeper In Harlem
who had Just had a petty tussle in put
ting out an unwelcome customer
"They are not to be compared with
the French," said an American lawyer
who happened to drop In "Why, you
know about those French apprentices,
how they are always ready to fight
and often lose their lies oer a few
wordst" • 'Personal~
"I'e heard about theso apprentices,"
said the German "We hae them In
our country They roam around the
country But what of that?'
"Yes," was the answer "A party of
them, with a leader and representing
some craft will, for Instance, meet an
other party of apprentices They are
organized into different societies, each
intensely jealous of the other, and If
two such bands are different societies
there is a fight in an instant First the
leaders come to blows, and then the
melee becomes general They fight
with flsts and sticks until the road is
Uttered with the wounded and some
times the dead"
The German, not to be outdone by
the French, said before he had thought
twicePersonal, "That's nothing Why, our stu
dents In the  uniersities hae fights
They belong to different societies and
fight with sabers Because of some lit
tle Insult often one will hae his head
fairly cut open"
"And yet yon complain about the
Americans!" said the lawyer as he

stepped Into his own trap— New York

A True Friend
It takes a great soul to be a true
friend— a large, catholic, steadfast and

forget much, forbear much It costs to
be a friend or to hae a friend There
is nothing else In life except mother
hood that costs so much It not only
costs time, affection, strength, patience,

down his life for his friends There Is

"One morning soon after the surren

Carefulness of Surgeons
It is an object lesson in godliness tfl
see a surgeon washing his hands after
performing an operation, says the Chi
cago Chronicle He works of course
with sleees rolled up to the elbow, so
that the washing extends from the cra
zy bone to the tip of the finger nail
First there is a hard scrubbing wltli,
plain soap and sterilized water This 1$
followed by a swabbing with tlncturs
of green soap and sterilized water
Then comes a genuine scouring with
equal parts of quicklime and soda in
sterilized water and finally a rinsing in
a solution (1 to 2,000) of bichloride of
mercury Without these four separate
washings no surgeon would think of
enturing out to scatter germs of dis
ease

Unsuccessful Inentions That Pre
ceded Howe's Patent Id 1946
The technical beginning ot the sew
ing machine Industry In this country
was Sept 10, 1840, when Ellas Howe,
Jr, obtained a patent for what grew
Into the first really practical sewing
machine Only three of the flrst Howe
machines were made, howeer, and
one of these was deposited In the pat
ent office in Washington as a model
It was not until after 1850 that a fac
tory for the making of sewljjg nia
chines was built bo the enormous busi
ness of today has grown up in a short
half century
While Howe's inention marked the
beginning of a successful Industry, he
was by no means the pioneer in ef
forts to substitute mechanical for hand
sewing As far back as 1770 Thomas
Alsop patented in England a macWn§
for embroidering Another njapjjfne
for embroidering in a loom was tijyj§nt
ed by John uncan In ISO 4, an^weTj
tyfie years later another Englishman
named Hellman patented still another
embroidering machine
 The flrst recorded attempt at mg
chanlcal sewing was the inention' o£
Thomas Saint who took out a, patent
in England in 1700 for a machine jwhlgij
executed tho old crochet stitch |£
was not a success, but some of the
features of the Saint machino appear
in the perfected machine of today_ i
Bartholemy Thimonnier patepted iis
France in 1830 the first sewing CJaa
chine put to practical use Eighty o|
his machines were in use fof'sewjpß
army clothing in 1841, when a mbb^do^
stroyed them because coninced, they;
would drie seamstresses out of, em/
ployment Thimonnier built new'^AOd;
better machines, but all his work"*Personalwjasi
again destroyed by angry artisans in
1848PersonalPersonal^; ?i Personal  Personal
John J Greenough took ont the first
patent for a sewing machine issued in
the United States in 1542 It was la
tended to sew leather, but was of no
practical use
Walter Hunt of New York built a
sewing machine in 1834, but faded to
protect it by a patent After Howe's
machine appeared Hunt declared It
embodied the Ideas of his machine of
1834, but he was unable to establish
his claim
A small army of Inentors appeared
after Howe's patent had proed suc
cessful, and then genius was deoted
to perfecting eery part of the ma
chine How well they hae succeeded
Is shown in the 8,500 patents for sew
ing machines and attachments issued
by the United States since ISSO and in
the fact that the American sewing ma
chine leads all others in eery country

Care In Choosing; Glasses
A dealer in optical instruments de
clared that it gao him real pain to
note the careless manner in which half
the persons in New York wear glasses
"It Is a wonder to me," he said, |that
they don't bring on blindness In the
first place, the frames should always
be fitted to Indiidual faces instead of
being picked up indiscriminately with
out regard for facial peculiarities The
size of the lenses is another important
consideration Most of the glasses I
see on the street are too small They
should bo ns large as the face of the
wearer will permit, for a lens of good
size not only affords better, protection
to the eye, but is more becoming^than
a smaller one Another tribulation "of 1
tho weak eyed is due to the reflection
from the edges of unf rained glasses?
The eyelashes should be attended to" in
order to get the best results from a'
pair of spectacles Many lashes are
worn so long that they brush against
the glass This is decidedly injurious*!

A Lesson In Hospitality
A curious Instance of proincial hos
pitality In a small Tuscan town is re~
corded by Luigl Vlllarf in "Italian Ufa
In Town and Country"
A lady of ery noble birth and of
considerable wealth was giing a mu
sical party— lt was the flrst time she
had inited friends to her house that
season The entertainment began at
2 p m and lasted till 7 No refresh

but at half past 4 a serant appeared
and solemnly presented a cup of choco
late to the hostess and one to her moth
er This, of course, would only be pos
sible in a ery proincial town In the
more ciilized spots excellent refresh
ments are always offered to the guests
A Scriptnral Weapon
Children tumble Into strange morass
es when they grapple with theology
They trip oer words For example,
the other day a teacher at Stepney took
for the Bible lesson the story of Sam' (
son At the end of the lesson questions
were put to test the understanding of
the scholars "With what weapon did
Samson slay a thousand Philistines?"
was the question For a space there
was silence; Then a little girt spoke
