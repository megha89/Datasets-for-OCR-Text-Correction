MINING IS  BUSINESS, NOT  GMBLE
Nowihsanding ha mining is an indusry as old 'as hu
man ciilizaion,s srange wha crude and ofimes errone
ous impressiono n are enerained, een a he presen ime,
•ouside of he communiies where he indusry is carried on,
concerning he business of gold mining I is probable ha
a as majoriy of hose liing in nonmining communiies
who are accusomed o ines heir surplus capial in gold
quarz mines, are densely ignoran of naure's mehods
of operaion in he deposiion of gold in is naie marix —
quarzPersonal — and he processes inened by man for he exracion
of he precious meal from is rocky bed The as difference
beween placer mining and quarz mining is no fully un
dersood by many who lie in manufacuringceners bu who
are in he habi of inesing in gold enures because of he
immense reurns hey hold for he amoun of capial in
esed Men hae been made rich in an hour by sumbling
across a pocke of gold hidden away someimes in goldbear
ing grael and someimes in quarz These are facs ha
srongly appeal o he uniniiaed, and induce hem o ge in
on some highly colored groundfloor proposiion engineered
for he express purpose of exracing money from he pockes
of hese oercredulous people This is he gambling, he
speculaie side of he goldmining indusry, and mus be
classed as disinc from he business aspec I is by appeal
ing o he speculaie spiri ha he wildca schemes of new
mining fields are made o flourish They are designed no o
exrac gold from he earh, bu o dele ino he hardearned
saings of persons far remoed from he ground by inducing
hem o buy sock in goldmines ha exis mainly in he im
aginaion of unscrupulous promoers s a rule, s much
easier o make money by his sor of fake mining, han s
by he acual exploraion of he earh's crus in a hones
search afer buried reasures Very few persons conersan
wih he pracical side of mining are caugh by hese wild
ca proposiions, excep as a gamble They speculae in he
expecaion of making money in he buying and selling of
sock in such concerns, and no by he hope of diidends de
clared from he oupu he claims
I may be quesioned wheher his wildcaing in he long
run is any real help o legiimae mining The discoery of
of a prospecie gold mine in a new field is always aended
wih more or less exciemen, and he consequen inrush of
prospecors and adenurers The field is prey horoughly
exploied For eery claim saked ou for acual mining,
here is usually a score or more aken up for wildcaing pur
poses The losses incurred by he swindling operaions of
he laer end o discourage inesmen in he legiimae
business, no only in he newly discoered regions, bu also
in he old fields which hae been surrendering gold for gen
eraions pas, and which are no affliced o any exen wih
 he mehods of he wildca operaor
• mador couny is no aracing, a he presen ime, he
ineres from inesors which her proen mineral riches
should enile her o receie Prospecing operaions hae

Now, when I wns ho housand and

Siser, recie o us some new sory, de
lighsome nnd delecable, wherewih o
!ille away ho waking hours of our
lnor nigh"
"Wih joy nnd goodly will," answer
<d Shahraznd, "If his pious and nuspl
cloua king permi"
"Tell on," quoh he king, who had
frooly paraken of he dish ermed by
he Franks "he rabbi of Wales" nnd
ns sleepless and resless So Shnhrn
eal, rejoiced wih he prospec of alk
ing, hus began on he housand and
hird nigh "The Tale of ho Perplexed
PrincessPersonal"
far In he realm of Gurlcund, which
lies wihin he hind of Hindusan, once
reigned a mighy king who had ono
daugher of such exceeding beauy
Ilia all who beheld her became poes
nnd warriors, which was well for ho
naional fame, bu ill for he royal
reasury
Now, he loeliness of he princess
being such, i may seem srange ha
she had aained her eigheenh year
unmarried, ye so I befell, for in his
hesiancy because eff he groa muli
ude of eligible suiors he king, who,
hough oherwise respecable, was a
ilely deou heahen, made a ow
ha he would gie his daugher hi
marriage only o ha man who should
receie he indorsemen of his Idol, on
image of exceeding ugliness housed In
n golden emple adjacen o he palace
So I was ho ninny princes from
many lands enrae o bow before he
idol, offering splendid sacrifices and
rich gifs of reasure for he desired
sign of faor, ye eer he idol re
mained silen
 lengh here came from he Is
land of Lanka a prince of grea power,
and so deeply smien was he wih loe
for he princess ha he bowed before
he Idol, saying "Grea lord, gran
bu ha he princess may become my
bride, and hen shall I wihou delay
reurn o hee and cu off my own
head ns a hank offering!"
nd he nex day when he king and
all his cour came o worship In he
golden emple he eil spiri ha was
wihin he Idol caused he hand of he
Image o srech forh and poin o he
prince nnd caused he sone lips o
open and say o he king, "Behold hy
soninlaw!"
Forhwih was he wedding of he
prince and princess celebraed wih
grea pomp In ho palace, and sraigh
way hereafer In fulfillmen of his
ow, he prince hasened o he em
ple, bowed before he Idol and cu off
his own bend
Then enered he pries of he em
ple and In his Brief, horror and fear
for wha had chanced and for wha
migh well come o him in conse
quence likewise cu off his head 
Then enered he princess, seeking
her husband, and, seeing bu he wo
headless bodies, raised he prince's
sword and was abou o seer her own
loely head when he Idol spoke again,
BayingPersonal "Hold! Take ho bends and
ee hem upon he men's shoulders!"
nd he princess did een so nd
he heads grew fas o he bodies, and
he bodies rose upon heir fee
Bu now i appeared ha in her
hase and umul of mind he princess
had se he pries's head upon he
shoulders of he prince nnd he
prince's head upon he shoulders of
he pries, so ha in a way each was
he oher, ye neiher was eiher, and
each claimed her as his bride, and
each head, being a wise head, spake
many shrewd argumens one way and
he oher, ye could neiher preail
nd so wns ho princess sore perplex
ed, und in ruh, neer hae I learned
how logically o conclude he ale
"In sooh" said he klnp "'migh she
no hae ohulned a diorce?"
"Nay, sire" replied Shahrazad, "for
from whom? nd which mus she
hen hae married In accordance wih
he word of he, ldol?"
"Then," proposed he king, "why
migh hey no hae mached dinars o
decide which should hae her?"
"h my lord" said Shahrazad, shak
ing her head, "ha would hae been in
nccord wih ho easy, unscienific
mehod of he far wes, which would
sill hae lef he problem unsoled"
"Surely, hen," urged he king, "hey
migh hae fough for her"
"nd would hn hae deermined
he ruh?" rwpoudml Shahrazad "and
would no he icor hae been eiher
or boh a murderer nnd a suicide?
las, my lord, he insoluble perplexiy
of his fair princess hah caused me
much sorrow, and glad am 1 only ha
such sad dilemmas do no ofen occur"

sea paper in hose days reached all he norhern owns on
Saurday morning The residens all along he roue were
perfecly saisfied wih he mail faciliies hen afforded The
exension of railroad faciliies is usually aended wih im
proemeu in he mail carrying business; cerainly i should
no cause a deerioraion in auy par of he serice Bu his
has acually been he case wih regard a leas o ha porion
of he mineral bel norh of mador Ciy The hrough
mail roue from Jackson o Plymouh was dropped, and in
lieu hereof a roue from Jackson o mador Ciy, ia Mar
ell, was' insiued s far as Suer Creek and mador
Ciy are concerned, and heir communiciion wih he couny

conrac oer his roue on he ground ha he price asked
was oo high On he oher hand he sage owner explains
ha he change of ime required o mee he railroad ime
a Marells would hae been faal o he passenger raffic
oer he sage line, and hence he increased price asked for
carrying he mail The residens of norhern mador hae
been grealy inconenienced by his failure o secure a direc
serice wih he couny sea Mehods were resored o by
friendly arrangemens wih he sage line o one down he
inconenience as much as possible One of hese concerned
he deliery of he couny sea papers o he owns along he

il nigh, afer mos of he farmers from he oulying counry
had called for heir mail and gone home ' Bu by he kind

much appreciaed by boh publishers and subscribers nd
i worked no hardship upon any one Newspapers, under
secondclass raing, are sen hrough he mails free of charge
o any poiu wihin he couny wherein hey are published
So here was no loss of posage by he goernmen in sending
he papers by he sage line; on he conrary, he posal de

Bu he arrangemen has recenly been abooed by orders

AN AUDACIOUS PLAN.
H«w Captain Haraden Bluffed th«
Dri>;isher Into Surrender.
A fight Is n fight for 'n tlmt, anil
just ns nn example of early American
'•norve" n hldi'.v unearthed liy Itnliili
)). Pulne In the old Beit logs nt Ksnok
institute, in Bale til, Is of much inteftiJtt
It Is told liy Mr. I'nlne us follows In
Outing Alngnzlne: ' 'i. ■ '■■•
Tlio king's packet was a fo«? to tost
Cnptnln Ifiirndon's mrttlivniid he
found he hml n tough niHiifconist. Tuny
fought four full honrn; •■ "or four
glasses." as flic log records It. after
which Captain Ilnrmlon found tlint ho
must haul out of tlio notion nnd repair
damages to rigging nnd hull. Ho (!!«•
covered nlso that he had used nil the
powdor on hoard except one charge.
It would have hoen n credltnlile con
clusion of the matter If he had. called
the action n drawn hattle and gone- on
his way. ,
It vrna In his mind, however, to try
nn Immensely audacious plan which
could succeed only hy means of 'the
most cold blooded courage on his part.
Hamming home his last charge of pow
der nnd double shotting the gun. lie
ranged alongside his plucky enemy,
who wns terribly cut up. but still un
conquered, nnd hailed her:
"I will give you five minutes' to haul
down, your colors. If they are not
down nt the end of that time. I will
fire Into and sink you, so help me
God!"
It was n test of mind, not of metal.
The British commander wns n brave
man who had fought his ship like a
hero. But the sight of this infernally
Indomitable figure on the quarter deck
of the shot rent Pickering, the thought
of being exposed to another broadside
at pistol range, the aspect of tlio blood
stained, half naked privatoersmen
grouped at their guns with matches
lighted, was too much for him. Cap
tain Haraden stood, watch in hand,
calling off the minutes so that his voice
could be heard aboard the packet:
"Three."
But he had not said "Four" when
the British colors fluttered down from
the yard, and the packet ship wns his.
WONDERS OF WATER.
Extent to Which Fluid Mingles With
Bodice Apparently Solid.
The extent to which water mingles
with bodies apparently solid is won
derful. The glittering opal which
beauty wears as an ornament Is only
flint and water. In every plaster of
paris statue which an Italian carries
through our streets for sale there Is
one pound of water to every four
pounds of chalk. The air we breathe
contains five grains, of water to each
cubic foot of Its bulk. The potatoes
and turnips whiqh are boiled for our
dinner have in their raw state the one
75 per cent and the other 90 per cent
of water.
If a man weighing ten stone were
squeezed flat in a hydraulic press
seven and one-half stone of water
would run out and only two and one
half stone of dry residue remain. A
man is. chemically speaking, forty-five
pounds of cqrbon and nitrogen diffused
through five and a half, pallfuls of
water. In plants we find water thus
mingling in no 'less wonderful a man
ner.
A sunflower evaporates one and a
quarter pints of water a day and a
cabbage about the same quantity. A
wheat plant exhales in 172 days about
100,000 grains of water. An acre of
growing wheat, on this calculation,
draws and passes out about ten tons
of water per day.
The sap of plants Is the medium
through which this mass of fluid is
conveyed. It forms a delicate pump
by, which the watery particles run
with the rapidity of a swift stream.
By the action of the sap various prop
erties may be communicated to tbe
growing plant. Timber lv France is,
for instance, dyed by various colors
being mixed with water and poured
over the root of the tree. Dahlias are
also colored by a {similar process.—Lon
don Tit-Bits.
Making It Clear.
A very young child was saying his
prayers at the bedside In his grand
father's house. The grandfather, aux
tous to hear the boy. stood at the room
door, which was sufficiently open for
him to see and hear the child. After
the usual asking God to bless his par
ents the child reached "God bless
grandma and grandpa." At the men
tion of the last named, tbe boy's eye
catching sight of bis grandfather, be
stopped and, pointing his little finger,
said. "There bo is!"-Philadelphia In
quirer.
An Easy Job.
A schoolmaster set as an essay sub
ject to a class of bis young hopefuls
"What I would like to be," and one
pronouncement, delivered in a bold
half text, was as follows: "I would like
to be a horse driver. When you are
driving 11 horse you sit and do nothing.
You do that all day and feed tbe horse
at night and your work is done for
that day. Then when Saturday comes
you get your pay. and then you get all
Sunday to yourself." — Kansas City
Newsbook.
A Long Wait.
"Did you and your wife take n long
trip on your honeymoon?"
"It seemed long to me. Her fntber
had promised to settle a snug sum of
money on us as soon as we got back."
