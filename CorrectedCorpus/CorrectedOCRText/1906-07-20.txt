The defendan was indiced for he
murder o his wife in mador couny,
coniced, senenced o deab, aud
appeals from he judgmen and an
order denying his moion for a new
rial Many grounds are urged for a
reersal, bu s mainly insised
ha he erdic of he jury was no
warraned from he eidence
Before we approach he considera
ion of his claim, howeer, s
necessary o dispose o oher poins
raised by he defendan prior o he
acual rial, which were ruled on
adersely o him, and upon which he
predicaes error
These poins are ha he cour
erred in refusing o gran he moion
of defendan o be permied o wih

migh moe o se aside he iudic

upon he arraignmen of defendan,
March 9, 1905 he was represened by
an aorney, and be ime for recei

11, 1905, a which ime he enered a
plea of "no guily," and he ime
for rial, by consen of said aorney,

wihdraw his plea of "no guily,"
and make such moiou relaie o he

said moiou being based on he
grounds ha defendan could no
prepare for rial on he day se, and
ha be plea of "no guily" was
iuaderenly enered The moion
was based upon affidais which were
addressed mainly o a showing for a
coninuance, alhough as o he

i appeared herefrom ha be aor
ney represening defendan on he

was inexperienced and unacquained
wih be pracice in criminal pro

claimed ailed o make a moiou o

was based upon affidais seiug
forh ha cerain of he grand jurors

and also seing forh oher grounds
as a basis for he conemplaed moion

by a proffer of a moion o se aside
he iudicmen upon all hese
grounds
We are no adised, from anyhing
in he briefs of appellan, where he
found auhoriy in law warraning
him in making his second moion
Possibly ho cour upon applicaion
could hae permied he defendau o
renew his moiou, bu we know of uo
rule of procedure which eniled he
defendan as a maer of righ o re

Independen of his, howeer, he
affidais which accompanied he sec

he defendan and his counsel were
in possession of all he facs when

for seing aside he indicmen urged
on heir second applicaion No a
paricle of excuse, if any exised, is
suggesed why hey did no hen pre

O course, no 6ucb righ exiss For
hese reasons he second applicaion
was wihou warran and properly
denied
s o he denial o he moion of
defendan for a change of enue The
affidais on his moion were direced
o he poin wheher defendan could

he affidais, wihou deailing he
facs disclosed by hem, ha he de
fendan made a ery srong showing
in suppor of his moion, bu upou
seled principles o law we do uo
hink he defendan is in a posiion
o claim any error in he acion nf

moion was made he cour did no
make final disposiion of i, bu

Of course, couusel were familiar

rule of he aboe cases, now insis
ha he cour erred, when his righ

Haing disposed of hose objecions
we now come o a consideraion of
he principal poin insised upon by

warraned by he eidence
Uiing a general ouline of be
eidence, preliminary o a paricular
consideraion of i when we reach be
salien poins in he case, i appeals
ha defendan, a physician, and his
wife, a rained nurse, cok up heii
residence in uador Ciy in 1902,
where defendan engaged in he
pracice of his profession In June,
July and ugus, of 190, here was
an epidemic of yphoid feer in ha
ciy, and defendan was employed
professionally in many cases growing
ou of i, his wife assising him in

which will be considered laer— and
ook o her bei on he 1h of ha

employed a Mrf Keees as house
keeper, and on ugus 17h engaged
Miss McCarhy, a professional nurse,
o ake charge of bis wife; called r
Gail of Jackson ino consulaion,
and a he ime Miss McCarhy came
o nurse, called in JJr Quinn, who
prescribed for her and aended her
hereafer unil be morning of
ugus 29h On ugus 30h, Mis

uring he nigh afer be nurse lef,
Mrs baples became worse; nerous,
wih a sligh rise in emperaure,
which increased as he nigh adanc

nigh defendan was required o call
up Mrs Reees, who had reired, o
assis him Knemas haing been
adminisered by he defendan, Mrs
Saples became apparenly sronger

remained pracically during be day

while defendan was in he yard, Mrs.
Reees called him, saying his wife

She did no rally or become con

No puncure o he somach or an

Tbe embalming fluid used consised

The heory of he prosecuion is

here is no room for doub bu ha

ly shown from he eidence, no only
of he defendan bu o disineresed
winesses who were acually in aend

by r Quinn, who was aending
physician from he ime of her illness
unil wo days before her deah, and
by he esimony of r Gall, one of
he auopsy physicians who had been
called ino consulaion wih de
fendan when his wife firs ook ill,
and diagnosed her case as one of
yphoid feer I was furher con
firmed by he esimony of expers on

feer Howeer, we do no under

hough he disease wih which Mrs

cause of her deah; ha her deah
was caused bj he poisons specified,
adminisered by defendan while she
was suffering from ha disease
Mow as o he eidence ha he

by eiher of hese poisons, and firs,
as o he claim ha i occurred from

ponderance of he exper eidence
ends o confirm his conclusion The
purchase by defendan of erarum

her horoughly This rapid pulse

o examine Mrs Saples, urine; I
found he urine conained albumen,
and his srenghened he heory ha

always use erarum iride, incure
of eraium iride, and in order

he defendan, ha when he defend
an enered he drug sore and asked
or he incure o erarum iride,
he former inquired of him how Mrs
Saples was; he defendan said she
was worse, and ha he waned he
incure of eraiuuu iride for her
The druggis asked if he should label
i, and defendan answeied, "Yes,
you had beer, because 1 migh wan
i or some of my oher paiens"
These ae condiions aud circumsan
ces under which he purchase was
made; openly, and wih he declared
objec for which i was purchased
The undispued medical esimony in
he case shows ha while poisonous
when adminisered in excessie doses,
incure of erarum iride is a well
recognized official drug, adminisered
principally i cases of uraemic con
ulsions which someimes arise in
cases o yphoid feer So ha as far
as he purchase of he drug is con

should hey arise efendan esified
he complicaions he feaifld did no

Before proceeding o a furher con

did no accoun or i His faiiure,
howeer, o esify on direc examina

he prosecuion from making inquiry
in ba direcion, if i so desired;
hence i was a possible oersigh on

We do no hink ha any fuiher

wihou commening upon i furher

he deceased came o her deah from

Tuis branch of he case, in our judg

hae deoed o he claim o poison

or had in his possession any arsenic

bu here is no proof ha he did
Neiher a any ime during her illness
did Mrs Saples exhibi any sympoms
of arsenical poisoniug s o hose

Morgan esifiedPersonal 'The firs sympoms
of arsenical pcisouiug is a burning

ha i canuo be conrolled, he pa

His ouly esimony on ha poin was
ha he found here he quaniy of

r Morgan, an equally repuable
chemis, saed his belief in he ar
senic in ho somach came from he
embalming fluid, and in addiion
saidPersonal "My experience has augh me
o beliee ha s impossible for an
organ i he human body o be wihin
a few inches of embalming fluid for

absorbing somo of he arsenic The

he femoral arery a few inches and

oer he aora, no being separaed
from he inerior of he aora by more
hau an inch, and i would onlyhae
o rael ha small disance of issue
in order o reach he somach" He
furher esified, giing bis reasons
herefor, which space preens 'quo
ing, ha i was possible for arsenic
o pass frm he embalming fluid o
he somach wihou he chloride of
zinc or bichloride of uerury showing

The same may be said o wha is
denominaed by he prosecuion ei

No doub b' ha he jury had he
righ o consider his eidenoe, and
is poency was for heir deermina

amouned o his, ha a monh afer
Mrs Saples' deah defendan ook

ha on Ocober 22, 1905, Mrs lioxie,

The cour admied, under he

cupied by he defendan in El orado
in 1902 This eidence was admied
on he heory ha i supplied an
addiional moie for he murder by
defendan of his wife, because she
knew ha his desrucion of hese

hae prosecued him for iirsoii In

inadmissible In his regard s
sufficien o say ha when his

genous manures, lowers the power of
the plant to resist both blight and
rot.
So far as skin characteristics are an
index, the red varieties with thick
and rough skin seem more resistant
as a class than the thin-skinned white
varieties. So far as stem and foliage
characters are concerned, the evi
dence favors the stem that is hard,
rough, and rather woody at the base,
and the leaf that is small, somewhat
rough, and dark colored.
In America trials as to disease re
sistance have been conducted at some
of the experiment stations, notably in
Vermont, where experiments in breed
ing and selection for increased re
sistance are under way. These results
have been correlated with information
recently secured by a circular of in
quiry addressed to a large number of
potato specialists in the Northeastern
States and in Canada. From these It
appears that a wide variation is shown
in disease resistance among the varie
ties now in cultivation in America,
but that no one variety is preeminent.
Among those which have been wide
ly tested, the following deserve men
tion as of the resistant class: Dakoto
Red, Rustproof, Irish, Cobbler, Sir
Walter Raleigh, Doe Pride, and White
Beauty.
In tests made at the Vermont sta
tion in 1905 the following varieties

to Root Knot.
showed marked resistance to blight on
I'oth sandy loam and clay loam soils:
Keeper, American Wonder. Dakoto
Red. Doe Pride, and Late Blightless.
Varieties having an upright habit
of growth, moderately branched, with
firm, hairy, medium-sized leaves are
much more likely to prove resistant to
late blight than are thoße with large,
smooth, flabby leaves and decumbent
stems.
The evidence at hand seems to
justify the hope that the combined ef
forts of potato specialists working
from both the practical and the scien
tific standpoints may soon result in
the development of varieties of pota
toes combining general excellence with
a high degree of disease resistance.
Cantaloupes.
A recent bulletin of the Colorado
Station reports the discovery by a
local grower of a rust-resisting canta
loupe which promises to be of im
mense value to the Rockyford canta
loupe industry. In this case seed of
the Rockyford variety was purchased
from five different seedsmen. They
were planted and cultivated under sim
ilar conditions. When rust attacked
the field just before the melons began
to ripen, it developed rapidly and soon
destroyed all the vines except those.

grown from the seed of one seedsman.
Many of the hills from this strain of
Rockyford seed remained green
throughout the season and produced
a good crop of melons. Further obser
vations in the muskmelon fields of
that neighborhood also showed that
wherever this strain of Rockyford seed
had been used many hills were unaf
fected with rust, while with other
strains of seed of the same variety
tne vines were all dead.
The investigator selected a quantity
of seed from the rust-resistant hills
and planted them in comparison with
ordinary seed. "On the rust-resisting
hills the melons were hidden under a
healthy growth of vines, and were
large, solidly netted, with thick, firm
flesh, small seed cavity completely
filled with seed. On the rusted hills
the plants were almost devoid of leaves
and the small melons were premature
ly ripe, with thin, watery flesh, open,
large seed cavity, and practically of
no market value."
In tracing back the history of this
Strain of seed it was found that some
years before a seedsman had saved the
first lot from a single healthy melon
taken from a field of rusted vines. It
had therefore been developed by the
simple process of saving seed from
the best melons produced by plants
which withstood attacks of rust when
surrounding plants were destroyed by
this disease. What was thus accom
plished by one farmer with one crop
can probably be accomplished by other
farmers with the same or with other
crops, if they will be alert, while the
crops are growing, to select and mark
individual plants which show excep
tional merit along the lines of pro
lific yield, early maturity, resistance to
disease, or other desirable quality, and
save seed separately from the plant
showing such qualities. Marked va
riations which may be profitably util
ized in this way are constantly occur
ring and are plainly evident on all
farms.
The point to be emphasized is that
improvements in farm crop varieties
nearly always trace back to individual
plants. No one is in better position
to notice these exceptional plants than
the farmer. He is in his fields, gar
den, or orchard, every day, where these
exceptional plants are produced. If
one plant in a rust-infected wheat
field stands up green and free from
the disease, that is a plant to save
seed from as the basis of a rust-re
sistant strain. If one hill of pota
toes in a blighted field remains unaf
fected by disease, seed from that hill
may produce a blight-resistant variety.
If a squash pfcnt is found that is dis
tasteful to the squash bug, seed from
that hill may produce squash vines
which the bugs will not molest.
The Important fact is that some
plants are much more resistant to dis
ease and insect attacks than others.
It is a question of seeing the resistant

farmer has as ereat opportunity for
tfoing this as the seedsman.

STYLES FOR WARM WEATHER.
Fashions for Heated Term are in
Harmony with comiort.
BY BERTHA BROWNING.
The summer fashions have become
qu^e as settled as they are apt to dur
ing the season, and those wardrobes
which are just preparing have the ad
vantage of being exactly what is de
sired rather than an uncertain fore
cast. The woman who enjoys the cool
breezes of her own veranda rather than
the uncertain comforts of some other
may utilize many a summer morning
in fashioning pretty blouses of thin
material and dainty little coats of lace
or lingerie fabrics. It is the detail
which makes up the fashionable ward
robes, and any woman who is clever
with her fingers may make these
small garments or accessories without
>a great deal of expense, and satisfy
her desire lor becomingness and style.
Summer gowns are real summei
gowns this year, and Mistress Fashion
seems to be more in Harmony with
comfort than for some years past.
Waists may be elaborately inset with
lace or embroidered, but they are
simply made and with lacey collars or
low, round or Dutch square necks.
Everyone is wearing elbow sleeves ex
cept those with scrawny arms, and for
them there are sheer undersleeves
which conceal any number of ugly
lines. Guimps, too, are popular fea
ture this year, and may be purchase 1
reasonably in all manner of pretty
styles or be made at home? Some of
the daintiest effects are realized in the
combination of Valencinnes and swiss
or lawn.
The delicately colored slips are ap
pearing again, and under the sheer
j white dresses are quite enchanting. A
white embroidered Swiss over a pink
slip has a deep yoke of Dutchess lace
inlet with Valencinnes. The skirt is
frothy with frills and tucks of the self
material and inset and cross-strapped
with Valencinnes. The belt is of palest
pink chifton ribbon. Small capes are
again looked upon with favor, espe
cially the little mantles which go with
three-piece suits or those of lace or
lingerie fabric which grace thin sum
mer frocks. The return of these is
probably due to the return of the small
bolero which has appeared in all man
ner of shapes and styles, the sleeves
of which often resemble cape-like af
fairs.
The long gloves which are worn with
short sleeves are held up in a novel
way by wristlets of elastic covered
with shirred ribbon and finished at the
top with a buckle or tiny rosette of
ribbon. These are worn just below
the elbow or above wherever the glove
is supposed to end. They hold the
glove in place admirably and are a
pretty addition to the toilette. The fa
vorite color for these bracelets is black,
but any color of glove is matched in
these tiny accessories.
The population of the British emntrp
Is 400.000.000 and the area 11,908,37?
