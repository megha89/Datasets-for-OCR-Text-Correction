The "Maetc Mirror" of Japan,
The "magic mirror" of Japan is a
disk of bronze, usually from six to
eight inches in diameter It is silered
on the front, which is a little conex^
and there is a raised pattern on the
back, which is rather concae The
polished pattern Is generally a land
scape, flowers, animals or Chinese
characters It Is not isible in the
front of the mirror, but when strong
sunlight is reflected from the front of
the mirror to a wall or screen the pat
tern of the back Is isible on the
screen in bright lines on a black
ground Professor W E yrton, F
It S, with Professor John' Perry, F,
R S, was the first to gie the' true
scientific explanation of this magical
effect It seems that the design on
the back alters the conexity of the
front, making it flat— ln fact, along
the lines of the pattern Consequently
the light reflected from the front is
not dispersed at these points of' tt^
design, aud they appear brighter on the
screen— London Globe

How Smith's Friend Got Through
They were out in Kansas about 100
miles and wanted to reach Kansas
City One of them had a pass for
John Smith and wife He was John
Smith all right, but his friend could
liardly pass as Mrs Smith lthough
they were practically without funds,
they boarded the train "Take a seat
in the rear of the car," said Smith to
his friend s~;,Personal,,^»
Then Smith went forward 'and sat
down by a young woman Soon they
were talking like old friends, and the
subject of tickets was brought up by
Smith He asked her to let him see
her ticket It was not of the ariety
tiiat requires the signature of tbe pur
j^haser
? Smith examined it until the con
ductor came through, and then he
handed up his Jpass and the ticket
Pointing to his friend behindVhe said,
"The extra ticket is for him" The
scheme worked To this day the
young woman does not know that she
was once Mrs Smith for a short ride'
through Kansas— Kansas City Times
 Queer Food
 most singular food Is the larae
of a fly ' common in certain portions
of California aud known as ephydra
This insect is found in such ast quan
tities in Lake Mono, Cal, that It Is
washed upon the shores in ast wind
rows and can be collected by bushels
The water of Mono is ery ' singular,
seemingly ery heay and smooth, like
oil, so much so that It resists ordinary
wind and refuses to become ruffled
When the larae begin to appear the
Indians gather from far and near and
scrape them up, place the wormllke
creatures on cloths and racks in the
sun and dry them, when they are
beaten up and husked, looking then
like rice The Indians call the food
koochahbee, and many bushels are
collected at his time That larae are
nutritious Is shown by the condition
of the Indians, who soon grow fat on
the rich diet Many birds are attract
ed by tbe larae and gorge themseles
with the singular food
Thackeray's Odd Ways
"He wrote a ery small, neat hand
and used slips of note paper," said the
late John Hollingshead of London con
cerning Thackeray "These he would
often gather up and put in  his coat
pocket, leaing his secretary at work,
and stroll down to the thenaeum club
Here, if he could get a comfortable ta
ble and was not waylaid by any gos
sip, to whom he was always ready tq
gie an attentie ear, he would pull
out his slips and carry his story a feij
steps farther In an hour or two he
would again cpllect the scattered par
pers and go on to the Garrlck club,
where, if not interrupted, he wquld re
sume his writing This habit of com
posing in publip frightened many of
the old club fogies, who thought they
were being caricatured for posterity,
and no doubt helped to get him black
balled at the Traelers'"

Berwynd's defalcation was only $1,
600, but had he looted the subtreasury
of as many millions Boontown could
not haa been more shocked
It was uot so much the loss of the
money to the Boontown First National;
that was but an incident It was the
fact that Chet Berwynd should hae
been guilty at all For generations the
Berwynds had been among the leaders
of Boon town society, and It was re
garded as a matter of course that Chet
should hae been made cashier and
paying teller when the bank was' Personal
started '
Some of those who had known Ches
ter Berwynd's father refused at first
to beliee the charge, but ill the end
circumstantial eidence proed too
strong to be ignored, and, though Hank
Simmons, the town constable, had a
suspicious moisture In nls eyes, he • led
Chet oer to the little illage lock
up aud left him In a cell, promising
that a rocking chair and other un
prisonffke coneniences should be sent
oer from his own home as soon as
possible Hank had neer forgotten
how old r Berwynd had worked for
twele hours oer his  little daughter
when she had had the membranous
croup, though he bad just returned
from a long ride into the country ,
One did not hae to go back to Chefs
father for acts of kindness s boy
and man Chet had always been ready
to gie his aid to others, with no
thought Of return, and his incarcera
tion was a shock to the community
 Een after the enerable John Hol
lis had explained that there was a
package of fle $100 bills and two $500
certificates which no one could account
for sae Chet, who bad" denied all
knowledge of the money, there were
those who refused to beliee that r
Berwynd's son could be ginUty
Foremost among these was Gertrude
Hollis, who set aside een her father's
WITH  CBY OEBTBTJE BNK UPON THE
SOF
opinion to declare herself openly a par
tisan of Chet, and it was one of the
things that shook her father's faith in
his own judgment Judge Hollis was a
belieer, in woman's intuition 
It was this which induced him to
hurry the trial in the hope that some
eidence would turn up whereby the
accused cashier might clear himself,
and there was none more pleased
when, two days before the trial, it was
discoered that rats had stolen the
package and had made a nest of the
crisp paper, 
Gertrude discoered the nest in a
cranny under the cashier's desk She
communicated her "find" to her father,
who was also president of {bP bank
ft made au insignificant little mass,
this expensie nest; but, while the mas
ticated particles were too small to be
redeemed by the treasury department,
it was plain to be seen that the nest
was composed qf bills The nest was
fluly brought forward at the trial and
was sufficient to acquit
Chester was the only one dissatisfied
with the acquittal, and that eening he
called at the Hollis home Gertrude
met him with an apology for her fa
ther, for whom the excitement of the
trial bad been too much
"It was yqu I came to' see," returned
Chester "?'I want to ask you a ques
tion"
The red flashed into Gertrude's face
There bad been no open courtship, but
it had seemed to her that there was
but one question Chester would want
to ask Her heart beat high, but the
next moment her hopes were dashed
"Where did you really find that
nest?" he demanded
"I told you this morning at the trial,"
Bhe declared 'It was in the little cub
byhole under your desk"
made you look there?" he
asked curiously
"I supposed that I had a right to
feel curious," she sold defiantly "It
my father's bank, and I had heard
of how bills were stolen by rats at a
rious times I thought I would look
around your desk"
"May I see the nest?" he asked curtPersonal
ously "They let you kefp it, did they
not?"
She flushed, but she crossed to t
writing desk and drew from it a small
almost shapeless mass, on the outside
of which were tiny particles, barely

curiously It was all that had stood
between him and prison
"o you know," he said softly, "thai
this looks more as though it had beer

She flung up her head "You dldn'l
say so this morning"
 ''I did not see It this morning," he
protested "The only expert opinion

 "o you mean,", he demanded, "thai

j "I couldn't see you go to jail," she
said, tears trembling on her lashes
'id you think I was guilty?" he dfr

She shook her head "I couldn't think
Personaliat of you,", she said sjmply, "but
things looked so black against, you,
and I remembered stories of mice

feel his quick breath on her forehead

\ She raised her head braely
I "Not because I was sorry"
; "Because you loed me?"
i Her blushes were her answer In a
moment his strong arms were about
Jjer and she had hidden her burning
'nee upon his 'shoulder How long
they stood there neither knew It was
Judge Hollis who Interrupted them
There were new Hues of care in his
face as he came slowly forward from
the doorway
"Chester," he said slowly, "God
knows how I hae beeu hoping that
some day your union with Gertrude
would gie ote the right to call you

With a cry Gertrude sank upon, the

her, then turned to her father
''You are right, judge," be said
"Until this is cleared to our own sat

slowly to the door, to be jostled io

Great Echoes

of the most remarkable echoes in the
world The sound of a blow with a
harnnier on one of the main piers is re
turned, in succession from each of the
crossbeams which support the road
way, and from the opposite pier at the
distance of 57G feet, in addition to
which the sound is many times re
peated between the water and roadway
at the rate of twentyeight times in
fie seconds
n equally remarkable echo is that
of the castle of Slmonetta, a noble?
man's seat about twq miles from
Milan The report of a pistol Is re
peated by this echo sixty times 
singular echo is also heard in a grotto
near Castle Comber, i Ireland In
the garden of the Tuilerles, in Paris,
Is an artificial echo which repeats a
whole erse without the loss of a sin
gle syllable
nother wonderful echo is heard out
side the Shipley church, in Sussex,
which echoes some twenty syllables in
the most perfect manner,

"In the church," says Emerson in his
essay on eloquence, "I call him only a
good reader who can read sense and
poetry into any hymn In the hymn
book" The test is a seere one, for there
are hymns which are wanting both In
sense and poetry The essayist doubt
less intended to call attention to that
charm of a good oice which enchains
attention and Indicates a rare sensi
bility In the reader "The oice, like
the face, " betrays the nature and dis
position and soon indicates what is the
range of the speaker's mind Many
people hae no ear for music, but eery
one has anear for skillful reading"
John Quincy dams was said to be
so good a reader that no man In his
time could read the Bible with such
powerful effect , Mr  Emerson, who
heard the expresldent speak when his
fine oice was broken by age, records
that "the wonders he could achiee
with that cracked and disobedient or
gan showed what power might hae
belonged to it in early manhood"

WHY TXES RE HIGH
Of late years the inquiry has re
peatedly been made by property
holders throughout the countyPersonal Why
are property taxes so much higher
now than they were twenty years
ago? How comes it that while our
assessment roll has increased oer
50 per cent in that space of time, the
tax rate per $100 has a'oo increased?
While this anomaly may be inex
plicable to the aerage property
holder, it is not so much a mystery
to one who has watched the drift of
eents in local politics There has
been a steady change in two direc
tions — namely, one toward increas
ting the expenses of goernment, and
the other toward reducing the ery
material sources of reenue, outside
 the direct property tax We pro
pose in this article to discuss one
phase of the last mentioned proposi
tion The Ledger has frequently
called attention to the fact that the
fees collected by the sheriff, county
clerk aud recorder hae been whit
tled down by legislatie processes
extending oer many years until
they aggregate today a mere pit
tance of what they footed up twenty
years ago Formerly the receipts
from these offices constituted a ery
important item in maintaining the
local goernment; today, howeer,
they cut a ary sorry figure in the
schedule To present this question
in a clear light we hae taken the
opportunity of segregating from the
official books in the auditor's office
the receipts from fees for the years
1879 and 1880, and comparing the
same with the reenue from the
same offices for the last two years—
1903 and 190 The result is shown
in the following tablesPersonal

Thus we see that the sheriff's office
paid into the county treasury from
fees for the two years $88816, and
the clerk and recorder's offices, at
that time consolidated, $68829,
making a total of $1536993

lected were as followsPersonal

For 190 the
totals are 5735 72175 138380
Totals 2 years 8123 8170735 $286970
Comparing the two periods we
reach the following resultPersonal
187980 15369 93
1903 619 8
Loss for latter period 810750 5
From this it will be seen that from
tthis fee question alone the county
has sustained an aerage loss of
$5325 per year Confronted with
 such facts is it a matter of wonder
ment that property taxes hae been
on the upgrade We hae to raise
much more money now to keep the
machinery of goernment going than
we did 20 years ago Therefore re
Jenue shrieled up in one direction
must be more than made up in an
other The real and personal prop
erty is called upon to make up the
deficiency nd let it be remem
bered that to proide for this short
age alone a tax of 10 cents on eery
$100 of assessable property is neces
sary on the basis of the assessment
roll of last year
It will be asked, What is the mean
ing of this shrinkage? oes it mean
that the business of these offices is
falling off? Not at all There is
more work done in these latter days
demanding the payment of fees than
was done in bygone years But the
disgraceful truth must be told, that
the fee schedules hae been ;so
manipulated in the interest of law
yers and political hangerson that
the reenue has dwindled to the
mere ghost of former years The
 history of this crucifixion of our fee
system, and the moties underlying
the cuttingdown process, would
forth an interesting, and at the same
time a shameful chapter in mador
county annals Property owners are
paying, as the outcome of this icious
system, the expenses of ciil litiga
tion; also the cost of probating es
tates that arc well able to pay for
the official time consumed in their
settlement  n  nc readjustment of
the fee system upou a fair  and
equitable basis, the legislator has a
grand opportunity to make a record
that would merit aud undoubtedly
command the lasting gratitude of
a taxpaying community The op
portunity is presented, but who is
bold enough and straightforward
enough to press the issue to ictory?
Letter From Sacramento
The democrats are just experiencing
the folly of endorsing third party
tickets Two years ago in San Fran
cisco they endorsed Harry Bunkers for
senator in the eighteenth district He
was elected and otod as a democrat
during his first session, but this year
he announces that he is, and always has
been, a republican, and will ote for a
republican for sonator He demanded
admission to the republican caucus, and
after a hot fight was admitted, and tho
democratic party now has oxactly tho
same number of members— four— in
both houses
The senate and assembly both offered
the democrats the same patronage as
the majority, and considered them in
all respects members of the majority
In the senate the senators declined to
accept anything more than a stenog
rapher each, but the assemblymen
had not at last reports declined to ac
cept tho gifts which were brought
them by the Greeks The chances are
they will accept, because I see a num
ber of democrats on hand willing to
sere their country for a reasonable
per diem
There will be no bills introduced until
next week, but there are a number
ready to spring us soon as the word is
gien mong those of general inter
est is the one by Esmudillo, giing
back the Yosemito Valley to the con
trol of the federal goernment That
will be bitterly fought, and will attract
much attention The bills to license
the carrying of guns or rides, and for
bidding the sale of ducks or trout in
the state of California, the measure
being in the interest of tho arious gun
clubs of the state There will be a bill
establishing a' fire marshal, whose
duties it will be to examine into all sus
picious fires in the state, and prosecute
those who are supposed to be guilty of
arson There will be bills to improe
the malitia, and seeral bills in the' in
terest of the agricultural department
of the uniersity The uniersity asks
for a new building for the college, a
dairy and an experimental farm
ssemblyman Whiting has bills to
create the office of mining inspector,
and to require mine owners to gio
bonds that they will pay their men "
One of the most important matters
that will come up will be the bills to
proide for banks of deposit all oer
tho state for city, county, and state
funds t present they' hae to be
kept in tho aults of the public treas
urer, but the new law will allow banks
to gie certain approed bonds as se
curity, and when they hae been de
posited with the treasurer he must de
posit his funds with the banker That
will add, it is estimated, $50,000,000 to
the money in circulation in this state,
and will add the interest ' at least 2
per cent on that sum to the reenuos
of the state, counties and cities of
California
Prison reform is attracting a great
deal of attention, and some ery radical
legislation is certain to bo put through
this session in that matter t the last
session of tho legislature tho assembly
created a committee consisting of s
semblymen Prescott (now speaker) Mc
Konney and unbar to study tho prison
question thoroughly and report when
the legislature met" again The com
mittee collected an immense mass of
information from all parts of the coun
try, and Europe, sia, and the rest of
tbo world which they carefully ex
amined, and as a result hae propared
an elaborate report, accompanied by
numerous bills, to carry out their sug
gestions They propose that the prison
system of tho state which is now all
chaotic shall be made uniform; that is
to say that each of the reform schools
and state prisons or penitentiaries shall
be utilized for tho care, of a different
class of offenders Thus Whittier will
be deoted entirely to the needs of a
truant school It will be a place where
wayward boys just starting ou a crim
inal career can go; where boys who
will not attend school can be sent, and
where petty offenders may be pun
ished No older boys, young men as is
the case in many instances now, will be
sent to Whittior under this plan, and
no one guilty of serious crime or a
hardened criminal, een though he be
a youth
lone will be managed on the plan of
the Elmira Reformatory at that town
in New York, which is tho model in
stitution of the kind in tho world
Boys from 16 to men of 30 will be sent
to lone, when there is reason to belieo
that they can be reformed The worst
cases which now go to Whittier will go
to lone under that system
To San Quentin will bo sent the
milder criminals, those who are not
desperate, who can easily be controlled,
who are sent up for milder crimes, as
for instance forgery, etc, first offenders,
etc While to Folsom will go tho des
perate men, the "red shirters" as they
are called in prison parlance
Under that system if a man is too
bad for one place he will go to the more
adanced stage; if he is better than
the grade where he is he will bo placed
where he can reform In a word re
form, more than punishment is the key
note of the committee's recommenda
tions ;Personal  ,
The committee will also present bills
for the enforcement of tho Bertillion
system of measuring criminals, and
will endeaor to hae the authorities
in all the jails and prisons in the state
take such measurements and exchange
them with the other prisons, so that as
soon as a man or woman is arrested it
will be possible to know if they hae
eer been in a California prison before
By extending this system to tho whole
country, and indeed to the whole world
as is proposed by ponologists, a crimital
could at once be detected in any part
of the ciilized wor'd that he might bo
arrested
The committee has also prepared
bills for the creation of the indeter
minate sentence, which means that a
man will be sent to the prison with a
maximum and minimum sentence, and
if he behaes he can get out on the
minimum This of course only applies
to first offenders
The committee would abolish the
present system of haing counties pay
for the inmates in Whittier and lone,
and would place those institutions on
exactly tho same footing as the state
prisons so far as their support is con
cerned It is found that not a few
judges sent children and boys to the
state prisons to sae their counties this
small monthly payment, thus ruining
the youth and adding another con
firmed criminal to the too large number
infesting our state
ssemblyman McKenney is tho chair
man of tho committee on prisons and
reformatories, and among other things
proposes to hae an eening deoted to
prison matters, to which the goernor
and prison officials will be inited, and
when the many questions brought up
may be fully discussed

soon demonstrated that it was far from

keying with it for oer a week trying

Illinois, whero he remained till early
manhood In 1853 he carac across the
plains with an emigrant train, driing
an ox team nearly all the way He had
some exciting experience with the
Indians One morning just as the grey
misty light of cariy morn shot upwards
from the eastern firmament, Indians
stampeded their stock, sending them

when he came to mador county, and
did his first work here for S C

the south fork of the Cosumnos rier,
and just aboe its junction with the

the Hooper mine Tho entire ditch
property was purchased by Hooper and
Hayward, consisting then of the mid

sorice to the state

Bailroad Gossip
The lone and Eastern railroad from
lone to Jackson and Sutter Creek is
slowly but surely being completed, and
those who remained skeptical to the
last moment hae fallen into lino with
the spirit of progress, and aro now
guessing and woudering whore and
when the building of railroads, which
is suro to bring prosperity to the
county, will end Much talk is being
indulged in at present about a new
company that has been organized for
the purpose of building a road from
the mador County Lumber Com
pany's grounds on Sutter hill through
to the extreme eastern portion of the
county t the same time one of the
directors of tho lone and Eastern road
declares that their road will be built as
far as Volcano within a year, and that
the sureyors are already looking oer
the route for that purpose The natural
resources of the eastern portion of the
county are aried and aluable, and
are worth fighting for The only won
der is that the contest has been delayed
so long mador oounty was intended by
nature to be the home of an industrious
and enterprising^people  Her rich de
posits of quartz, immense fields of soap
stone, wonderful beds of granite, large
areas of timber lands and numerous
fertile alleys, all combine to make her
one of the faored spots of earth No
one railroad can strip her of her natural
resources within the next century s
the earth is, sshprn pf its natural
growths the soil is of such a character
that it can be transplanted with the
artificial and made to yield abundantly
Our apples, pears, peache , grapes, and
other fruits, are pf the be§t nd with
the railroad are sure to comethesturdy
men and women, who will take adan
tage of eery opportunity offered Let
the good work go on, and if the con
tending forces cannot settlo their dif
ferences let us hae twp roads ipstead
of pne • Npt one of those now inter
ested in either enterprise would lie to
see their work a failure But this is
not all There is strong, talk of an
electric road from Sacramento into
Plymouth and on through tho fertile
Shenandoah' a,||ey These roads are
being built in many places, and we
know of no better strip of country in
the state without railroad facilities
than this proposed route It would be
a paying proposition and it is suro to
come mador county has stood in
the background for many years The
mother lode belt has been recognized
for its mineral output, but the re
maindor of the county has been com
paratiely an unknown quantity She
is sopn tp feel the wae of prosperity
and rise tp her proper leel God
speed the day when these contemplated
enterprises shall become realities, and
we shall become known and appreci
ated throughout the stato and nation
in a manner befitting our station

High School
 few years ago ye were permitted
tp sepd our children to the district
schools and hae them taught in alj
the branches that wero necessary to
prooure a grammar grade certificate
Many of our children aailed them
seles of the opportunity, and obsera
tion has taught us that our homemade
teachers are second to none But con
ditions hae changed ery much of late
Under the present school law many of
our children are debarred from the dis
trict school at the age of 13 or 1 years,
and all of them when they hae mas
tered the low grade studies, which
barely qualifies them for the most
common aocation of life The rich
man may send his child to the high
school; the poor man cannot In
course of time tho rich man's children
will occupy all of the eminent positions
in life, irrespectie of their mental
qualifications You are aware that
education does not gie mind, but en
ables tho boy or girl to bring out the
mind that is within them with strength
and polish Now, in order that our
children shall all hae equal rights
they should hae, as near as possible,
equal educational opportunities This
we can greatly facilitate by establishing
high schools in each high school dis
trict as the law has proided There
are many reasons why wo should hae
a high school at the door of our gram
mar schools whereer conenient
First, It will be an incentie to tho
pupils in the grammar grades to study
more diligently, that they may enter
the high school young in years To
the greater portion of our scholars it
will stimulate them to higher ambitions
in life These schools can bo so located
that they will be accessible to nearly
eery scholar In the high school dis
trict, and they will not augment the
tax but ery little By all means let
us educate our children

MINING NEWS
rgonaut— lt sounds well to the
passerby to hear the mill on this mine
pounding away on ore that is suro to
yield liberally of the precious metal
It was no lack of ore or confidence in
the merits of the mine that caused it
to shut down about two years ago 
law suit then pending between the Ken
nedy and rgonaut as to the exact
boundary line, etc was the primary
cause fter a decision faorable to
the mine was gien, the labor troubles
were taken into consideration by the
promoters and the time for resuming
operations were somewhat delayed
We now expect to hear of the rgonaut
taking its place again with the fore
most of the diidend producers
South Eureka— ln our article of
last week we stated that the old mill
would be shut down soon alter the new
mill was started up We hae since
been informed that this is a mistake,
and that both mills will be kept run
ning We are pleased to correct the
error, for the more, extensie milling
capacity the greater will be the output
from tho mine The South Eureka is
certainly forging ahead
Treadwell— This property after
being closed down for four months, and
all differences between employers and
employes satisfactorily adjusted, has
been started up again by the owners
with renewed igor  new superin
tendent has been employed, and de
elopment work will be carried for
ward on quite an extensie scale ll
who hae worked on this property
speak flatteringly of its merits
Climax — Superintendent itken
says the prospects of this mine are ery
encouraging The ore shoot has been
worked for a distance of 600 feet—prob
ably the longest continuous ore body
met with on the eastern tier of mines
Considerable coarse gold is obtained
from the batteries at eery cleanup
The amalgam has surrendered from $6
to $8 per ounce Een with a two
stamp mill the mine has been able to
pay its way, and leae a surplus for
betterments It is contemplated to en
large the milling capacity to at least
10 stamps when the ledge in the lower
leel now being, opened is fairly de
eloped
Central Eureka— The Central
Eureka increased her regular 5 cent
diidend again in ecember, and the
directors hae declared a t cents per
share diidend, or $28,000 in all The
stockholders of the Central are fortun
ate people They not only hae a good
property but the management is of the
best, and the output of the min,e oer
and aboe actual running expenses is
distributed among them regularly each
month

London was there Gay chat, bright
costumes, the latest gossip, eerything
rather than the pictures, held the atten

seemed to a slender girl with a clear
cut, attractie face who strolled slow
ly from picture to picture, lingering to
study one here and there, promising
herself to come again' when there were
fewer people
Then suddenly a little cry escaped
her parted lips Was it possible? She
was back in Llandudno again There
was the Irish sea dancing in the sun
light, the green cure of the Great
Ornie, and surely— surely that figure In
white, gazing with shaded eyes out
across the water, was herself Bend
ing closer, she gazed eagerly at the
picture Yes, the face was hers To a
casual " passerby perhaps the likeness
might not be striking, but to her— the
pose, the dress — eerything spoke elo
quently How could it hae happened?
Hurriedly consulting her catalogue, she
found the picture "Hope" it was call

Ed, and the artist's name Italph Law

know the model's name! I saw her
last summer and painted the picture
largely from memory I could neer
find out who she was and neer dared
speak I think I would be bolder now
nd somehow I hae the feeling that
she lies in London"
His friend laughed
"You expect to meet her in the street,
then? nd what would you do— just
go up and ask her to dine?"
"Perhaps," retorted the artist seri
ously The girl, half rising from her
seat, hastily pulled off her gloes and
drew a ring from her finger, then,aft
er a moment's hesitation, replaced it
and turned The artist was standing
alone, his friend haing strolled to an
other part of the room She lifted'tran
quil eyes'
"I will accept your kind initation to
dinner with pleasure," she said dis
tinctly The" man, his face flushing,
sprang forward
"You?" he stammered "You?"
"But we will hae to go at once, for
I must not be out late," she went on
calmly With an effort the man pulled
himself together <
"I am indeed honored," he said, with
a bend of his head
s In a dream he led the way from
the building, the girl talking uncon
cernedly as though it were the most
natural thing in the world, and it was
not until they were seated at a little
table oerlooking the busy Strand that
he dared draw a long breath Would
she anish away? The girl leaned back
and looked at him
"nd will you please tell me why
you did it," she asked— "why you
painted my picture in the first place
and why you exhibited It in the sec
Hls face clouded
"I hope you are not exed But I
could not help painting it To me last
summer you seemed the ery spirit and
incarnation of youth and joyousness
nd then, in fear and trembling, I sent
it In, hoping, fearing, longing, that
through It and somehow I might find
a clew, a trace Judge, then, of my
Joy when it was accepted nd was I
not right?" he cried triumphantly
"re we not here— together?"
The girl was again slowly pulling off
her gloes; his eyes, following her
moements, fell upon her left third fin
ger, with its single diamond The girl
nodded
"Yes," she said, "it's an engagement
ring, but because I was interested in
$he picture I came It is not likely
that wo shall eer meet again, so for
tonight Jet us be friends Tell me all
about yourself, your ambitions, your
plans/ watching him with bright,
sympathetic eyes "I will be glad to
listen"
oninthorno sighed
"There is not much to tell I hae
worked and studied and succeeded a
bit, as you see, and now I hae man
aged to get to London Since the fin
ishing of the portrait I hae been toil
Ing oer studies for the competition
under Sir nthony Frewell This
morning I was most keen about it;
ftow''— his gaze again resting upon her
ring The girl's eyes widened
T3h nthony Freweil! You mean
the" president 6f the academy?"
'•Yes lam asked to a big reception

there tomorrow night, but I doubt If I
go lam not much in the society line
Now I hae told you all Will you nol
in return gl^e me some knowledge' oi
yourself?" he begged The girl hesi
tated Personal,•,_
"I— l am a ery unimportant person
I am sort of a companion— yes, com
panion—to an elderly gentleman, and—
and I do not know when I shall be
married," glancing at the ring "It 1c
because the gentleman is dining oui
that I am free tonight So do let us
enjoy it h, here comes our dinner
You will hae soup?"
The long English twilight was still
lingering when the two issued from
the restaurant The artist, at her re
quest for a hansom, drew his breath
sharply
"nd am I really neer to see you
again?" he demanded The girl lifted
uncertain eyes
"Is it not best?" she asked nd aft
er a moment he answered to their mutt
appeal Personal
"You are right It is best," he said
steadily The girl's face cleared
"nd— and you will go on and work
make yourself famous," she insisted
"ttend Sir nthony Frewell's recep
tion tomorrow night"
"If you wish it nd now goodb'y
Gie the man your own address I will
not listen nd if eer I do accom
plish anything remember that it is
first of all due to you Goodby"
s oninthorne next eening entered
Sir nthony Frewell's house the blaze
of lights and sounds of music fairly
dazzled him t the announcement of
his name the "R " shook him warm
ly by the hand
"I am glad to meet you," exclaimed
the great man cordially "Your work
shows remarkable promise, and I think
it likely— yes, ery likely— that yours
may be the prize deslgu in our competi
tion My little daughter tells me that
she has already met you," he contin
ued "She is not 'out' yet, but begged
so hard to be allowed down tonight
that I finally consented You know,
these motherless girls usually hae
their own way," with a smile
But the artist hardly heard Personal He was
watching a girl, the back of yjhose
head looked oddly familiar s if con
scious of his gaze, she turned, then
came slowly forward Sir nthony
patted her hand
"This is my madcap, and she does
not desere to be here after the
naughty way in which she ran off from
poor Miss Finch yesterday"
The girl, her mouth curling mischie
ously, glanced up at the artist
"I certainly played truant," she ad
mitted "Come, Mr" oninthorne, can
I not present you to some of these
pretty girls?" s  'y "
oninthorne, doggedly persistent,
drew her into the conseratory
"Why— why did you do it?" he de
manded Miss Frewell laughed
"Because I pleased and because— l
knew you all the time and— and want
ed to see if I would like you"
"nd you decided" — coming danger
ously close The girl's breath quick
ened
"I— l haen't decided yet," she re
sponded lamely ouinthorne, touch
ing the now rlngless hand only half
concealed by its lace mitt, gazed in
quiringly
"nd this?"
She had the grace to flush
"That was my chaperon It is an en
gagement ring, my mother's, which I
always wear, though not always on
that hand"
oninthorne's clasp tightened
"h, and when you^ hae decided
about me, when the success that seems
about to be achieed shall hae defi
nitely crowned'my work, may I, dare I,
hope that you will wear another ring
mine?" He was holding both hands
now ini rebuked and ben| Tower to catch
her answer "May I 'put one on the
proper finger, dear?" The girl, her
lashes fluttering, dropped her head
"Perhaps some day," she whispered
ining With John dams
In the 3'ear 1818 Henry Bradshaw
Fearson, an' Englishman, dined with
John dams, second president of the
United States, at the Boston home of
the fine old statesman, then eighty
four years old The Sunday dinner
was as followsPersonal First course, a pud
ding made of Indian corn, molasses
and butter; second, eal, bacon, neck
of mutton, potatoes, cabbages, carrots
and Indian beans; madeira wine, of
which each drank two glasses "We
sat down to dinner at 1 o'clock t 2
nearly all went a second time to church
For tea we had pound cake, sweet
bread and butter and bread made of
Indian corn and rye Tea was brought
from the kitchen and handed round by
a neat white serant girl" Fearson
says further, "The establishment of
this political patriarch consists of a
house two stories high, containing, I
beliee, eight rooms, of two men and
three maid serants, three horses and
a plain carriage"
n ncient Irish Custom
In the district known as "the barony
of Forth," in County Wexford, Ireland,
is to be found a race of hardworking,
industrious peasants, liing in thatch
ed cottages with clean, whitewashed
walls, which by their perfect whiteness
at once arrest the attention of the is
itor These people differ in many re
spects from the inhabitants of the
other parts of the same county and
hae habits and customs peculiar to
themseles When a funeral takes
place two wooden crosses are proid
ed On the way to the cemetery a
halt is made at a certain spot by the
side of the road Here prayers are
said for the deceased, after which one
cross is deposited in a hawthorn bush
or under It The procession then goes
on its way, and after the interment
the other cross is fixed at the head of
the grae This strange custom dates
rrotn time Immemorial, as the great
pile of crosses by the roadside indi
cates

raw troops with which he had to op

The wealthy gormands of Rome cher

Both Horace and Martial refer with
approal to roast thrush, and Oid
recommends "a crown of thrushes" as
a loer's present to his mistress
Thrushes' breasts were one of the in

dish, "Patina aplciana," which also in
cluded beccaflcos, mushrooms, sow's
udder, fish and chickens, rialing the
heterogeneous contents of a gypsy's

Horace relates that the sons of c
tius, to stimulate their appetite for
dinner, lunched on "nightingales of
monstrous price," and Varro tells us
of the aiary of Lucullns, which was
also a "salle a manger," so that the
epicure gratified his ears and his palate

prohibiting the sale In English fairs
or markets of these articles or of pil
lows, "except they be stuffed with one
manner of feathers" It expressly de
nounced the use of such "unlawful and
corrupt stuffs" as "scalded feathers, or
fen down" The last substance is the
same as cotton grass and was eident
ly in great demand as a substitute In

against people who bought fen down
