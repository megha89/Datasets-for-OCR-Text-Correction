JACKSON,' AMAOB COUNTY CALI^OKNTA, FRIAY NOVEMBER 20 1903
TO MOW OWN YANKEES
The Chain Shot Cannon That 'Was
Inented by a Georgian
A double barreled cannon designed to
sweep down whole regiments of Union
soldiers Is one of tho relics of the ciil
war aud Is perhaps the only "shooting
Iron" of the kind in the world
Immediately after w r ar was declared
an iron worker named John Gilleland,
then employed in one of the Athens
foundries, decided that he could make
a cannon with two barrels which should
be more effectie than a dozen of the
usual kind The death dealing inen
tion was to be charged with iron balls
of a nonexplosie nVture, to which was
to be attached  a" long stout chain, so
that when the two*! barrels were tired
simultaneously the balls and chain
would mow down men by companies
The cannon was cast , AVhen it was
entirely finished the inentor inited a
number of his friends to a pine thicket
on a hill on the outskirts, of the city to
see it work The doubTe"barreled thing
was placed in position on the /hillside
and a heay charge of powder rammed
home In each barrel and the chained
balls loaded on top of this The inent
or's friends kept at a safe distance, and
he applied the fuse One charge of pow"
der and ba^l "went off," but the other
didn't ' As the heay ball shot out it
carried with it the chain to the  full
length, ripping and caorting around,
oer and under the pine saplings, rocks
and mud, tearing up small trees and
earth, and finally came circling back to
the cannon which held the other ball
with chain attached The inentor was
struck on one arm by the ball, now
nearly spent, and knocked senseless,
while friends feared to go near, sup
posing that the other barrel might take
a notion to discharge It was some time
before the discharged ball lay inotlon
less near the upturned cannon The In
entor's arm was 'shattered, making
amputation necessary
This was the first and last trial of the
cannon which was to mow down the
Yankees Mr Gilleland lost hope and
interest with his arm, and the cannon
was permitted to remain on tho hill for
many months, but was finally carted
into the city, where for years it did
most effectie duty in celebrating elec
tions and Christmas day By and by the
old death dealer was missed from its
place near the old city hall, and no one
seemed to know what had become of it
Finally, after diligent search, it was
found In a junk shop From this place
it was resurrected, and the city council
made an appropriation sufficient to
hae it mounted and placed near the
Confederate monument, immediately
opposite the goernment building
As She Understood It
A "pretty rosy cheeked country girl
entered one of our large department
stores It was bargain day, and the
crowd was greater than usual She
bad wandered about from floor to
floor, a little bewildered at the magni
tude of the establishment the largest
she had eer seen
Seeing her, a floorwalker approached
and said, "Is snybody waiting on
you?"
"Yes, sir," said the girl, blushing to
the roots of her flaxen hair "He's out
side; he wouldn't come in" — Philadel

THE ORIGIN OF COFFEE
•Why the Berry eflea Production Id
the United States
As to the history of coffee, the legend
runs that it was first found growing
wild in Arabia Hadji Omar, a derish,
discoered it in 1285, 017 years ago He
was dying of hunger in the wilderness,
when, finding some small round ber
ries, he tried to eat them, but they were
bitter He tried roasting them, nnd
these he finally steeped in some water
held in the hollow of his hand and
found the decoction as refreshing as if
he had partaken of solid food He hur
ried back to Mocha, from which he had
been banished, and, initing the wise
men to partake of bis discoery; they
were so well pleased with it that they
made him a saint
The story is told that coffee was in
troduced intothe West Indies In 1723
by Chirac, a* French physician, who
gae a Norman gentleman of the name
of e Clieux, a captain of Infantry on
his way to Martinique, a single plant
The sea oyage was a stormy one, the
essel was drien ont of her course, and
drinking water became so scarce that
It was distributed in rations e CHeux,
with an affection for his coffee plant,
diided his portion of water with it and
succeeded in bringing it to Martinique,
although weak, not In a hopeless condi
tion There he planted it In his garden,
protected it with a fence of thorns and
watched It daily until the end of the
year, when he gathered two pounds of
coffee, which he distributed among the
inhabitants of the island, to be planted
by them From Martinique coffee trees
in turn were sent to Santo omingo,
Guadeloupe and other neighboring is
lands ;  •
The coffee tree is ; an eergreen shrub,
growing, in Its natural state, to a height
of fourteen to eighteen feet It is usu
ally kept trimmed, howeer, for con
enience in picking the berries, which
grow along the branches close to the
leaes and resemble in shape and color
ordinary cherries The tree cannot be
grown aboe the frost line, neither can
it be successfully grown in the tropics
The most successful climate for produc
tion is that found at an altitude of
about 4,000 feet Anything much aboe
this is In danger of frost, which is fatal
to the tree, and when coffee Is grown
much below this it requires artificial
shade, which materially Increases' the
cost of production and does not produce
as marketable berries It Is owing to
this particular requirement that coffee
has neer been successfully produced
in the United States— Success 
MAKING BREA
Biscuit and rolls require a hotter
oen than bread
Bread should rise to twice Its original
quantity before It is ready to bake
The sponge should be set at night if
the baking is to be done in the morn
Ing; otherwise set It early in the morn
ing   ,Personal  ;'
Bread and biscuits should rise in a
moderately warm place, for If too cold
it will be heay or If too hot it is likely
to sour
Milk is preferable for mixing In
some cases the quantity used will hae
to be aried a little, as some flour will
absorb more moisture than others'
A good sponge can be made of one
pint of sifted flour, one cake of com
pressed yeast dissoled in a cupful of
warm water and liquid % enough to
make a batter J It should be left to
rise till light— Exchange ' , j
ebts' ln China
In China one can always borrow
money on the strength of haing a son,
but nobody would adance him a cent
If he had a dozen daughters The
former Is responsible for the dt'bts of
his father for three generations The
latter is only responsible for the debts
of her own husband • , ;

BARS TO MATRIMONY
FEAR KEEPS MANY MEN FROM THE
BLISS OF WEE LIFE
Some Instances of a Lack, of Snffl
' dent Plnck to Take the Fateful
Trip to the Altar— Various Reasons
That All Spell "Afraid" 
"There is a great deal of specula
tion," said a well known lawyer, "as
to why men are so reluctant to marry,
but one reason neer seems to occur to
the speculators, and 'that Is that many
of them are 'afraid to No, I am not
Joking It is a sotfer and well con
sidered statement of fact, for which I
can adduce _as { many proofs as you
want, that many men would almost as
soon think of patting a fierce bull on
the head or facing the midnight bur
glar as taking a trip to the altar
"I remember as a boy an amusing
specimen of this kind of_mQii In lowa
He was a farmer and was as notorious
for his amorous entanglements as for
his ingenuity in getting out of them
when marriage began to loom near
It was said he had been engaged a
dozen times, and though he left all his
fiancees in the lurch he neer found
any difficulty "in getting a successor
One day my father, who was his law
yer, asked himPersonal 'Why don't you get
married, John? It Isn't for want of
opportunities, you know, and it's quite
time you thought of settling down'
" 'Well, sir,' John answered, 'it's this
wayPersonal You see, I like coortlng well
enough, but I can nler summon up
pluck to go any further To tell you
the truth, I'm afeard of getting tied
for life to one of 'em'
; "If you hae heard many breach of
promise suits you will hae obsered
that this wholesome dread of matri
mony is the cause of a good proportion
of  them, though all the defendants
hae not the courage to say so '
"One client of mine had allowed mat
ters to proceed right to the ee of the
wedding day, when he disappeared
mysteriously and was not discoered
for some months The young lady
promptly sued him for damages ' for
breach, and at the hearing the reason
for his conduct came out He admitted
that he was fond of the girl, but sun
dry exhibitions of her temper and Jeal
ousy which he had witnessed  had so
scared him that he simply hadn't the
courage to marry her • 'I meant to
marry her right enough,' he said, *but
when it came to the point my courage
failed me, and I thought It safer to
bolt'
"In another case in which a widow
sued a widower for playing her false
the defendant put in a singular plea It
seems that the widow's family strongly
objected to the match, and as passie
opposition was useless to preent it one
of the sons, a stalwart young fellow,
called on the middle aged wooer and
told him that if he persisted In his suit,
he (the son) would gie him such a
thrashing as would effectually cure
him of any further sentiment 'So
what could I do?' the defendant pathet
ically asked
"The more one sees behind the scenes
the more one realizes that there is often
a great deal to be said for the man who
loes and runs away One of my clients
a few years ago found himself in an
awkward quandary He had engaged
himself to three girls at different times
and, haing canceled his engagements
with two, was on the ee of marrying
No 3  No sooner was his intention
known than the two Jilted ladies threat
ened him with legal proceedings if he
persisted in his proposed marriage, and
the faored lady in turn threatened a
similar fate if he didn't
"Here was a dilemma, for whateer
he did would end unpleasantly How
eer, like a prudent man, he decided to
run the smaller risk Ho pacified his
two former fiancees by canceling his
engagement and prepared Jo face the
music of the third lady
"The motherinlaw is often a fatal
disturber f loe's young dream ' One
breach of promise defendant declared
that he would willingly hae married
the plaintiff only he couldn't stand
her mother at any price, and the pros
pect of haing his married happiness
disturbed by her interference so scared
him that he decided It was more pru
dent to break off the engagement, while
another frail loer actually stated in
court that he was afraid to marry the
plaintiff lest she should 'grow up like
her mother,' whose 'tongue and tem
per' had shown him some of the less
desirable possibilities of married life
"One man whom I defended last year
seems to hae had a constitutional
dread of matrimony He had been en
gaged to the plaintiff no less than nine
years ' Four times the wedding day
had been fixed, and as many times it
was adjourned by his wish Finally
he cried off altogether, and In conrt he
declared that, although he loed the
girl, he felt he could neer screw up
the courage to marry her When he
was asked the reason for his diffidence
he said that he had seen so much of
the unhappy side of married life and
the difference between wooing and
wedding that he didn't feel equal to
running the risk
"These are but a rew from scores of
slnillur cases which hae come within
my own knowledge One man feared
to face matrimony on account of his
fiancee's extraagance, another quaint
ly confessed a horror of his wife's
cooking and domestic gifts generally,
Jt third defendant was afraid to wed
because a distant relatie of his lady
loe had died in an asylum, and so on
But, whateer the cause, you may take
Jny word for it that the men who are
flownright afraid to take wies are le

GRAN JURY REPORT
The report of the grand jury which
appears elsewhere in this issue, is
the most sensible and businesslike
document that has been presented
by a grand jury inPersonal this county for
many years We are free to say
that the body that met last week ap
peared to be  actuated by a deter
mination to do something of a prac
tical nature, and they hae accom
plished that purpose The report is
short; but it is to the point  The
topics treated upqn are few, but not
one suggestion howeer is out of
place, while seeral are of ital im
portance to the welfare of the coun
ty; We note in this report an en
tire absence of that fulsome adula
tion which had become almost ster
eotyped in such reports The jury
was no doubt hampered by lack of
time Called together on Friday,
and with an objection to adjourning
oer Sunday, it was deemed ad is,
able to get through with their labor
Saturday night, and they did so,
haing an eening session for that
purpose Had it not been for this
pressure of timelimit, the disposi
tiori"of the jury would hae probably
been to probe county affairs more
minutely Asit is, they hae un
questionably made a good beginning
in the direction of reform  By ; ' all
odds, the most important suggestion
made by the report is the recom
mendation that persons doing work
for the county upon the roads, swear
to their own claims, and hae them
allowed in their own names The
system of proxy affidaits, the lump
ing of twenty or thirty different
claims in the name of the road com
missioner, who alone figures in the
minutes as the claimant, has been
fought by the Ledger for years It
is not sanctioned by law, its ten
dency is icious and utterly opposed
to public interests We hae no
hesitation in saying that if the result
of_ the grand jury meeting is the
abolition of this abomination — and
it will most assuredly end that way—
it will hae brought about the most
desirable reform that has been ac
complished in Amador county for
the past twenty years, i •Personal
The only argument that has been
trotted forward in behalf of the dis
credited system is that it effects a
saing in the matter of record books
If road bills are to be presented by
the parties actually performing the
work, and separately entered in the
minutes, it is argued the space in
the court house will rapidly fill up
with record books Besides, this
lumping of the bills by the super
isor in each district saes con
siderable clerical labor in entering
up the minutes It is easier to
record one bill presented by a super
isor, than twenty or more bills pre
sented by as many differentjorkers
on the road' ; This reasoning is
specious, jj and altogether unsound
If it is good in road matters, it
ought to begood in other depart
ments Why not the superintendent
of the hospital lump ali the bills
against the hospital fund, and draw
the money, and pay the same to the
different parties entitled I thereto
That would be just as legal as the
adoption of the system in road mat
ters Why not the district attorney
or the clerk undertake to consolidate
all the claims against the current
expense fund in the same way The
plan would sae clerical work, and
also economize in record space and
stationery If it is in order to keep
the taxpayers in the dark as to the
identity of claimants against the
road funds, it ' is equally proper to
conceal the personality of the claim
ants against other funds The fact
is the method is wrong; it is con
trary to law, it is  demoralizing in
its tendency, and no greater serice
was eer rendered by a grand jury
than the recommeudation by that
body that it be discontinued

THE LABOR WAR IN TUOLUMNE
The labor agitators at Soulsby
ille, Tuolumne county, who took it
upon themseles to run the Chinese
out pf that camp hae "struck"
trouble A few Chinamen were em
ployed at*the Black Oak mine in
doig such work as no white man
could be got to do at the same
wages— sl7s per day It was dis
agreeable work, and the pay — al
though as much as the company
could afford— was not such as to in
duce other workmen to accept the
job Two or three union men of the
professional agitator stripe, con
ceied the idea that it was all wrong
to hae these Celestials earning this
pittance They raised the oftre
peated cry of "The Chinese must
go" Their crwn miners' union would
not sanction', the program, so they
took their trumpet tongues to near
by camps and succeeded in gather
ing an armyof about 150 ignorant
sympathizers, and with this force de
scended upon the mine, and by force
and iolence droe or carried the
Mongolians off The affair was
"peaceably and quietly done, 1 ' runs
oue account In their oerweening
anity these leaders— dressed in a
little brief authority — imagined they
were doing great things by this cru
sadePersonal They wanted to pose as indi
cators of the rights of the oppressed
legions of labor They thought with
the union cohorts behind them, they
were numerically strong — strong
enough to take the law into their
own hands It is unfortunate that
instead of trying to discourage the
spirit of defiance, those whose busif
ness it is to guide popular sentiment
into healthy channels hae remain
ed dumb awed by the strength of
the union moement The result is
the mining enterprise which has
been the mainstay of • the place for
years, is at a standstill; the miners
are out of work The boycotters find
their ictory turned, into a defeat,
and that with their sympathizers,
they constitute a ery small minority
in the dominions of Uncle Sam The
state, county, and federal goern
ments are on their trail, demanding
the punishment of the perpetrators
of this outrage upon our free insti
tutions The moement has proed
a boomerang The Western Fed
eration has been seriously crippled
of late by the acts of its rabid mem
bers It should muzzle the fire
eaters or fire them out of its ranks
if it wishes to regain the confidence
of the classes it is designed to help
and defend i

met with a seere fall Monday after
noon It was the first time he had
been 'down to his office for a week,
owing to the damp weather / Monday
afternoon he was sitting on top of the
steps of the hall of records enjoying a
sun bath He got up to get down the
steps He had I scarcely started when
his crutches seemed to slip, and he fell
from the top clear to the bottom His
bead struck the concrete paement
round the well, with such force as to
cut a gash in the skull, from which the
blood flowed freely Assistance was
promptly rendered, and r Gall reach
ed him in a few minutes He was un
conscious for a short time He was
taken home on a cot An examination
showed that his right arm was broken,
and that he has receied, a seere
shaking up His adanced age and
feeble health makes the accident as
sume a much more serious phase than
it would otherwise ;

Grand Jury Report
To tho honorable superior court,
county of Amador, state of California
We, tbe members of the grand jury
duly impaneled at Jackson, Noember
13, 1903, respectfully submit the follow
ing reportPersonal
We ibited the county hospital, and
found it in good condition, with the ex
ception that the main part of the build
ing needs a new roof We found 58 in
mates therein  We would recommend
that the board of superisors hao a
new roof put on the main or old portion
of the building; that they hao screens
put in all the outside duors and win
dows of the county hospital, and fur
nish tbe steward with books and hae
him keep just and correct accounts of
all supplies receied and disposed of at
tho county hospital Also that the
district attorney inquire into and hae
such in mates as should be paying in
mates, pay the rate fixed by the board
of superisors into the county treasury
We would further recommend that
the grounds arofcnd the hospital be
cultiated to a certain extent, to im
proe the appearance of the place and
also be a benefit to tho finances of the
institution
Wo find the present management to
be satisfactory, except in the matter of
being absent from the institution more
than we deem actually necessary"
The grand jury haing obtained in
formation that there are arious saloons
throughout this county frequented by
minors, and liquor obtained there by
them, and haing been informed tjiat
one such place is run in such a manner
that the same is detrimental to the
morals of the community in which it is
conducted in defiance of the law and
the law officers; wo would recommend
that the board of  superisors reoke
the license of all such places
We would also recommend that tho
officers enforce the law in reference to
young men making' their homes in
houses of ill fame
We hae looked oer the books and
accounts of the arious officers of tbe
county and find the same in good or
der, and that the books are kept in
good shape; and find nothing to war
rant the appointment of an expert to
examine the same Personal Personal^' Personal'•' Personal
We counted the money in the treas
ury and found the amouut to be
$32,94088, which corresponds with the
statement of the county auditor  •
The jail was carefully looked into and
found to be in good condition and neat
ly kept We found two prisoners
therein, one committed for agrancy,
and one not committed; the district at
torney awaiting the result of assault
committed by the prisoner before mak
ing the charge
We would recommend that the road
commissioners see to the matter of
haing meu working upon the roads,
each doing eight hours work per day
when working on the same
We would also recommend to the
board of superisors that tho custom
of the road commissioners putting in
the arious items for road work in the
arious districts into one bill, and
sworn to by the road commissioner of
each district be discontinued, and that
each one hae each person performing
serices or furnlshfng material for
roads make out and erify his bill, and
the same be allowed in the name of
such person
We also recommend that the court
room of the supreme court be furnished
with a comfortable set of chairs for the
trial juries
The jury finds that the telephone
bills of the county officers are increas
ing eery month It would recommend
that each officer hae all messages not
pertaining to county business charged
to the party sending or receiing the
same ' Vf
In conclusion, we desiro to thank the
county officers for their uniform kind
ness in furnishing us information as de
sired, and courtesy in explaining ari
ous matters to this jury Personal

THE BURBANK TRIAL IN SHASTA
An Amador County Young Han on Trial
for his Life
The trial of John Burbank, a young
man born and raised in the eastern part
of this county, was commenced in the
superior court of Shasta county at Red
ding last Monday Burbank is accused
of the murder of ora Lemory, also
known as Viola Myers and ora Streu
ber, in a dance hall at e La Mar on
the 15th of JuJr'Tast After fatally
shooting bis' ictim, he turned the
weapon upon himself, inflicting a super
ficial wound on his neck Tho Sacra
ments Bee's special correspondent says
of the proceedings on the opening dayPersonal
The accused, John Burbank, wa
dresssd up in bis best suit of clothes
He had eidently taken particular
pains to make himself presentable His
face was cleanly shaen, and his toilet
had been made out with great care
Ho looks to be in perfect  health, not
withstanding his four months' confine
ment in jail
Four women sat within the bar
They were priileged witnesses Three
of them wore the weeds of mourning
Eeryone was curious to know who
they were The first lady of the four
was Mrs ora Lemory, of Oakland,
mother of tho ora Lemory who was
killed in the e La Mar dance hall by
John Burbank Next to Mrs, Lemory
thoir elbows touching, sat Mrs A H
A Burbank, of Jackson, Amador coun
ty She is the mother of the prisoner
at the bar She is bowed down by
years and grief and pain She has
walked on crutches all her life She is
dressed in mourning, as was Mrs Lem
ory Who can look into the two
mothers' hearts and read the emotions
there? They attend this trial from
different moties — one in her heartloe
praying for mercy upon her wayward
son, and the other asking that justice
may fall upon the slayer of her way
ward daughter
The two other women within the
bar are Mrs Ea Leibhardt and Mrs
elia Joyce, both of Jackson, Amador
county They are sisters of Burbank
The list of witnesses subpoenaed on
behalf of the defense is a long one and
as usual includes a large number of
character witnesses Burbank's par
ents lie in Amador county and from
there were called the followingPersonal Wal
ter Webster, William enend, Robert
O McKean and Findlay Goodman, of
Volcano; Clarence Bradshaw and
Charles Stirnaman of Pine Groe, and
John Barton, Maurice L Plasse and
Nick Ferari of Jackson
Judging from the line of questioning
addressed to the prospectie jurors,
Burbank's attorneys will set up the
claim that he acted in selfdefense in
shooting ora Streuber
One noticeable feature of the prose
cution was that eery man in the jury
box was asked whether he was a mem
ber of anyolabor unioja This is ales
son learned by the Gallanar trial,
where the one juror who faored ac
quit tal is said to hae been influenced
in his decision by the fact that he and
the defendant were both labor union
men Burbank, in this instance, is a
labor union man
Surprising progress was made on
the first day as the twele jurors were
secured by the time court adjourned
for the day
Contrary to tbe usual order in crim
inal trials the testimony of the reputa
tion witnesses was taken first, before
the prosecution opened its case This
was done for economy sake There
were eight of these witnesses from
Amador county, at a cost of $30 each
They were examined at the commence
ment of the trial, paid off, and allowed
to depart
The e La Mar witnesses, who were
on the scene directly after the tragedy,
and took part in the arrest of tho al
leged murderer, told facts that were of
some importance^ They told of how
Burbank came down from the upper
room where he had fired three death
dealing bullets into the body of ora
Struber, and used the wordsPersonal "I hae
killed her, and lam glad of it I did a
good job on her, and a bum one on
myself" After tho killing he had
fired ono shot at himself, but had mis
erably failed to do good work on him
self Witnesses testified that he said
that if it was to do oer again ho would
do tho same thing again
ora Struber was the inmate of a
dance hall She had been liing witb
Burbank off and on, and because she
would not heed his entreaties and
leae the dance hall life to lie with
him, he is alleged to hae taken her
life She lied but four or fie minutes
after she had boon shot, and before dy
ing kissed the lips of tho man who had
killed hey
It is belieed that tho case will be
gien to the jury Thursday eening

A curious experience happened at
the agricultural experiment station a
few weeks ago Nino shoop of the
Persian ariety were sent up there
They consisted of two males and seen
females They were kept in two separ
ate pens ' One night a lot of green
feed was thrown into the pen where
the female shoop were kept Fortun
atoly, the same kind of feed was kept
out of the other pen ' Next morning
all seen sheep were found dead The
fatality is attributed to something in
the feed; the two in the other pen
were not affected in the least Too
mishap settled the scheme to raise this
kind of sheep in Amador county The
two bucks were shipped out this week

Imperial Minstrels Show
On the occasion of the initial appear
ance of the Imperial Minstrels of San
Andreas before a Jackson audience,
Loe's hall was crowded to the doors
last Saturday eening, and that too in
spite of the inclement weather that had
preailed for seeral days All the re
sered seats were disposed of long be
fore the day of the performance, and
there were about twice the number^ of
these seats than are usually resered
The program consisted of minstrelsy
for the first part There were 15 per
formers on the stage, all decked with
ebony frontispieces The tambo end
men were J C Tilden and Gro H
Treat, who were well supported by the
bones, J J Halley and O B Furlong
These were the big four of the show,
conspicuous throughout not only from
the fact of their being scarletcoated,
but also because tho songs and sallies
of wit fell mainly to their lot The
witticisms were ' ery good — seeral
wero new to a Jackson audience at
least— and the coupling of some local
business man with a joke occasionally
was appreciated by a storm of applause
The rendition of tho songs was equal to
many of the professionals, and certainly
the interest taken therein by the
spectators was far greater, partly owing
tp the fact that the performers were
amateurs, and many of them personally
known to tho townspeople* '  Wm
Nuner jr acted as interlocutor, anil
filled the bill creditably The songs
presented were as followsPersonal

The financial outcome was not as
satisfactory The expense of coney
ance and other necessary cost in trans
porting nearly 20 performers was of
course heay, but we are pleased to
say that such was tho interest deelop
ed in the appearance of this company
from Calperas county, that the incomo
was about sufficient to defray all liabili
ties The receipts we understand were
something oer $130,
Labor Trouble at South Eureka
A strike was inaugurated at the
South Eureka mine last Tuesday, re
sulting in the quitting of the entire
force of men — in all between 50 and 60
The strike came about in this way An
accident occurred by which the skip
and cable in one compartment were let
into the sump No one was hurt, but
on the recoery of the runaway skip
and cable it was noticed that some
kinks appeared in the cable, and the
men objected to btine lowered in that
compartment Foreman Mounter did
not insist, and the otber skip was used
for a while We are told that heay
loads were run up and down the shaft
by the tabooed cablo to show that it
was trustworthy and safe, and to satisfy
the scruples of tbo men on that score
No one will blame the minors for re
fusing to take any extra risk in de
scending or ascending a mine, and it is
not reasonable to thin!; that any one in
charge of a mine would ask them to do
60 It appears that one miner was dis
charged, whether on account of the
mishap or not we do not know Two
other employes took up the cause of
tho discharged man, and they were
also informed that their serices were
no longer required Thereupon the
matter was laid before the miners'
union, and a committee waited upon
Superintendent Moore to know j tbe
cause of their discharge He declined
to satisfy them, claiming (he right to
discharge an employe without reeal
ing tho reason therefor At this the
men are said to hae taken the stand
that the; would not return to work
unless the dischargod men were rein
stated This brought on tbe walkout
of the entire force The superintend
ent refused to reinstate, and the men
decided not to recede from thoir posi
tion The mine was brought to a stand
still The men wero paid' oIT Tuesday
eening; the superintendent at the
same time giing thorn the opportunity
of returning to work if they felt so dis
posed 
The South Eureka has been operat
ing for many years, without any recom
pense to the stockholders Assess
ments hae been leied upon the share
holders repeatedly to keep it running
Still, giing employment to between 50
and 60 men, it has cut quite a figure in
the business interests of Sutter Creek,
and tbe immediate ueightjorhood of the
works The community will miss the
money put in circulation monthly if the
shutdown is prolonged Some of tho
stockholders are outspoken in express
ing indifference as to whether it re
sumes operations or not It is hoped,
howeer, that the matter will ' bo ad
justed, and' the mine resume, with the
old or other employes
Injured in a runken Bow
A man named Feretti Ambrogio was
landed in the county jail by Sheriff
Norman the latter part of last week
No formal charge has been made
against him, for the reason that the
outcome of the injuries inflicted upon
the ictim of his assault is yet in doubt
The affray happened in New Chicago
on the 10th instant It seems that
Ambrogio was a miner employed at the
Fremont, and that he was discharged
a few days prior to the 10th Salatore
Battaylia was also employed at the
same mine, and Ambrogio had an idea
that he acted unfriendly toward him
Both men had been indulging in
liquor, and a quarrel ensued on tho
street of New Chicago The upshot of
it was that Ambrogio secured a pieco
of a wagon tire, somo four feet long,
and struck Battaylia in the small of
the back with this formidable weapon
Whether he struck with the edge or
the flat part of the iron we are not in
formed At any rate, Battaylia is
crippled, but not to the extent that
was feared He was around on crutch
es in a day or two after the occurrence
Sheriff Norman and istrict Attor
ney Vicini isited New Chicago after
the arrest of Ambrogio, and obtained
information that put a different phase
on the matter It appeared that Bat
taylia was the aggressor throughout
He started in to run tho mine, or run
out tho managers, and jjlso clean out
the town, because of his discharge He
went to a friend named Bontn New
Chicago and abused him Ambroggio
was standing by, and noticing that
Battlayia kept his hand in his coat
pocket, and  belieing that ho had a
gun, told him to take his hand out of
his pocket He failed to do so, and
the blow with t^e iron b,ar was the re
sult After an inestigation it was
found that Battaylia did not hae a
gun, but had indulged in threats to
kill
Battaylia was arrested, and fined $50
by Judge Roso Ambroggio was dis
charged 
A Handsome Souenir
 We acknowledge receipt of a hand

farewell pf the retiring superintendent,
C B^Riddick, on the ee of his de
parture In this he says that his resig

position of trust in the court house
He sered as clerk of court and deputy
assessor for eight years, and was dep
uty sheriff for a like period He was
afterward elected county clerk and re
corder, and filled that position for four
years He was always prompt and
obliging in the discharge of his duty,
and tbe breath of suspicion ' neer at
tached to him in any way in his long
period of public serice In 1895 he
was united In marriage to Miss Ella

closed all day in respect to the memory
of one who had filled the office of trus
tee and clerk for so many years The
arrangement was for the children to
attend in a body, but owing to the in
clement weather this had to be aband
oned There was a long procession of
mourners, a number from distant parts
of the county, who had long known the
deceased The attendance would ha ye
been much larger had the weather been
less stormy The remains were interred
in the Catholic cemetery, the deceased
being a life long and consistent member
of that organization
AntiSaloon Moement
We are informed that a moement
has been started in lone, with the iew
of taking concerted action throughout
the county, for the purpose of restrict
ing the number of saloons, and increas
ing the license tax Petitions are being
circulated, and it is expected to hae
the same before the superisors at thoir
next meeting These petitions set
forth that the number of saloons is out
of proportion to the population, ' and
the superisors are appealed to pass an
ordinance to stop the further granting
of licenses until the number of saloons
is reduced fully one half; also Jo raise
the license a sum that will secure a
reenue equal to that which has here
tofore been secured from this source;
also, that hereafter a license tQ retail
liquor be granted only on a petition
signed by a majority of the oters of
the precinct in which tho proposed
saloon is located The petition has
been shown to a few in Jackson, but no
effort has been made to press tho mat

Fred Tabeau Meets With a Terrible Ac
cident jon the Road
 On Friday afternoon Fred Tabeau, a
teamster employed by A Piccardo in
hauling freight between lone and Jack
son, met with an accident which, if it
does not result fatally, will disfigure
him for life He was driing a ten
animal team heaily loaded, including
a backaction," to Jackson He had
got as far as Mountain Springs An
other of Piccardo's  teams was a
short distance behind For some rea
son Tabeau stopped the team, for the
purpose of soeing that the load ' on the
back wagon was all right Some one
remarked that it was getting late, and
he would hae to get a moe on to
make Jackson in reasonable time No
one witnessed the accident, and the
ictim himself has not recoered con
sciousness sufficient to explain it It
is belieed, howeer, that Tabeau
struck one of the mules with a stick or
a rock, to hurry them up He must
hae been quite close The supposi
tion is that the mule kicked iciously,
striking him in the head Tho team
ster behind noticed the team start into
a run, and he saw Tabeau lying un
conscious in the road He was taken
to the Mountain Spring house, and' a
doctor was summoned rs Adams of
lone and Endicott of Jackson were
both called The animal's hoof struck
Tabeau oer tho left eye, crushing the
skull and injuring the eye so badly that
it is belieed that it will hae to be taken
out The bony structure around the
socket is also broken Tabeau has re
mained in an unconscious state since the
occurrence He is a young man, under
20 years of age, and a careful, trust
worthy' drier Tho attending phy
sicians are hopeful of his recoery, with
perhaps the loss of the injured eye

MINING NOTES
Fremont— The cleanup at the Fre
mont for the first run, we are reliably
informed, aeraged a trifle oVer $5 per
ton,^ which was aboe expectations
TJ'he stockholders are quite elated, as
the ore was a mixture of rock from the
different leels, and is belieed to be
a fair sample of the quartz The com
pany is putting up fie cottages for the
use of the employes, and other indica
tions tend, to proe that a long and
prosperous career of gold production is
opening out for this propertyT Fie
dollars per ton— though not a high
grade proposition — leaes a good mar
gin of profit, with the facilities for
economical working which exist at this
property
Argonaut— The shaft repairs hae
been completed below the 1200 leel It
is thought that the major portion of
the task  has been completed The
mino is likely to get into full swing
early in the spring if nothing occurs in
the meantime to defer that desirable
result i 
* Good Strike— Tim Hanley has re
cently run across a rich streak of ore
in working his quartz claim on Board
man hill, Volcano Rock of high alues
has been taken out of this claim in
years past The working of the claim
has been intermittent, but wheneer
prospecting has been done to any ex
tent, it has generally responded in the
surrender of high grade quartz

In addition to this complication,, an
other and worse mixup has been 'dis

prior to the death of Frank Frates In
his life time Frates , deeded nearly all

was administrated upon, but the ad
ministration has not been closed It is
now reported that tho alidity of the
proceedings to straighten the title to

question, with the prospect that all
that has been done may hae to be set
aside At any rate the affairs are in
a much tangled condition It is claim
ed that the deeds were in the nature of
a trust, and were held by Mrs Frates

WHEN ONE IS A GUEST
The Pleasures of Visiting and th
uties of the Visitor
It is a pleasing sensation to wako up
in the morning and feel that one is a
gmst Strange wall papers and strange
furniture surround one's bed, and there
is a strange iew out of the window
All the jostling demons of worry, anx
lety and responsibility, whether domes
tic or professional, who stand ready to
crowd upon our consciousness anish
in the unfamiliar enironment We
hae got away out of the claws of the
usual and lie blissfully waiting for a
knock at the door which shall hae an
unfamiliar sound
ownstairs we find new faces, new
pictures, strange books, a fresh stand
point Life has a new saror Wo taste
it eerywhere |'n the atmosphere and
In the conersation, een in the bread
and tho salt Our first sensation is that
eerything depends upon somebody
else It is nothing to do with us what
eer happens But presently the old
truism of our childhoodHhat eery sit
uation in life ha's its duties, coanes back
to our mind, and though with our wak
ing thoughts we cast off those of the
home dweller we must immediately
prepare to take on those of a guost, at
least if we are constitutionally con
scientious, which, alas, all guests arc
not They may indeed be diided by
this conscience test into isiting sheep
and isiting goats
The motto of the conscientious guest
Is Mine Mohl's well known saying, "It
Is a shame to eat another man's bread
and gie him nothing in return!" Such
a one should be a 'Joy to his hostess,
but In the holiday world of hosts and
guests, as In workaday life, good Inten

THE SENSE OF SMELL
The Aborigines of Pern Hae eel
oped It Wonderfully
How infinitely minute must be the
particles that emanate from the object
which the dog is tracking, says the
London Mail Yet the matter is ex
tremely diisible The tenth part of a
grain of musk will continue for years
to fill a room with its odoriferous par
ticles and at the end of that time will
not be appreciably ' diminished in
weight by the finest balance A cubic
inch of air rising from the flame of a
Bunscn burner has been found to con
tain no fewer than 489,000,000 dust par
ticles A drop of blood which might be
suspended from the point of a needle
contains about a million of red flat
tened corpuscles Still, though matter
Is so marelously diisible, the olfac
tory neres are infinitely more sensi
tie Much has yet to be inestigated
with regard to the differentiation of
the points in these neres,so that they
may discriminate with such apparent
ly miraculous accuracy Yet een the
results in the scent of dogs show how
marelously fine is their discriminating
power Our sense of smell, unless in
the trained chemist, is not een so
acute as that of the semlsaage 'The
aborigines of Peru can in the darkest
night and in the thickest woods'distin
guish respectiely a white man, a ne
gro and one of their own race by the
smell Much we hae gained by ciili
zation, but not without some loss to oui
bodily energies and senses Man's re
cuperatie power after an injury is in
the inerse ratio to his social adance
ment Similarly he seems to become
less acute and delicate in the sense of
smell as he fares better and lies more
comfortably The faithful dog puts
him to shame
Greek Noses
We learn that the nose of Socrates
waa not Greek, but such as Greek art
ists usually assigned to satyrs Occa
sionally, as in a beautiful group of a
satyr playing dice with a nymph on a
bronze mirror, they gae satyrs anoth
er kind of nose The noses of the la
dies in the Tanagra terra cotta are of
all agreeable orders of nose, not neces
sarily Greek The chances are that the
Greeks aried as much as we do in
their noses, while the tradition of their
art preferred the conentional straight
nose In the same way the kind of Ro
mans who had their portraits done on
coins and gems were just the sort of
energetic, conquering people who hae
Roman noses eerywhere, like William
of Orange and the uke of Wellington

ANCIENT ISEASE
Smallpox First escribed by Arabs
In Sixth Century
The literary as well as tho pathologic
history of smallpox • presents many
items of ery special Interest All rend
ers of thu clouded annals of the "Mid
ilk' Ages" are acquainted with ths fact
that Arabian writers "were for many
centuries tlie recognized apostles of phi
losophy and physical science— including
the sundry departments of medicine
and surgery— to the arious nations of
western Europe And it is to one of
those, Abu Bekker Mohammed ben
Zoclmrinh (A  830032), the earliest
aud most original of all the great Mos
lem physicians, thai medical science
and medical literature are indebted for
the first recognition of smallpox as a
distinct disease andiits first description
in written language This enerable au
thority Is generally 'known to posterity
as Rhazes, a name which he deried
from Ual, the place of his birth His
original description of this formidable
disease has been made familiar to Eng
lish inquirers through the medium of
r Greenhill's translation In addition
to his obserations on disease proper
the powers of obseration of Rhazes in
physiognomy are demonstrated by such
Items of information as, "A man with
large, ears is stupid, but long lied,"
and in rational therapeutics by his rec
ommendation of the practice of the
game of chess as a cure for melan
cholia The antiquity of smallpox is,
as might well be expected, lost in the
midst of ages, but the definite state
ment has boon made by Arab historians
that it first aiipeared in the Abyssinian
army of Abraha at tho siege of Mecca
in the course of the so called "Elephant
war" of A  5(59 (or 071) The legend
is gien as follows by oue of their, best
historians, TabariPersonal "Thereupon came
the birds of tho seadn flocks, eery one
with three stones, inithe claws two, and
in the beak one; and they threw the
stones upon  them 'Whereer one of
these stones struck there arose an eil
wound, and pustules all oer At that
time the smallpox first appeared and
the bitter trees The stones undid them
wholly Thereafter God sent a torrent
which carried them away and swept
thorn into the sea" Een one of the
elephants, haing entured within the
sacred inclosures, was struck by a stone
and fell a ictim to the smallpox
Among the bitter plants which also ap
peared at that date for the first time,
the rue and colcynth are especially
mentioned— American Medicine

SKILLFULLY ONE, THEY WILL AMUSE
AN MYSTIFY YOUR GUESTS
How to Tell Eery Card In the Pack
With Ita Back Turned Toward Yon
The Thirtyone Trick — A Cleer
'Way to Tell rawn Cards
This undoubtedly is one of the best
illusions performed with cards, as it
not ouly brings the whole pack into
use, but Is also legitimately founded
upon arithmetical principles By this
trick you are able to tell the whole pack
of cards with the backs toward you;
also to sort them after being cut any
number of times in the j mere act of
dealing them out in a row It is per
formed thusPersonal __ k
A pack of cards being distributed on
the table, with their faces uppermost,
they are picked up one by one in the
following orderPersonal 0, 4, 1, 7, 5, king, 8, 10,
knae, 0, 2, queen Repeat the same se
ries of eery thirteen cards Four times
oer will of courscomplete the pack
That the aboe order may be remem
bered, the following words are used as
a guide to the memory and they are
intended to enumerate the cardsPersonal
0 4 1 *
The sixtyfourth regiment beats the
•7 5  king
seentyfifth; up starts the king, with
8 10 8 knae *
eight thousand and three men and
9 2 queen
ninetytwo women
Hence this trick is said to be done
"bywords!" '
The pack being arranged, it may be
handed to any of the company "to cut,"
with the proiso that this operation be
done whist fashion— that is, by taking
a portion of the cards ott in a mass
and placing the lower diision on what
was before the upper one This done
fairly and properly, it may be repeated
any number of times, as the audience
may think fit You then take the pack
and by a feint catch sight of the bot
tom card Haing learned this (it may
be done at a glance, in a second of
time), you hae the "key to the whole
trick Then commence ; it by dealing
the cards out in the ordinary way, but
in thirteen heaps  Haing  dealt out
thirteen, begin again and coer them;
then go on as before When finished
there will be of course four in each
heap Now eery heap will contain all
four of the same denomination, as the
four knaes in one heap, the four se
ens in another, and so on The thir
teenth, or last heap, will be of the same
denomination as the one at the bottom
which you hae contried to see, and,
according to whateer that card is, all
the suits will follow, but in the reerse
order, as the words , aboe Indicate
Thus suppose the eight was the bottom
card Then on dealing them out they
would be in the following orderPersonal King,
5, 7, 1, 4, 6, queen, 2, 0, knae, 3, 10, 8,
and you begin reciting in the mind the
words you use from that passage in the
sentence, working from right to left,
which the card indicates in the aboe
You would sayPersonal 
8 , 10 3 knae
Eight thousand and three men and
0 2 queen 6  4 '
ninetytwo women; sixtyfourth
regiment beats the seentyfifth; np
king
starts  the king with, etc Here, of
course, is your starting point ' 
The same principle holds good what
eer the card may be Any person ask
ing for a card, all four of eery suit
may be found in the same heap and
can be quickly turned up as soon as re
quired with a little practice, to the ut
tur astonishment and wonder of the
company   *
By taking up the cards in the same
order as before, but all of one suit, you
may easily discoer the position of any
one card that is demanded
A fine trick with cards is called "thir
tyone" It is played with the first six
of each suit, the aces In one row, the
deuces in another, the threes in anoth
er, then the fours, fies and sixes, all
laid in rows The object now will be
to turn down cards alternately and en
deaor to make 31 points by so turning
or as near to it as possible without
oerrunning it, and the one who turns
down a card the spots of which make
him 81 or so near it that the other can
not turn down one without oerrun
ning it wins This trick Is ery decei
ing, as all other tricks are, and re
quires much practice to be well under
stood The chief point is to count so as
to end with the following' numbers—
iz, 3, 10, 17 or 24 For example, we
will 'suppose it your priilege ; to com
mence with 3 and your adersary
would, add 6, which would make it 9
 It would then be your policy to add 1
and make 10 Then, no matter what
number he adds, he cannot preent
you counting 17, which number gies
you the command of the trick We will
suppose he adds 0 and makes 10 Then
you add 1 and make 17; then he adds 6
and makes 23, you add 1 and make 24
Then he cannot possibly add any num
ber to count 31, as the highest number
he can add is 6, which would only
 count 30, so that you can easily add the
remaining 1, or ace, and make 31
There are, howeer, many ariations to
the trick
A cleer way Is here gien In which
to discern one or more drawn cards
Turn unperceied the bottom card of a
pack face upward; then let seeral of
the company draw a card Reerse the
pack rapidly, so that the bottom is now
the top card, and thus all the other
cards are turned face upward unseen
by the spectators
Hold' the pack firmly In your fingen
and request those who hae drawn tc
replace their cards In the pack Thus
all the drawn cards will He with theii
faces downward, while all the othei
cards will He with their faces upward
You now step aside, select the drawi
cards and show them to the company

ORIENTAL LANTERNS
How They Are Made and Uses to
Wblch They Are Put
The lantern of the east is as old as
ciilization Its primary object la to
protect the flame from sudden drafts
Beyond this is" the concentration of
light for the conenience of a reader
and, last and least, the regard for beau
iy The oldest form is a perforated
cylinder or rectangular box Of this
type there are numberless arieties, old
and new The ancient ones which hae
been presered are of iron, copper and
brass, nearly all simple in construction
and finish, but a few richly decorated,
Occasionally one runs across, lanterns
made of siler or iory These come
from palaces or temples and in most
instances are richly cared Not in
frequently the perforations are fitted
with pieces of colored glass, rock crys
tal, amethyst and garnet
In China and Japan the traeler's or
street lantern is a feature  This is a
sphere or ellipsoid ranging from six
inches to two and een three feet in
diameter, made of oiled paper, cloth or
silk In Cathay this lantern is used to
show the rank of its owner by the col
oring or inscriptions on its exterior
The humble citizen uses a small affair
in white or red, the official of low rank
a sphere a foot in diameter hanging in
front of his sedan chair, while the high
mandarin employs a huge lantern, re
splendent with his titles in colors, car
ried by an a'blebodied cooly who walks
a yard in adance
It is in house lanternsthat the great
est ariety is found Of these the gen
eral type is a four, fie,' six, 'seen,
eight or ten sided box, whose length is
usually twice its width Each side is
a pane of glass,' plain, ground, frosted
or decorated From the angles hang
pendants of many sorts The frame
work is usually of teak,  but ebony,
rosewood,  mahogany and other woods
are employed Often the sides of the
lanterns are alternately wood and
glass, the latter being coered with
ground designs and the former richly
cared in *cHef or inset with iory,
motherofpearl or siler
Upon the pendants the artificers put
their hardest work Some are made of
colored twads, strung and massed with
fantastic shapes and knots Others
are strings of little bells, which ring
with eery passing breeze Lines of
glittering tinted glass balls betray the
origin of a faorite mode of decorating
Christmas" trees Quaint objects in
gaudy enamel or colored porcelain, con
nected by threads, chains or wires, con
stitute a fourth and ery pleasing

ficial flowers are popular, especially
with the fair sex— New York Post
ANCIENT CITIES
Jerusalem  in the days of Solomon
probably did not contain 20,000 people
Constantinople at the time of its
greatest splendor as capital of the east
ern empire had a population of about
1,500,000
Babylon, whose name has come to be
synonymous with, dense population,
neer had oer 1,200,000 Inhabitants in
its palmiest days, so the archaeologists
declare
Athens, when she led the Greek
states in repelling the Personal inasion of
Xerxes,  had only 30,000 inhabitants,
but Herodotus speaks of this number
as if it was something to boast of
Rome, the mistress of the world, the
great city to which all roads led, "Rome
the Eternal," did not exceed 2,000,000
in population Gibbon, indeed, beliees
that it" had only 1,200,000, and in this
estimate he and Milman agree
