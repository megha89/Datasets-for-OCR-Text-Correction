Bulldose Reporer
"The superisors of mador couny
are no a band of highbinders or
crooks" was he declaraion made by
Lawrence Burke, chairman of he
board, a he meeing las Monday
The asserion was made during a
heaed argmen in which disric a
orey Vicini, sheriff Gregory, Lawrence
Burke, John Srohm,   Eraser of
he board and John Rao, he picure
show man, waged agains he repre
senae of he mador Ledger, who
objeced o graning Rao anoher
free license for operaing a moing
picure show in mador couny on a
plea of poery, when as a maer of
fac, i can be proen ha he picure
show in Suer Creek a presen nes
more han fify seen dollars per
week
The bes films may be secured for
315 a se, and each se runs for hree
nighs In oher words, Rao clears
his film expendiure on his firs nigh's
exhibn Jackson, and hen akes he
films o Suer Creek, and mador, or
lone, and exhibis hem irually wih
ou any furher expense han he ren
of he building, and hiring wha help
he migh feel like employing 
Superisor Fraser informed he
board ha John Rao was presen,
and desired ha somehing be done
abou his fuure license, for operaing
his picure machines in he couny
The license,  collecable by he
couny ax collecor, amouns o I $250
pei>,exhibiion This, ax had been
remied by he board of superisors
on wo preious occasions, and he
showman was gien o undersand by
he board, a' his appearance before
ha body in Noember of 1909, ha
he need no rouble himself any fur
her abou a license, as i was under
sood among hemseles, meaning he
board members, ha for cerain reason
hey would exemp him from all
license ax This was a priae un
dersanding which Fraser and Burke
confessed exised a he las meeing,
a which Rao aended, and re
quesed his free license To be sure
his undersanding had no business on
he minues and was no enered
Sheriff Gregory, was also informed
of he undersanding which exised
beween he board of superisors and
Rao, and did no ask a conribuion
in he shape of a license for he sup
por of he goernmen The exemp
ion worked smoohly unil he Ledger
discoered from he discarded and
smashed up ordinance ha he show
man owed he couny somewhere in
he neighborhood of $500 for licenses,
no coered by he exempion ac,
which Gregory, as official ax col
lecor, failed o collec
Rao arose and confusingly ried o
plead his case, explaining ha owing
o he undersanding which he and he
board had las Noember, hs fel free
from any back licenses which he
Ledger claimed he owed he couny
fer a heary scornful laugh oer
he $500 deb due he couny, he
chairman asked he disric aorney
wha acion hey were o ake in he
maer
Leaning back in his chair, he a
orney asked Rao if he would be able
o gie his show in Suer Creek, and
clear enough money o pay expenses
"No," said Rao, "I could no, I
hae expenses ha are ery heay, as
any showman knows, who is in he
business
"Well," coninued he legal ad
iser, "Then you would be compelled
o close up your show in Suer Creek,
if you did no run your Jackson show
in conjuncion wih i."
"Yes sir," answered Rao Then
forgeing his poery plea, Rao
began railing Sinson of he mador
Record, for criicisms gien his poor
exhibiions a Suer Creek "Why I
shoed $100 under his nose, and old
him I'd be him any amoun he neer
saw beer picures
The Ledger man here informed he
board if Rao could go hrough he
couny shoing a hundred dollars

Terrible SelfIndicmen
In he discussion on he Rao license
delinquency before he superisors las
Monday, i was brough ou as a rea
son why Rao should be le of" free,
ha while he minues of he superi
sors showed ha his free permi was
for six monhs, sill i was priaely
undersood ha he permi was for an
indefinie period— ha, in fac, Rao
was no o pay from ha dae anyway
This secre undersanding was admied
by wo of he superisors, by Rao
and he ax collecor I was pleaded
as jusificaion for nonpaymen and
noncollecion, and roed ou glee
fully as clinching he whole business
nd i was a clincher ruly, bu in a
far differen sense from ha inended
Probably no one of he paries o he
conrac realized he remendous force
of he selfaccusaion To our, mind
his admission is he wors feaure of
he whole diry, disgraceful business
The only meaning we can aach o i
is ha he superisors were deliberae
ly hoodwinking heir employers— he
people —whose business hey were en
iused wih One hing was spread
upon he minues, and a ery differen
hing was clandesinely enered ino
wih he paries concerned The in
ference is ha heir own approed and
and signed minues are no o be ac
ceped as a full and correc saemen
of heir proceedings mazing propo
siion Ciizens of mador, hink of
his, and grasp is full impor if you
can, for we frankly admi ha we can
no For piy sake, how many more of
such priae, secre undersandings are
ousanding ha we wo no of, o be
lined up agains he official record
Bu he record eidence mus preail
Is i surprising ha chairman Burke
should proes "This board is no a
band of highbinders or crooks" There
are many oher poins in his wild ses
sion o be noiced, bu we mus wih
old commen unil 3ome oher ime
How he People Feel
The Ledger is receiing complimen
ary noices all around on he licence
muddle One wrier says 
" I guess hey are all up agains i
now ha your paper has made he ques
ion public There mus be somehing
roen in enmark lam proud of he
sand your paper has aken When 1
hear people rying o down he press,
1 am up in arms agains hem, and
especially when he edior is doing all
in his power o do he couny good
Keep up he figh, Mr Edior Public
opinion is wih you, hear and soul
I is ourageous ha one should be
made o pay license and anoher in he
same business go free"
We may say ha he disric aorney
was waied upon his week, and re
quesed o ake seps for he recoery
of he back license money, and he

would look ino he law, and see wha
could be done His decision is looked

"you d— lile buin, is none of

When he sheriff was informed ha

and he shoued, "you don' pay axes,
wha in he h— do you care"
The reporer no wishing o be con

MOST MOERN HOTEL Im^ WWWH^W^ FOR EVEYBOY
IN SCRMENTO FROM EVEBYWMERChills, near Mount Aukum, fcl Dorado
county. Coscia was known to have
lots of money. Allen had a sweet
heart, but no money.
On the day that Coscia was supposed
to have been murdered, Allen does not
account for his whereabouts, but on
the succeeding days he had plenty of
money, and hired a rig from stables
in Placerville, drove to Shenandoah
valley, got Miss Gussie Thompson, hia
sweetheart, and for several days
there were picnics and dances galore.
Allen treated his friends and footed
the bills.
Later a watch which had belonged
to Coscia was traced to Allen and also
some opera glasses, and Allen told
the officers conflicting stories as to
how he came to have them.
The first week of. the trial is over.
Daily Miss Thompson, who is barely
13, small and handsome, follows
closely the proceedings of the court,
and when ncr eyes meet those of the
prisoner, who usually sits half facing
her, smiles are exchanged. When
there is a word that is derogatory to
her love she frowns. At recess she
comes and sits by Allen's side. None
of this love making is lost on the jury
and it is prophesied that they will never
-hang Allen and break the little girl's
heart. ' '* '
The evidence in the case is circum
stantial. Coscia's body was not found
for "many days, after he . had been
murdered. With some blunt instru
ment he was hit on the back of the
head. - Afterwards his pockets were
rifled and his cabin was robbed. Most
of his money was in banks in San
Francisco, and the murderers got only
about ?20. . .
George M. Thompson, the district
attorney, is prosecuting the case and
C. E. Peters is for the defense. There
are about 100 witnesses in the case
and 80 of these are for the defendant.
About the time Coscia was murdered
there were a number of sheepmen in
the neighborhood of Aukum The de
fendant will try to prove that these
are the men who made away with the
old Italian. Since the murder these
men have disappeared.
Miss Thompson will take the stand
in defense of her lover this week. As
the courthouse was burned last May,
the parlors of the Presbyterian church
are being used for the trial.
Mrs Joseph Wrigglesworth testified
regarding the visit that the murdered
man made at her place on the day he
was killed. He bought some cheese,
tendering a $23 gold piece in payment,
and she returned $19.57. There was
no money on the body of Coscia when
it was found. She also testified re
garding the watch of the dead man, of
his habits and general manner of life.
She, who as postmistress notified
Seeley, who was on the stand so long
yesterday, that Coscia had had no mail
delivered from May 11 to May 27.
This led Seeley to discover the body
of Coscia lying in a pool of blood the
next day near his cabin.
H. N. Vennewitz, a neighbor, testi
fied also. He wa3 on the coroner's
jury and told what was seen and done
at the time. George Cruson was also
on the coroner's jury, and following
along the same line, corroborating the
testimony of Vennewitz. He told of
the terrible wounds of the murdcreu
man, of the broken jaw ar.d false
teeth and of the crushed skull.
D. G. Justice, who is a neighbor of
iiart, foster fathe- of Allen, told how
Allen borrowed $1.50 on April 26th of
him. that he might take in the dance
at Somerset. This wa» but a few days
bafore the murder was committed.
Allen traded what purports to have
Wen Coscia's watch to a son of Jus
tice, the trade being made in the wit
ness' presence. He described the
watch minutely. . John Justice, his
son, was on the stand. He is a lad
about 18 years of age. He told the
same story. The trade was the watch
for a .38 caliber revolver, and was
made on May 22d. On May 27th, the
day Coscia's body was found, the boys
traded back. Since then the watch
has disappeared.
E. F. Smith, a jeweler and watch
maker, who has repaired Coscia's
watch and had written the numbers of
the works and case in his book, was
called. He testified that the watch
was brought to him while young Jus
tice had it in his possession, and he
put a crystal in it. Though there was
a slight discrepancy In one of the
figures, a "5" being found in one
place instead of a "3," he practically
identified the watch. On the dead
man there was found a memorandum
book, and in it both the numbers of
the works and case, and these numbers

Vennewitz and Cruson both testified
regarding Allen's expression when

stance of which was something like,
"Now that I am in I may as well
finish." It is not known what it
meant.

Deafness Can not oe Cured
by local applications as, they cannot
reach the diseased portion of the eat-
There is only one way to cure deafness
and that is by constitutional remedies.
Deafness is caused by an inflamed con
dition of the mucous liuingr of the Kus
tachian Tube. When this tube is in
llamed you have a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can oe
taken out and this lube restored to its
normal condition, hearing will be de
stroyed forever; nine cases out of ten
are caused by Catarrh, which is noth
ing but an intlamed condition of the
mucous surfaces.
We will give One Hundred Dollars
or any case of Deafness (caused by ca
tarrh) that cannot be cured by Hull's
Catarrh Cure. Send for circulars, free.
