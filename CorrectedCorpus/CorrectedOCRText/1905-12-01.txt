By Maud nderson
We wore a week's journey from
Curacon I was siing alone in my
cabin when he capain came down
and old me here was a essel jus
appearing on he horizon o wind
ward, and asked me o go and see
wha she was, for he could no make
her oa a all I wen on deck
mouned ino he mainop, and began
my scruiny
"Well, wha is she?" asked he
capain fiom he deck
"1 can hardly make her ou, bu
1 hink she's a schooner"
"Wha's her course"
"Souwes by souh, I hink; abou
he same as ours" I remained on he
op for a few minues, and coninued
looking a he sranger "She seems
onder of 'he sea han I am," i con
inued, "for she migh hae her op
sails and op gallans, and sudding
sails o boo, all se, insead of slipp
ing along under her lower sails"
The capain made no answer, bu
was looking hard a her wih his
naked eye 1 now perceied hrough'
my glass a whie speck aboe her fore
sail, flapping agains he mas
"Well," I said, "she mus hae
heard me, for here goes her foreop
sail"
 The capain now wen o he com
panion for his glass,' and afer look
ing aeniely a her for a shor
ime, "Wha's ha, 1 ; he asked "Is
ha her square sail she's seing? 1
can' ery well see from he deck"
I looked again "¥es, 'is her
square sail s I'm alie, she's
changed her course, and is bearing
down upon us!" Bu by his ime
he capain had mouned he rigging,
and was sanding beside me; he was
eyeing he disan essel keenly
fer haing apparenly saisfied
himself, he asked me o go wih him
o he cabin, as he wished o alk
wih me alone We descended o
he deck,' and 1 followed him o he
cabin He moioned me o ake a
sea, and afer carefully shuing he
door— 
"1 raher expec," said he, "ha
fellow's a pirae"
"Pirae," I cried in alarm
"V'es, 1 say pirae, and I'll ell you
why In he firs place, you see, he'd
no business o be sneaking along in
ha do lile sor of way, as when
we irs saw him Whoeer, ha had
any hones business o do, would
allow such a line breeze o go by
wihou showing more canas han
a powder monkey's old breeches o
cach i? Nex, ! you see, wha he
mischief has he o do wih us, ha
as soon as he's clapped eyes on us,
he mus aler his course, and be so
anxious o ge ou his square sails?
gain, he looks jus like one o hose
imps of mischief, wih his low black
hull and all raking mass  No' use
alking; he only hing is, wha shall
we do? The Parick Henry ain' a
Balimore clipper, _ and ha 'ere
blackguard will jus walk up o' us
like nohing I we le 'em aboard,
i's mos likely we'll all walk he
plank, so we'd beer ry o keep 'em
ou We'e only go an old rusy
carronade and wo sixpounders, and
1 don' beliee here's a ball on
board, we came off in such a hurry
There's wo muskes and an old re
gulaion rifle down in he saeroom,
bu hey ain' been Hied  I don'
know when, and I'd as lief sand afore
'em as behind 'em Bu our snip's as
handsome a looking craf as you'll
see; and couldn' we look wickedlike
now, and ry o frighen ha cu
hroa rascal?"
1 confess I was a firs saiied a
he capain's opinion of he srange
sail; bu his cool and colleced mann
er impressed me wih confidence
i his managemen, and 1 old him
ha he knew bes wha we should do,
and 1 would second him as well as 1
could He walked up and down he
cabin wice; hen rubbing his hands
ogeher, as i pleased wih bis own
idea — •' 'Personal
"1 hae i," he cried; "I'll jus go
on deck o pu hings inPersonal order, and
in he meanime you'd' beer amuse
yourself looking ou your pisols, if
you hae any; for i he wun' be con
en wih a look a us, we'll hae o
figh" 1 hurriedly ook my fowling
pieces and pisols from heir cases,
for 1 forunaely had boh; and
hough 1 somehow refused o allow
myself o beliee here would beany
occasion for heir use, ye 1 loaded
hem wih ball, and in each  of he
pisols pu a brace This done, 1
wen on deck, where I found he
capain surrounded by his crew, ell
ing hem his suspicions and plan of
acion 'f?Personal%
"Maybe," said he, "wo'll hae o
figh If hem scoundrels hae a
mind o ry us hey'll send a boa
on board, and I wan o know if
you'll help me o keep hem oil
You see, i's mos likely hey'll make
you walk he plank wheher you figh
or no, if hey ge on board ; and 1
calculae, if you do jus as I ell you,
we'll frighen 'em"
There was a heary "y, ay, sir!"
o his shor and pihy harangue
"Thankee, hankee, boys," said he
oapam "Now, we'll show anoher
sich of oanas, bu jus seem o ake
no more noice of ha fellow, han
if we didn' see him; if he does ry
o come aboard, hen we'll show 'em
wha we can do"
The crew were soon busy, in obedi
ence o bis orders, cuing up spare
foreop gallanmass ino logs o
abou four fee long These were
immediaely puinnd black, wih a
round spo in he cener of ' one end
so as o bear a olerable resemblance

old sixpounders, were placed one
a each por on our deck, fie on a

and he logs hrus ou nbou'a loo

op of he longboa, which was fixed
beween he fore and main; mass,
and he carronade, or foureen
pounder, was hoised up \ ' These
hings being arranged, he capain
wen below, and he crew musered
in knos o wonder and alk of wha
was o be done  ;ix
In he meanime we had been sand
ing on our course, and had no shif
ed or hoised a single sail, bu were
as if perfecly regardless of he
schooner No so wih her, howeer;
for besides a large square sail and
square opsail on he foremas, she
had run ou small foreopmas sudd
ing sails, and onward she came before
a prey smar breese, yawing from
side o side, a one momen sinking
sern foremos in he rough of he
sea, as an enormous wae rolled ou
from under her, and a he nex forced
headlong upwards by is successor,
while a broad whie shee of foam
spread ou around her, giing beaui
ful relief o he jeblack color of her
bull, esifying how rapidly she was
going hrough he waer 1 could
no help hinking of he' capain's
expression, for she cerainly did
"walk up o us like nohing;" and as
here appeared no much ime o lose,
I wen down o he cabin o assume
my weapons The capain was here
arranging some papers, and a bole
was before him, ino which he had
pu a leer
"Maybe," said he, "somehing'll
happen o me; or if hem 'ere blood
hirsy wreches won' be cheaed 1
shall be he firs o suffer; and
naural enough oo, for all he mis
chief hey'll suffer will be by my
orders, jus because l didn' like o
be oerhauled like an old arpaulin
by eery rascal ha chooses o say
"Heae oo n he high seas Bu
neermind, only should you escape,
jus drop he bole and leer oer

1 had neer seriously considered
he probabiliy ha 1 migh also be
killed in an approaching ligh, for 1
hough ha he capain inended o
hrow open his pors and  show his
sham guns ha he schooner would
ake frigh Bu when he began o
alk abou aeah in such a serious
srain, 1 began o feel ery uncom
forable; and no being naurally a
warrior, 1 "wished myself anywhere
else han on board he Parick Henry
There I was, howeer, wihou a
chance of escape; and I j suggesed o
he capain ha i , would be as well
for me o pu a leer ino he bole
also, in case of any acciden o 'boh
of us, which was agreed o; and we
arranged ha if eiher suried, and
had opporuniy, he leer of he un
forunae should be safely forwarded

Scarcely were he words ou of his

a ery small margin per year is he

s he ciy is laid ou, howeer, we
canno see ha one dollar would be

The bulk had moed ou ino he

Wha could i be?  dog! 
my hear sank I hough of he

Bu as I urned my head a few hun

hrew boh arms around me and

7 Monroe Street Chicatf o. UL, U. S. A.A TALK WITH SECRETARY WILSON.
Secretary Wilson, as the official
head of the great family of American
farmers, views -with some consider
able satisfaction the abundant crops
which have blessed almost every sec
tion of the country.
"The harvests have been heavy," he
said, "and the farmers -will make
more money than in an average year.
The prices on farm products will be
lower, but the crops will bring the
farmers, nevertheless, more money.
Living should be cheaper, too. The
hay and grain crops have been enor
mous—probably record breakers— and
meat as a result should be more plen
tiful and cheaper. I say it should be.
The producer and consumer are so far
apart, and so much goes on in between
these two principals that it is difficult
to say just to what extent production
afreets the cost of actual consumption, i
A great deal goes to the middleman;
too much, I believe. It is a long and
devious pathway from the farmer to
the man who eats the things which h«
has grown. I gave out a statement
here the other day intimating that the
local Washington dealers were charg
ing in certain instances too much, and
a dealer camp 4it me with a wrathy
assertion to the effect that I did not
know what I was talking about* and
that he made a profit of only forty
per cent. " : v ,
Co-Operation in the South.
"I have been watching the South
with a great deal- of interest," con
tinued the Secretary. "They have ac
complished more in effecting an or
ganization down there to bring the cot
ton producer and consumer together
than has been attempted with any
other of our great agricultural produc
tions. The cotton crop, is a big one
this year .though not by any means a
record breaker. The grass and hay
crop is probably the biggest we have
ever had; our corn crop is probably a
record crop and our wheat crop is one
of the very largest"
"That is the order of Importance Of
these crops?" "■'
"No, I should put cotton third in Im
portance — grass, corn, cotton, wheat;
though of course, our meat animals,
taken as a whole, are more important
than any one. Why, the poultry pro
duction alone is worth 400 million dol
lars, a year — as great or greater than
the value of the wheat crop. We will
undoubtedly export some very fine
hogs this year — choice corn fed hogs.
Pork is our greatest meat export. A
quarter of a billion dollars would
hardly cover our animals exported this
year. I fancy, probably amounting to

send our hogs abroad and are eating
more mutton, veal and beef." ■--,
"The present condition and the fu
ture outlook for the American farmer
is a good one then, Mr. Secretary?"
. "Yes, things certainly look well,
generally; yet I believe we are very
near to a sort of agricultural crisis—
hardly a crisis perhaps, but an import
ant and radical change. The farm
hands everywhere" are leaving the
farm for the factories. Wherever
there is any manufacturing you will
find this to be the case.
The farmer has pretty nearly reach
ed his limit. He is doing about all
he can do with his hands and with the
most improved labor-saving farm ma
chinery worked by- good horses. This
bad condition on the farm Is going to
affect production and prices, and that
very shortly. It is impossible to say Just
what the effect will be, but a change
is coming. The farmer must have la
bor, but with the prices of farm pro
ducts as they are now, he can not meet
the wages offered by the factories;
therefore the farm hands are gradually
shifting toward the centers— the towns
and the cities." ••':
Mr. Wilson Not a Theorist.
"I would like, Mr. Secretary, to have
a message from you to the American
farmer for the coming year." . "
"Oh, I can never discuss things in
an academic way," remarked Mr. Wil
son, with a smile. "You will have to

refer to some of our bulletins."
"Well, I mean a few words of per
sonal advice to the farmer, to an indi
vidual American farmer regarding hia
work for next year."
! "No, I can not do anything with these
hypothetical cases of higner farm edu
cation."
"Well, then, what should a man do
with the manure which accumulates
on his farm?"
"He should put it on his land," re
plied the Secretary, now thoroughly at
home; he should take it out on the
land at once and not let it accumulate;
haul it out and spread it on as fast as
it is made. The ground will get the
good of it."
."Won't the ammonia evaporate and
the fertility be lost to the soil?"
"No, it has been demonstrated by
careful experiments that the hauling
out of manure is the best method. It
will go down into the grass roots. It
will not lose the ammonia because am
monia is produced by bacteria and
these bacteria flourish only under three
conditions, moisture, heat and oxygen.
There are three classes of bacteria
which must operate upon manure be
fore it is available for plant food. The
ammonia bacteria attacks It first; it is
th<»n converted by other bactpria Into
nitrites, and, lastly, by still other bac
teria, into nitrate, when the roots of
the plant can then take it up as food.
THE KITCHEN GARDEN
More Than Two Thirds of the Living
of a Family Can Be Raised.
If the farmer's wife could induce
her liege lord to contribute tue same
care, patience and labor next spring
to the kitchen garden ' which his
grandfather did during his day, there
would be perhaps a consideraule gain
in the household's economy as well as
much satisfaction developed for the
housewife. The old folks insist that
even with the greatly increased vari
ety and excellence in fruits and vege
tables, due to many plant generations

of selection and breeding by the seeds
men and scientists, the kitchen
garden on an average is not so well
planted or tended, has less variety,
and on the whole is much inferior
to the same institution in the "good
old days" when grandfather was a
boy.
It is an oft repeated argument, in
every farm journal that more atten
tion should be given to the garden;
that fully two-thirds of the living for
the farmer's family, however large,
can. be produced from a good garden,
These Are

TypicaL
and that with thoroughly rich soil,
good seed, a well planned rotation of
garden crops and a medium amount
of hard work— a good wheel hoe will
reduce this last expense— a very small
area will produce a very large amount
Not only should the table be sup
plied from spring to late fall, but
large stocks of staples should be
saved for winter use. Of course
every farmer stores in his cellar po
tatoes, turnips, pumpkins and other
coarse crops, but there are many
others equally good and almost as
easily cured and kept which no
longer contribute to the winter's table
and have been supplanted by cheap
canned goods, in the long run expen
sive and usually very inferior.
Limas for Drying ;Pick Them Green.
Take, for instance, lima beans. If
these are picked and shelled when
green— the same as though for imme-
dlate table use— and then dried in the
sun, they will constitute through the
winter a delicious and wholesome dish
almost equal to the fresh bean.
The same applies to green corn, which
our grandfathers will tell vs 11 was a
staple winter produce, also easily
dried In the sun, having been cut from .
the boiled cob at "roasting ear" stage.
And, among others, okra or gumbo
makes equally as good soup In win
ter as when fresh in summer.
When it comes to canning and pre
serving, there is little real comparison
between the home canned product
and bought goods. It time is con
sidered as money, canned tomatoes
can be bought probably cheaper than
they ' can be grown and canned at
hotnel But how about the results?
If the farmer's wife should go
through the ordinary canning estab
lishment she would probably conclude
to do every speck of her own can-
ning hereafter and avoid setting on
her table sour green fruit, artificially
colored and sweetened with coal tar
products. ■ Y.Z" » • -■ -~ -'■■■'
With the supposed degeneration of
the individual farm garden, it is in
teresting to note that the professional
market garden, as an industry, has
tremendously increased.
The farm gardens, . "market * gar-,
•dens" 'and truck gardens" of today
are the producers of a multitude of
"miscellaneous vegetables" almost un
known fifty years ago. In the census
of 1890 the large increase in garden
products ■ was ' recognized, and ! a : sys
tematic count of their bulk and value
was made. It is possible, therefore,
to make a ten-year comparison of the
increase of such products, and this re
cords the remarkable Increases from
190 per cent to 400 per cent in the five
several divisions of the country. Tha
North Atlantic States had -a well de
veloped industry in "garden products"
before 1890. which accounts for the
relatively low increase. However, 190
per cent in 10 years, while the popu
lation increased only a trifle over 20
per cent, is amazing. '
