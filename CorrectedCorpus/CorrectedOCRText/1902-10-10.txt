CATCHING A THIEF
An Old Method Utilised by a German
Officer In China
Thirty dollars was stolen at the Of
ficers' club in Tientsin, China,' and the
wesibera of the dub resoled, if possi
ble, to catch the thief Personal- '; b'Z '~"C
- ; A'- German  captain olunteered to
manage the affair, and the first thing
he did was to summon all the natie
serants of the club He then said to
themPersonal
"Some' money has been stolen here,
and lam looking for the thief I shall
Ind him in an hour, not before, since
I seed that much time in order to get
instructions from a celebrated magi
cian In Germany"   \
~ An hour later, all the serants were
again summoned, but this time into a
dark room, In the middle of which
stood the table on which the, moneys
Stolen had been laid
"Each of you, now," said the officer,'
"must go up to that table and press on
It first your right and then your left
hand, and when that is done yon must
•raise your two hands oer your head^
and step Into the next room"
The serants did so, and as tbe last
one stepped into the adjoining room
the officer followed , him, and after
looking for a few moments at the many
uplifted hands he pointed to one man
and said, "You are the thief" The
Chinaman to whom he pointed nearly
fell to the ground with fright and ad
mitted his guilt and promised to make
restitution
Very simple was the method adopted
by the officer for discoering the cul
prit While the natie serants sup
posed that his spirit was in Germany
in communion with the celebrated ma
gician he was carefully smearing the
surface of the table In the dark room
with fat and oil, which he then black
ened by means of soot The innocent
serants naturally pressed their hands
on the table, according to his lnstruc-'
tlons but the culprit, though super-
Btitios did not do so
As a result, while the uplifted hands
of all the others were coal black, his
were of a natural color, and thus his
guilt W3S clearly proed— etroit Free

KILLE THE SPIER
eadly Influence of a Small Magnet
JJJf the Insect,
An experiment made by a scientist
to tost the influence which a magnet
will hae on a spder is of interest
The magnet employed " was a small
steel one of the U shape, the legs of
which were about two and a half
Inches long by one-half inch wide and
one-sixth of an inch thick, the distance
between the poles  being about one
fluarter of an inch
Haing noticed a small spider actie
ly running along his armchair, he
brushed it' off upon the carpet, where
it began to rnn, but was somewhat im-;
peded by the roughness of the fabric,
lie now slid the magnet along the car
pet, following after the spider, till the
ends of the poles were itliiu a ,quar
ter of an inch of it The animal, 'with
out being touched, almost instantly
stopped, and on withdrawingPersonal the mag
net the spider continued on his jour-,
ney
The experimenter then placed the
magnet within half an inch in front of
the spider, and, withdrawing it slow
ly, the latter followed- it in eery direc-
Won which the magnet took, both in
»UralgHt and circuitous routes
Gradually, howeer, tne spider be
came so strongly magnetized as to be
immoable for seeral minutes, the
magnetic influence seeming to lose its
further power On withdrawing the
inugnejPersonal altogether the ppWer began |q;
recoer somewtiat "" " j
The scientist ultimately placed a
tumbler oer the spider and the' mag-Personal
net, coering them both completely,!
and at the expiration of seeral min-'
utes the spider, after a struggle to es-;
cape from the strong 'influence which
the magnet, exercised oer" it, was!

The Word Flattery
At first sight there would appear to'
be little connection between flattery;
and the wagging of a dog's tall TPti
In nearly all the northern language the
same word signifies both, and flattery, 1
Is certainly deried from the word slg-,
nifying to wag the tall In the old'
Norman flagra signifies to flatter andPersonal
also to wag tbe tail In anish logre
la to wag the tail, and loger for een is'
to fawn on one In utch yleyden Is

After dinner comes the promenade
along the esplanade, "a charming walk
around the old battery oerlooking the
prison, says the Catholic World - Our
way borders ' the behind us lies
the city,' with "its Moorish towers, its
red tiled roofed-back of It rises Mount
Ancon; to our left is the little Indian
hamlet of La Boca, at the mouth of
the Rio Grande, and the green hills of
the Andes in the distance; along the

turn to crimson, green and gold its
islands; the stately palmetto trees that
fringe the white beach and
far, away the "ancient towers", of San"

beautiful city of old Panama
The story of this beautiful city, old
Panama, "reads like one of the ro
mances from the "Arabian Nights" that
so delighted our childhood Its houses
of aromatic wood, hung* with costly
tapestries, adorned with paintings and
sculptures that a king might eny;
its 800 magnificent churches, with their
serices of slier and gold, their fres
coes of pearls and precious stones; its
pleasure gardens'; its broad drieways,
chief of which" was the king's high
way, oer which the royal horses bore
the treasures to Puerto Bello and the
ships ready to sail with them, to Spain'
Intothe; midst of this Asiatic splendor
came Morgan and his buccaneers, and
this struggle, one of the most memora
ble on our continent, the first of white
r gainst white, led to the destruction of
the flower of Spanish chialry and the
capture of Panama So pass the glo

SWIMMERS' CRAMP
It' la Not  So Very anceroua •* the
Victim Will Keep Cool
If swlmmoi-H could be trained to keep
cool under  all , circumstances, there
would be comparatiely little drown
ing among bathers and summer pleas
ure seekers Cramp is usually assigned
as the cause when some good swimmer
drowns But cramp ought in reality to
be nothing serious Usually is" affects
only an arm or a leg or maybe only a
band or foot Any moderately quod
swimmer can keep afloat with one arm
or een without the use of that, >yet
good swimmers drown often as a result
of cramp If such fatalities were ana
lyzed, they would be more properly
classed as drowning from fright and
loss of nere This comes from the fact
that eery one is taught in childhood
Jo fear the water and cjimeg" as  a
grown man and a Bwimmer to fear
cramp' The aerage opinion is that
the man who is attacked when swim
ming in deep water Is as good as
drowned ' Therefore, when a swimmer
feels a leg or arm begin to cramp he is
frightened in most cases entirely out
pf his, wits He loses his head, begins
to splash and* paw arid struggle and
then goes down
What the swimmer should remember
is that he can keep afloat with ery,
ery little effort if he will turn on his
backed keep his chest inflated," U i$
thePersonal simple matter of floating, -which
eery  swimmer knows and finds ery
easyMf the^wlmmer will keep cool
and float, the cramping limb will fre
quently relax after a little and he will
flpd himself as well a^ eer— Qudpg;

A GREAT PEACH CROP
THAT WHICH GREW AROUN NEW
YORK IN THE YEAR 1678
Apparently the Lmdou Fruit Wti
; More Abundant on Manhattan I•I •
 land Than Anything Else Except
Bad Barbados Ram
fi    •-*"''
Books Of trael usually contain s
ast amount of matter that Is unim
portant and a good deal that to untrue;
besides not a little that is uninterest
ing, and the old traelers who wrote
about their oyages to New York tar
nished few exceptions to the rule ;
 Tantalizing, therefore, Is the diary f
an obserer who isited these shores
in 1679; who had a reportorial Instinct
for the important, the»true and the in
-teresUftgf-whose Journeys "coered tb»
entire- territory now 'known as tbe
Greater New York; who wrote fully
and graphically of all be saw, and
whose obserations hae all come down
to us, with the exception of some thir
ty pages describing New York city at
the time of his isit  Exactly that
which would now be most aluable is
lostPersonal but, from what remains, we can
learn a good deal about the New York
of those days '  •  - ' •*_
Jaspar ankers is the writer whose
impressions' of _ New York hae thus
been lost to the world, and in what
has been presered of his writings the
chief thing that forces its attention up
on the reader Is the magnitude of the
peach crop in these parts j during the
year of his isit He was a religious
enthusiast, the leader of the Labadists,
a sect that flourished briefly on three
continents toward the close of the se
enteenth century, and his oyage coml
panion was a minister, of the same
sect ; • "
But there Is little of this in his diary
against a great deal of what they ate
and drank, and on occasions when
they went to the little church In the
fort where the custom house is i now
the fact is mentioned with some apolo
gies, one serice being attended "In or
der to aoid scandal and for other rea
sons" und others' because "my com*
panion Is endeaoring to learn the lan
guage"  
But on the ery day of their arrial
in New York, Sept 23, 1679, we begin
to hear of the eatables and drinkables,
especially the peaches,  Personal  ; - -
 ','He first took us to the house of one
of his friends, who welcomed him and
us and offered us some of the fruit of
the country," ery fine peaches and full
grown apples, which' filled, our hearts
with thankfulness to God - This fruit
was exceedingly fair and good and
pleasant to the taste, jniicb' better than
that lp 1 Holland' 01? elsewhere, though
I beliee our long fasting and craing
for food made It so agreeable After
taking a glass of madeira we proceed
ed As we walked along we saw In
different gardens trees "full of apples
of arious kinds and so laden with
peaches and other fruit that one might
doubt whether {here more leaes)
or fruit on them 1 hae neer seen in
Europe in the best seasons such an
oerflowing abundance' When we fin
ished our tour and had gien onr
guides seeral letters to  delier, we
returned to his father-in-law's He re'
galed us in the eening with milk,
which refreshed us much  We had so
many peaches set before us that we
were timid about eating them, though
we experienced no ill effects from
therp,"  • •"--,
And the next day, Sunday, the rec
ord opens with thisPersonal- -
"I was surprised on waking to find
my comrade had already dressed him
self and breakfasted npon peaches^ 1
So It went f ery day * Toward ' the
end of the week they crossed the ferryPersonal
(for less than half a cent apiece) to
Long Island, where the people made
them "ery welcome, sharing with us
bountifully whateer they haeU
Whether it was milk, elder, fruit or to
bacco, and especially, first and most of
all, ' miserable rum, which had been
brought' from Barbados and which Is
called by the utch 'kiU-deil' These
people are ery fond of it, and most of
them extraagantly so, although it la
yery dear and has'a bad taste" '
' But on Long Island, as elsewhere,
the peaches were as good as the rum
was bad
"It Is impossible to tell how many
peach trees we passed, all laden with
fruit to breaking down and many of
them actually broken down' We came
to a place surrounded with such trees
from wblcl) sq many had fallen' off
that the ground could not be discerned
and you could not put your foot down
without trampling them, and notwith
standing such large quantities had
fallen off the trees still were as full
as they could bear The hogs and
other animals mostly feed ou {hem, 1 /
The peaches in Harlem "were as plen
tiful and still more delicious When
they went up to the north end of Man
hattan island, we find this noticePersonal
"Before we left (Harlem) we did not
omit supplying ourseles with peaches,
which grew in an orc}iar4 along the
road, Tbe whole ground was coered
with them and with apples, lying upon
the new grain with which the orchard
was planted The peaches were the
most delicious we had yet eaten"
But they need not hae taken the
precaution mentioned, for een after
crossing ' Spiiyten uyll they found
more peaches than eer
"We came to a road which was en
tirely coered with peaches We asked
the boy why they left them lie there
and did not let the hogs eat them
Hff answeredPersonal "We do not know what
to do with them, there are so many
The hogs are satiated with them and
•jjrill not eat any indrei' JPrpm this we
may judge of the quantity of them"—

"Come In In the morning, and -the

there before  -, - -'/
'"Let me tell you a story," said the
president as he motioned to me to re
main "I „ was liing in lowa, and
three city lots composed the capital
that I looked to to gie me a start in
business' I held on to them for a long
time while working for $35 a month
In a real estate office until they had

ii MltM 1t is closing time now,' he said,
'and you had better not make your de

"'Charley,' I said, for I knew him
well, that is ridiculous  It is a half
minute before closing time, and I in
sist that you take my deposit I don't
want to be robbed of all that I hae on
earth before morning',, ;
" 'I will fix it for you,' he said as he
gathered up the money aiuj bankbook
and disappeared jin the  ault with
them In a minute he was back, and
I was astonished at his actions J

he continued, "where \\ will be safe,
and in the morning you can make tbe
deposit If you want tOt 1 '-  "V
'Next morning the bank's failure
was announced
Personal "I hurried to Charley's house, which
was near by, and asked him abqut the
bank i j* li  - " ? !
" 'Yes, i,t has failed and won't pay a
cent' he said 'Just fie minutea t>e*
fore you came in with your money yes
terday the directprs decided not to

out no Information until business hours

poultry depends upon their care and

For Goernor
GEORGE C PAREE, of Oakland
Congress, J N GILETTE, Humboldt
A Caminetti gae utterance to
some ery foolish remarks in his
speech Saturday ui»ht He not
only proclaimed from the housetop
that some mysterious whisperings
had been made about a certain
criminal transaction, thereby setting
the whole couoty agog to know the
nature of the whisperings alluded
to, which concerned a candidate of
his own party, and which would no
doubt hae remained in possession
of a small circle of tattlers only had
they not thus been thrust into tbe
full glare of publicity; but he made
some reflections upon tbe present
assessor, J Marchant, which we be
liee he is unable to substantiate
He told his hearers that discrimina
tion was made in faor of the large
property holders, and against the
small taxpayer; that one mine, for
which an offer of $300,000 had been
refused, was assessed at a nominal
figure He left his hearers in the
dark as to tbe particular mine re
' ferred to, and for that reason alone
the charge is unworthy of credence
or notice After some inquiry, we
hae been informed that the old
Eureka mine at Sutter Creek,' which
has been idle for twenty-fie years,
is owned by Mrs Hetty Green of New
York^is probably the property re
ferred to This opening plea from the
democratic side is a fair illustration
of their tactics Why mask the at
tack by indefiniteness? Why select
a dormant and perhaps worked-out
mine, owned too outside the state?
Why thus make it impossible to
either erify or disproe the story?
Why did not Mr Caminetti  present
his proofs, if he has any, before the
board of superisors in an applica
tion to hae the assessment" in
creased? Is he not aware that a few
years back an attempt was made to
boost this  property on the assess
ment roll before the board, which
was then democratic, and the board
ery properly refused to interfere
JT The truth is, the assessment roll
of Amador county has been in
creased during the past four years
of Mr Marchan t's term of office in
the sum of about $500,000 in round
nmnbers, by far the heaiest increase
in one term that has been made
within our knowledge The first year
of Marchant's term the assessed al
uation was swelled to the tune of
half a million dollars It is well
known that this increase was not
' due primarily to any actual rise of
alue, but rather to an effort to
equalize the burden of taxation, by
raising town property and produc
ing mines It was the only system
atic effort eer made by an assessor
to facetthis difficult problem And
now comes the democratic speaker,
at a time when only one mine in the
county is on a diidend-paying basis,
and tries to make party capital by
adocating increased assessment of
the mining industry, upon which,
more than all other interests com
bined, tbe prosperity of Amador
county depends
A few weeks ago the Ledger asked
its cotemporary to explain why the
superior judge of this county was
absent from his post of duty for two
 months in the year 1900, and did not
return in time to naturalize seeral
persons who desired to ote that
year, although he was receiing a
salary of $3500 per year to remain
here and attend to the duties of bis
 office No answer has yet been
made, and we now also ask why the
superior judge ' of this county was
absent at different periods of time
during his eight years' incumbency,
which in all aggregates seeral
months, when receiing pay to be
here, and 2 compelling persons who
had business before his court to go
 to the expense of goingto San Fran
cisco or elsewhere to procure his
serices, seeral instances of which
could be gien Much stress seems
to be laid by the supporters of Judge
Rust on the fact that his opponent
did not return to this county im
mediately after the legislature ad
journed after his pay as an assembly
man had stopped, but they are silent
when the question of Judge Rust's
many absences from the county
while his pay was going on, are men
tioned The assembly journal shows
Fred L Stewart missed but one day
during the session while under pay
from the state, and neer did au as
semblyman from this county sere
the people more faithfully He has
lied in Amador county from in
fancy, being here long before Judge
Rust eer came Was educated in
its schools, and left the cpunty in
1833 to obtain employment so that
be could put himself through the
State Law School in San Francisco,
and after graduation be came' back
to lone and opened an office, and
practiced there continuously  until
he came to Jackson in 1900 to take
charge of the practice of attorney
McGee, while Mr McGee was in
Europe Mr Stewart has been a
registered oter of this county since
he opened a law office in the county,
is still the assemblyman from this
county, and proposes to continue to
make Amador county his home It
is to the credit of Mr Stewart that
this is the only objection they are
able to urge against him for the
office to which he aspires His
ability, his character, and his legis
latie record cannot be attacked , •

A SUCCESSFUL SALE
The Power of an Adertisement When
It's Backed up by Facts
The Red Front store has adertised
through the medium of this paper a
sale, 1 that was to begin on Monday last
Those who witnessed the rush at its
doors on Monday morning,, hae con
inced themseles' of the power of
printer's ink
Of course, an adertisement alone is
not sufficient when there is no body to
it Nice words are all right, but they
do not bring the desired results unless
they are backed up by facts People
like to trade only with those that do
what they say - Personal
The wide circulation of this paper,
and the honesty of The Red 'Front's
force hae helped to make their "sea
son opening sale" a success
On Monday, October 6th, they
opened the store at 5 o'clock in the
morning and closed at 11Personal30 p m The
whole day long large bundles were
going- out of the store' The es
tablishment was crowded to its full
In whole, they hae done on that day
a bigger business than the entire week
preious to the beginning of the sale
Those that hae now for the first
time gien a response to their "ads,"
hae left the store with the satisfac
tion that it is really "Jackson's Cheap

Great Register
The number of names on the great
regiSter of Amador county is 3256
against 3166 on the register of two
years ago This shows an increase of
90, which, on a basis of one oter for
eery four persons, would indicate an
increased population of 360* It is prob
able, howeer, that the Increase in the
electoral roll is partly owing to a closer
registration of oters The candi
dates for office -would naturally take,,
and in fact hae taken, an interest in
getting eery man on the  oting list

Case ismissed
We mentioned last week that S A
Jones, late of the Jackson Herald, was
arrested in San Francisco on a charge
of beatlug a board bill due Mrs Smith,'
amounting to $60 Constable  Kay
went to San Francisco specially to ar
rest him, and brought him back to
Jackson and lodged him in jail The
constable could not do otherwise The
district attorney haing  ordered the
warrant of arrest to issue, it was his
duty to sere it and bring his prisoner
to Jackson to await the further action
of the court Jones was brought back
two weeks ago next Sunday, and being
unable to gie bail, - he was lodged in
jail, and was there until Thursday last
The only object in iew, as the sequel
shows, in his arrest, was to endeaor
"to get him to pay the board bill and
costs The scheme turned out an ex
pensie fai'ure There is a law which
proides that any person who surrepti
tiously leaes for the purpose of beat
ing a hotel-keeper, etc, is guilty of a
misdemeanor We shall not inquire
into the question of whether the law
was or was not applicable to the case
under discussion Instead of scaring
Jones into paying the bill — een as
suming that he was able to pay it — it
nered him to stand firm He "got J
W Caldwell to attend to his case
After trying to get the case set for
trial, without aail, a writ of habeas
corpus was sued out, which was set for
liearing- yesterday morning This
brought tho matter to a focus Before
the time set for hearing, the, habeas
corpus proceedings were dropped in
the superior court, and the case dis
missed in the, justice court, and the
prisoner released Jones was confined
in jail eleen days He was boarded at
public expense during that time
Furthermore the costs of court and
constable fees will amount to something
like $40, and the county treasury ' will
no doubt be called upon to foot the
bills  This comes of trying to collect a
debt by criminal process If the mat
ter was undertaken with the iew of
meting out punishment for a crime, the
query arises, 'Why was the case dis
missed by ' the prosecution without
trial? The defendant has been turned
loose 150 miles from home, without
means to get back to the place from
whence he was forcibly brought by
criminal process Mrs Smith can ill
afford to lose the money, and we hope
she will get it But she realized that
keeping- the debtor in jail would not
help the matter -  It was a disastrous
moe all round

Examiner regarding the Gillette meet
ing in Jackson It stated that a torch

had to be abandoned for lack of inter
est, and a lot' of other stuff equally
false The settled policy of democracy
this trip seems to be to try to belittle
the republican meetings and - magnify
democratic- gatherings," and thereby
coney ttio idea that the republicans
are lukewarm, while democrats are
enthusiastic In Amador county, the
reerse is the case If the tactics re
sorted to here are a sample of the
methods pursued throughout the state,
the Lane managers must be depending
more upon the efficacy of hot air to
elect their candidates than the strength
of the men before the oters So far
as the campaign has progressed ' in
Amador, there can bo no comparison
between the enthusiasm of the repub
licans, and the dullness of the demo
cratic meetings They are eidently

GILLETTE MEETING
The Campaign Auspiciously Opened
by Eepublicans— Big Turnout 
The Hon J N Gillette, republican
candidate for congress, addressed the
citizens of Jackson in Loe's hall on
Monday eening-,  and receied 'an
oation that was flattering to himself
and a credit to his party friends It
was a practical answer to the efforts
which had been made only two een
ings before by the' democratic gather
ing to array section against section,
and interest against Interest in this
district It told plainer than words
could express that the oters take
no stock in appeals to prejudice
They are not to bo carried away from
the real issues by demagogic tactics re
sorted to by tho speakers of the party
without a policy Ihe hall was packed
to oerflowing There was twice as
many oters there as graced the prei
ous meeting, and standing room was
all monopolized Bonfires blazed in
the street, and a generous use of giant
powder in the way of salute, while the
Jackson band enliened the town with
music The hall was tastefully deco
rated by members of the Jackson club,
assisted by seeral ladies' In front Personal of
the stage was displayed the portrait of
Lincoln, while the rear was deco
rated with a large picture of William
McKinley, supplemented with a bounti-
ful display of flags and bunting,' and
flowers ;
The meeting was called to order by
r C A Herrick; as chairman of the
county committee, and C H Mc-
Kenney was then elected to preside,
and in a few appropriate, words ac;
knowledged the compliment, and an
nounced a long list of ice-presidents,
who were called upon to take seats
upon the platform
The Oneida glee club, comprising fie
young men who are employed at the
Oneida mine, was next introduced, and
sang a taking campaign song, about
Pardee - It was greeted with a j storm
of applause, and an encore demanded
J N Gillette was then introduced as
the speaker of the eonidg ' Mr
Gillette is making - his canass, alone
He is unattended by any other speaker,
and if local talent is not secured to help
out the eening, the burden falls ex
clusiely upon him - This was the case
in Jackson It was, howeer, no draw
back, as the man from Humboldt is a
host in himself While it cannot be
said that he is a magnetic orator, be
gae a plain, straightforward, honest
talk, touching the issues inoled He
stated that he was present at the meet
ing- Saturday, and - felt it incumbent
upon him to refer to some of the re
marks which he had heard He said
the first congressional district was , by
far the largest district, territorially
considered, in California It was one
of the largest in tho United Stated It
embraced mountains, and forest and
alleys, and was perhaps the richest in
natural resources in the state \ Its in
terests were diersified A consider
able portion of the district was deoted
to the mining industry, while pastoral,'
agricultural, and lumber interests were
also large, j Mr Ford had stated that
because he lied in the mining county
of Neada, Be was therefore in position
to understand the wants of a district
like this better than a representatie
from a non-mineral, county  What
are the facts  Mr Ford was born in a
cow county, so was be (the speaker)
Mr Ford was educated for the legal
profession, so was he' His opponent
moed to Neada county, and he to
Humboldt/ Mr Ford had neer done
a day's work in a mine, neither had he
He strongly denounced the claim that
because of -his residence he was' not
able to represent all the" Interests of the
district In- the legislature he had
charge of the bill appropriating $250,000
to aid the mining interests, particularly
of Neada county, and it was passed'
He owed his nomination to the support
gien him by Neada — the roost im
portant gold, mining county in the
district ' • •
He spoke at length; about the trust
issue, upon which the democrats were
laying so much b tress What had the
democratic party done to sole the
problem  When the anti-trust bill was
before congress, Introduced by a re
publican member and supported by re
publicans, the democrats oted against
it, and defeated it The first step in
the way of curbing- monopolies
known as trusts was opposed by demo
crats Only one-eighth of the pro
ducts pf the country were now pro
duced by the trusts The republican
party was able to deal with,' and could
be depended upon jto deal with these
combinations when it becomes  nec
essary l _
' He spoko on tho tariff, and showed
clearly how the nation had prospered
under the republican policy- When
eer the democrats had control, a tariff
for reenue was adopted, depression
and hard times' were the result Full
employment, good wages, ' and  pros-!
perity had returned with tho return to
power of the republicans and a pro
tectie tariff Mr Gibson on Saturday
night admitted that the tariff had
something to do with the general pros
perity preailing, and yet the demo
cratic state' platform recently adopted
denounced the republican tariff" system
and demanded a tariff for reenue only
In California during tho past year, 3 the
money in the saing banks had in

EMOCRATIC RALLY
The First Meeting a Frost— A Tarn*
Affair Throughout
-The opening of the 'campaign^ in
Jackson from a democratic standpoint,
took place Saturday eening 1 , at which
time tbe candidate for congress in the
first district, T S Ford, and others
were announced to address tbe people
in Loe's hall ; At the appointed hour
the seating capacity of the ball was
filled, the majority being non-oters—
women and children J L Sargent
was selected as chairman of the meet
ing, and half  a dozen ice presidents
were selected to form the background
of the platform ' Personal After a few", remarks
by the chairman, T S Ford, the con
gressional aspirant, was' announced
We were unable to be present 'to hear
his remarks, but from all that we can
gather from those who did hear him
he failed to impress the audience as the
possessor of any of the attributes that
go to make up the lie congressman
always on the lookout for the interests
of bis constituents'
' A Caminetti was the next speaker
By the time he got the floor the oting
strength of tlie" audience was nearly
doubled by the adent of the 'members
of the;republican_club,  who, had just
adjourned  from a business meeting
Mr Caminetti was not at his best He
had no theme to discuss except  the
personalty of the candidates, and 'he
did riot confine himself een to that
numerous subject, ;* but Personal branched off
seeral times, to exhibit his usual spleen
and good/judgment by attacking 'the
Ledger and its editor /Somehow the
Ledger under its present management
has always been a lie issue with demo
cratic stumpers in Amador county Be
predicted that Lane would be the next
goernor of California,* and at the same
time told the audience that he was at
the head of the democratic committee
that had charge of the campaign - He
wanted the people to ote for Ford be
cause he had rendered him assistance
when he (Caminetti) was making his
canass for congress years ago  He
had traeled with him,' at his own ex
pense, and he was grateful to him for
it, and hoped the oters would show
their gratitude by oting for him also
Another plea made for Ford was that
be was from a mining county This
was a mining district, and should be
represented by a mining man from the
mining section, who, would, according
to his specious process of reasoning,
know more about the needs of the dis
trict than one from elsewhere  By
this kind of argument our townsman
and manager of the campaign for the
"terrified," would knock out Hum
bold t — the most populous and wealthy
county in the district— because iiFdoes
not happen to hae large quartz mines
within its borders The speaker next
tackled the local ticket Sargent
ought to be elected because he was a
former school teacher and from Ama
dorcounty Judge Rust should be re-
elected because ' he was fastened - to
'Amador county His adocacy of U S
Gregory was unique He informed his
hearers, most of whom bad probably
neer heard of the matter before, that
it was being whispered around that the
reason why the sheriff did not capture
young Gates for the hold-up at Pic
pardo's, was because of priate con
siderations He was not explicit, but
left his hearers to get at the bottom of
the matter by indiidual inquiry In
adocating John Mathis for assessor,
he intimated that the present assessor,
Marchant, faors the mine owners and
wealthy taxpayers, to the detriment of
the small property holders He cited
a case within hi 3 knowledge where a
princely sum was offered for a mine,
and the same was assessed at a mere
nominal figure He again forgot to
mention the mine or the owners We
beliee the local democracy would do
the cause of its candidates more good
by muzzling Caminetti for the balance
of the campaign For instance In ex
tolling Gregory, he remarked that as a
lawyer he wasthe hardest man he had
eer run against in the practice of his
profession in the criminal cases That
was no doubt a statement of fact The
lasFcrlminal case  in which Caminetti
appeared as attorney for defendant,
and indeed the last trial bad in the
superior court in this county, was the
Macquarrie case,' and the testimony
elicited on that occasion fully sustains
the orator's opinion, but not the argu
ment for his re-election based thereon
W M Gibson was the next speaker,
and his harangue capped tho climax,
He is a glib talker, and the only at
tention paid to him was on account
of the wild and intemperate nature of
his remarks - He said he was here in
early days, and had a iid recollection,
although at that time only a "kid," of
a scene which, took place on the main
Street' pf Jackson jn which a tree and" a
rope played a conspicuous part This
reference to mob law and iolence was
characteristic of his speech through
out  He said men were of two classes —
the broad-minded men and the narrow
minded men It was soon manifest to
his hearers which class he belonged to,
Certain iews on the subject of educa
tion which he had read in the Ledger
that day didn't suit him, and he ex
pressed the opinion that a man holding
such ideas ought to be run out of the
community A -broad-minded man is
Gibson? If a man failed tq come up tp
his line pf thought, he was in faor of
shipping him tOßOroo other community
That is the extent of his notion of
freedom of speech and of the press
What a political walkoer the demo
cratic party would hae if the iews of
this intolerant adocate could only be
enforced He next tackled the great
strike in the anthracite coal regions
He eulogized President Rooseelt for
trying to settia the matter; eulogized
president Mitchell, the representatie
pf the strikers, for the terms pf cpm
promise which he offered, and con
demned the mloo owners because they
did not settle the dispute At this
juncture the audience began to melt
away Many were so thoroughly dis
gusted with the Incendiary  tendency
of the utterances, that they left They
were not wining that their presence

THE OL RELIABLE
POWER
Absolutely Purer
THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE
as countenancing such rabid talk We
are informed that this platform
ornament went on to discuss the trusts
and other Personal eils from, a democratic
standpoint, incident, to the present un
paralleled prosperity Personal of the United
States, and declared that the people
were bound to hae redress from the
existing wrongs— that if they-could not
get it by " theywbuld eentu
ally by "bullets" This is a free
country "It is perhaps ineitable that
the ery freedom which constitutes our
crown of glory will always be abused
by agitators ; of the" Gibson jj pattern
But that such persons should' be em
ployed to "stump in the interest of a
national party passes comprehension
From a partisan standpoint the repub
lican party ought to be grateful for the
aluable aid gien by such orators
But | how a candidate for a seat In
the national legislature can, by ac
cepting the serices of such extremists',
and thereby tacitly endorsing the
sentiments oppressed, expect- to win
the otes of intelligent American citi
zens, absolutely trips our understand

CALLING UPON A FRIEN
fhe "Way In Which Two English A*
tors Once Paid a Visit
Here is "an amusing story of Messrs
Toole and Brough, the English comedi
ans | Haing appeared conjointly in a
drama, "earer Than Life," In which
they wore ery ragged, woebegone cos
tumes,' they isited the well known
artists - Fradelle and Marshall to be
photographed in their rags While
waiting /'between the plates" Toole,
tho was fond of a lark, suggested to
his brother' comedian to sally out and
call upon a certain mutual acquaint
ance, who would be horribly shocked
at receiing isitors in such a garb
Brough at once assented, and, popping
on their battered hats, out into the
street the pair slipped and made for
the house of their friend Of course
the neat housemaid and the neater
Buttons were horrified and declined
een without being asked to purchase
matches or the like
"I axes your pardon," said Toole in
an assumed tone "You're making a
slight mistake We want to see your
master" j And he mentioned the gen
tleman's Christian name and that of
his wife
"We hae important business with
him," chimed in Brough
- The girl's face wore a dazed aspect,
and she saidPersonal ''Master neer sees the
likes of you at his house He's most
pertlckler, ain't he, Charles?" appeal-
Ing to the page "You must be making
a mistake"
''Ob, no, we ain't!" responded Toole
with supreme graity "But I'm sor
ry William"— the Christian name of
the gentleman— "ls out I haen't got

ble among his rags, "but tell your mas

PENNY POSTAGE
The Incident That Led it, it* Estab-
lishment In England
Many years ago, when Queen Vic
toria first began to reign, It cost nine
pence to 6end a letter from one Eng
lish city to another In those days the
postage was not paid by the sender
of the letter, as Is now customary, but
by the receier So, of coursej there
were many poor people who could not
afford to pay nlnepence when then
mail arried, and it often happened
that they were obliged to forfeit the
letters - •
One day a man named Rowland Hill
was riding on the outskirts of a city,
and he saw a postman bring a letter to
a young girl and demand ninepence
for it The girl took the letter, scru
tinized it carefully and then handed it
back to the man, saying she could not
afford to pay f he postage Thereupon,
Rowland Hill, being a kind hearted
man, rode up and Insisted upon paying
It himself" When the postman had
gone, the girl confessed to her bene
factor that the fejter was from her
Jper, and to aoid paying nlnepence
on'eery letter he made certain marks
on the enelope which she alone could
decipher ' 
Personal"Put," said,, Rowland Hill, J "don't
you kjaow "you  are ' doing something
yery dishonest in flius cheating the
goernment?"
The girl admitted she did, but there
was no other way to do
Hill rode away and meditated oer
this little incident, and his farfamed
Idea of "penny postage" was the re
sult At first he was laughed at by
eery one, but be fought braely and
finally was rewarded  by s,eeing bis

a man who was there at the time, "the
steward was all but stupefied one noon
at seeing the ex-president slide In at
the kitchen door as though escaping
from some one ' ; • '
*• 'I am sorry to trouble you,' he said,
as though asking a great faor, 'but
may I hae a little corned beef and
cabbage?'
"'Why, certainly,' the steward re
plied; 'but shan't I send it out to you
in the dining room?'
"'No,' he answered; 'I'll eat It right
here if you'll let me sit down' ;
"So a place on the rough board table,
where the cook had been fixing the
meat, was cleared, and Grant drew up
a stool and set to, and the way he
got away with that corned' beef and
cabbage was a caution When he had
finished, he laid down  bis knife and
fork with a funny sigh of satisfaction,
put one hand on the steward's shoulder
and saidPersonal
" 'Young man, I don't suppose you
care for that at all, but if you had had
to eat what I hae for the past few
months it would taste like a dinner for (
the gods It tastes homey!'
"The ex-president had dined with
eerybody from the queen down, but
that cabbage and corned beef doubt

he was not so well known, but proba

STRENGTH IN SOME FORM
•"be Quality Aboe xjj Bla TOM
Woman Admires Ia Man
j Women abhor cowards and still more
Riioaks, though I regret to say they
often endure cads in a way that belies
then- Intelligence and good taste They
hae a quite pathetic desire to look up
to men, to feel men their superiors lo
strength of body and of mind, In calm
ness of Judgment and clearness of In
tellect And it Is Indeed a pity that
men so often seem to go out of their
way to destroy their most, cherished
Illusions
Aboe eerything a woman admires
strength in a man It may be strength
of body— she will worship a Hercules
with the brain of a guinea pig It may
be strength of Intellect— she will adore
a saant with 'the body of a gibbon
monkey It may be strength of char
acter—she will break her heart for a
politician or a financier who Is un
sweringly wrapped up In dreams of
personal adancement, and who pos
sesses no ' iuore heart than an 'oyster
But strength in some form she craes
unceasingly It is a hereditary • In
stinct that has been bequeathed to her
through Ee's first disappointment
when Adam was tried In the balance
and found wanting Woman, secretly
conscious of her own physical weak
ness and lack of Intellectual strength,
demands strength'- from man to make
up for her own deficiencies  Een the
strongest women,- strong In body, and
mind, well balanced as Athene herself,
though they may shield and protect
the weakness of the men they loe
and stoop to help them, win neer do
so without a secret feeling of contempt
which Is destruction of all ideals, Man,
in spite of that deplorable start made
by Adam, was Intended to be woman's
protector and refuge from all harm,
upon whom she could lean and rely In
eery eti-i cf life's pilgrimage, and
when the roles are reersed, as they
often so unfortunately are, It is a bad
thing both for man Personal and ' woman'
Strength, howeer, Is what women
loe In men— Lady Colin Campbell !
PRECOCIOUS AUTHORS
Successful Plays That "Were Written
by Boys In Their Teens
Was a successful play eer written'
by a boy of fourteen? asks a corre-;
spondent Yes This seeming miracle'
hits happened at least three times The
best known example of the precocious
playwright is the celebrated Lope tie
la Vega, the most prolific dramatist
known to history He produced his
first play, a comedy, entitled "La Pas 
toral de Jaclnto," before he had com-,
pleted his fourteenth year, and this
was considered such, a marelous per
formance that be is known to this tla
In Spanish literature as "the Prodigy
of Nature"  Another Spaniard and con-;
temporary of La Vega, Pedro Calde
ron, wrote his first play when he was
thirteen Metastasfo wrote his tragedy
"Giustino" and had it produced when'
he was fourteen on the stage at 80-'
logna 
j Of English playwrights ouglas Jer
rold, the famous author of "Black
Eyed Susan," also furnishes an answer
to the question In 1818, before he had
completed his fifteenth year, he wrote
a ery well known farce entitled
"More Frightened Than Hurt," It was
ery successful on the English stage,
and the French considered it good
enough to steal Curiously enough,
this French translation was retrans
lated into English and again produced
on the English boards under the title
of "Fighting by Proxy" Another ery
remarkable instance of a different sort
of precocity was that of William Hen
ry Ireland, who "when he was about
fifteen actually produced, some plays,
'which be attributed to Shakespeare
and which, although afterward proed
to be forgeries, were accepted by the
experts of the time as genuine—Pear

THE COLLECTOR WHO KNEW
An Illustration of the angrer of Bel
ins Too Self Confident
"The trouble with' you 'fellows is
you want things, but you know noth
ing about 'em You coini* oer here
and carry home a lot of ti'u-k that a
European  collector |wbu~a't gie
house room, and when you s;-e a really
pood thing you don't know* it or you
won't pay a price for It unless some
dealer makes you You see, you don't
know; that's what's the matter; how
can you? Nobody Jn America wanted
antiques before the Centennial If
you'd lied here twenty years, like me,
you'd learu something, you'd find out
thaf collecting Isn't a thing of money,
but knowing"
-We had been walking In Venice
down a narrow calle while the collect
or was speaking "Look at that old
brass scale," he resumed, pointing to a
fish stall in the little outdoor market
on which we had just  emerged
"There's a gem, not ery old, but of
the finest seenteenth century Venetian
work If you saw that in a New York
dealer's, all cleaned up, you'd gie up
a good deal for It; but you'd 'a' passed
it by a dozen times If I hadn't spoken
about It See that old Junk stand oer
there? I neer pass -a thing like that
You can neer tell what you may pick
upn-lf you only kno-c"
We had scarcely* reached the stand
when the collector thrust out his hand
with the swiftness of a hawk darting
on Its prey, and swooped upon a little
Jewel box
"Carnellanj Russian, 1 should  say,
from the Ural mountains  It's not of
great alue, but It's a ; pretty little
thing, if it was cleaned up - It's mine,'
anyway" To the keeper of the stallPersonal
"Quanto?" Personal \ • <
The Venetian slowly uncoiled him
self and came down from the church
Steps, where he-had been sleeping
"oes the slgnore want the pretty
trifle? The slgnore knows Its alue
better than I, and he'll be generous?" !
"I'll gie you a lira" for it It Isn't
worth it, but one mustn't be hard with'
the poor"
"I had hoped 1 should get fieP'
"Well, I'll make it two"
"It is the signore's" 
 "There, you see!" exultingly chuckled
the collector  "That's what It Is to
know An exquisite cornelian Russian
Jewel casket for 40 cents! You'd neer
hae thought of looking among a lot
of rusty old Iron for a thing like that
would you?" i 
While speaking he held the box with
a miser's clutch
"May I see It, please?"
He reluctantly handed it to me as
though fearing I might make a sud
den dash down the calle with his treas
ure
"Phew!" said I contemptuously,
handing the box back to him "It's not
carnellan at all It's glass, nothing but
glass"
"Glass!" drawing a magnifier fromPersonal
his waistcoat pocket and mutely ex-,
a mining the purchase  "I'm— l'm—
afraid— it is!" he said sheepishly
"Of course it is"
"I-<lon't know," sadly "Yes, it Is'
glass! You see, It's so dirty Oh, well,
we all make mistakes at times o
you want it?" disgust taking the place
of sadness "You can hae it for a
quarter" 
 "Well, I guess it's worth a quarter"
I think my eyes must hae snapped
"Yes"
And that Is how an almost unique
example of the cinque cento came into
my collection of Venetian glass— New
