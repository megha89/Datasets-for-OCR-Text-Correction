I wns uoring a youh of nineeen,
I had a fancy o go abroad In ihc

I made n companion of lec, and he
seemed o enjoy my sociey In prefer
ence o (Jin of young fellows of his
own age Ho gne me his confidence
In eeryhing bu one  womnn
laid siege for him, and he did no ell
mo Ills faher had lecured him be
fore going away on his suscepibiliy
and old him ha I was empowered o
forbid his aenions o any woman
lee no only failed o rus he ma
er o me, bu old he womnn who was
rying o snare him of my charge She
was smar enough o keep aloof from

keeper no o diulge he fac ha I
knew of wha was goiug on If I
could sae he boy I would pu his
faher under obligaions Mr Kirk
had grea poliical influence
lec wished he lady o win my good
opinion She, supposing ha I knew
nohing of heir affair, consened,
hough relucanly I was inroduced
o Miss Marha Colllngwood, aged
wenyeigh, impecunious, passably
good looking and of  common family
I called on her wih lec and during
he call manifesed a friendliness ha
disarmed boh Bu while exending

Gladys Hoyle, a young lady who had
he faculy of making he mos rasp
Ing remarks wih he mos kindly pre

is nohing which will urn a man from
a woman quicker han a feminine figh,
I hoped o use Miss Hoyle for he pur
pose of drawing ou whaeer of em
per Miss Colllngwood migh possess
and inended ha lec should winess
he scrimmage
Ye secured Miss Hoyle, and I chose
her for my parner Miss Collingwood
opened he gnrue, sering o me I
sen he ball back, and she reurned
i I dropped jus wihin he line, bu
I pronounced i foul '•' ;< i
"Tha wasn' foul," said Miss Col

I looked a my parner for suppor
"Cerainly i was," she said
"My eyes mus hae deceied me,"
said Miss Colllngwood
"Some people can' play ennis a
all," reurned Miss Hoyle, "on accoun
of heir eyes I hough I saw some
hing amiss wih yours I's quie
noiceable"
There was an ominous flash from
Miss Colllngwood She made no re
ply, and he, game wen on My own
game had opened auspiciously, and
forune coninued o faor me Miss
Hoyle in olleying close o he ne

racke and caugh a rickling sream
of blood In her handkerchief
"You did ha on purpose" she cried,
casing a (lashing glance a Miss
Hoyle
"You flaer me If I could hi a
mark like ha I'd ener for a cham
pionship," replied Miss Hoyle
Miss Collingwood was geing ready
for a rejoinder when I added o her
ruSling by asking if she would pro
ceed wih he game
"I don' hink she'd beer," Miss
Hoyle pu in, "wih ha nose I'll be

"Some people are offensie wih

Pleasure had gone ou of he game

Miss Colllngwood sared for he house

Insead of accompanying her, found
