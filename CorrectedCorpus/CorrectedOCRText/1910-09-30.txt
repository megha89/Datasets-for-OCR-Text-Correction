I is naural for a man o wan o hold

a monopoly of a good hing in he way

U S Gregory was eleced sheriff

is now saying ha he superisors are
up agains i sure his ime ; also he
sherilF for his insul o he press re

Mr Gregory is a seran of he
people, and in no way whaeer had
he he righ o make he remarks he
did while in he performance of his
duies I looks like a sure case ha
some one has shown and is showing
faorism Cerainly he board of
superisors may wake up some day in
he near fuure and find ha hey
hae been asleep ; ha is up o hem
now o redeem hemseles and he
promise hey gae when hey ran for
office ha would do all in heir power
o gie he "people a square deal"
I had a ery ineresing alk wih
he manager of Richards elecric
heare, and he said here mus be
somehing wrong somewhere, as afer
he decision of he board of superisors
clearing Mr Rao from paying licence,
and righ afer he meeing he
sheriff came o Suer Creek and col
leced he firß week $10 and he
second week anoher $10, This seems
an unjus piece of business In closing
he manager of Richards heare said
he has made a proes in paying $10
for a license, because of he fac ha
Rao is coming o Suer Creek o
sar a show in opposiion, and if he
can show free and Mr Richards no,
why hen Mr Richards will cerainly
hae o close up shop
Mr Kichards wans i known ha
he is no ax dodger, ha he is willing
o pay his share Tha since he
sared his new place in Suer Creek,
he has had only four nighs which wee
aderised wo weeks ha gae aude>

poran work o be done We hough
ha he direc primary elecion law

ha issue I am fighing for oday
 The, sole objec, of his campaign
was, and is now, o make clear o

hinges much success for our sae, and
he republican pary as well
There will be no hesisaion or as

My consrucie policies as oulined
seem quie obious and unnecessary for
lenghy discussion
The imporan sae feaures of ' my
policies are as follows  I beliee in
he elecion of Unied Saes senaors
by direc oe of he people  pre
sen his imporan par of he goern
men is ruled by he sae legislaure
1 confess i will be nigh impossible for
us o change our consiuional laws,
bu, wih he direc primary law, we
are going o change he law so aa o
be able o elec our Unied Saes
senaors by direc oe
I beliee in he usralian ballo
sysem, I firmly adocae siaic ex
clusion, and I shall figh hard for he
direc legislaie law Tha his sae
can be goerned properly here is no
quesion in my mind, and I beliee
he people should hae some righ o
discharge 'all incompeen and corrup
officials, and fire hem ou of office
This is he recall ac ha receies
so much prominence in our plaform
I shall srie hard o see nn ad
equae employers' liabiliy law Ger
many and France ake care of heir
, injured employes, and seeral of our
saes hae already adoped such laws
ha will make liable he company for
any risk ha he employee migh be
subjec o, and make he employer
responsible for negligence ha migh
 cause injury o any employee
p Now hs o our conseraionism,
Pincho and Garfield blazed he pah

ll good ciizens, regardless or pary

nhe foreground
of the fighting progressive states of
the union, with our demands, which
are : government by the pedple, and
not government to satisfy the interests.
La Folette pioneered the policies in
the Middle West, and today we are
marching side by side with New
York's peerless leader, a man who has
principles and who expressed his poli
cies fearlessly in what is termed in
surgency; a man who made it possible
to make the insurgency fight in this
state a crowning success, a man who
is loved and honored by all, Theodore
Roosevelt. Now whether you call it
insurgency, or whatever other name
you care to invent for it, we are sim
ply demanding the rights for the
people, and I. assure you we will be
successful in our fight. Insurgency
really stands for true and honest pur
poses, and I claim it is our duty to
fight the monopolies as long as they J
attempt to run our government.
The interest of our government must
be considered before any special in
terests, the struggle of the freeman
: must be heard before the clamor of
corporations for power.
I am in this fight to help these little
ones assembled here, by helping to
give them an equal footing, an equal
opportunity with that of the rich man,
in preparing for them a future such as
they will be compelled to face. This
is our aim and for tnis purpose I am
struggling now.
■ We appeal to you in this fight, . that
all who desire to see a reform move
ment carried through successfully, fall
in and help us defeat the tyrants and
grafters the machine men and ■ the
Southern Pacific
I ask you men and you women to do
all in your power to help us give back
to the people of this glorious state
that which is. their own, Goodby.
At the conclusion of the address,
Judge Wood invited the large as
semblage to'come forward and shake
hands with the next governor. ' But
he added, before you do it, I ask you
all to give three cheers for Hiram
W. Johnson. Three cheers were
given, and the crowd then began
surging on to the hotel porch .where a
hearty handshake was given every
extended hand, and a formal intro
ducction made by Dr. A. M. Gall,
who was standing to the side of. the
speaker. '
The band played the Star Spangled
Banner, which concluded the meeting.
At 2:30 p. m., the party again
seated themselves jh the autos, and
the run for Mokelumne Hill vvaq be
gun. The party spent the nigrht at
Angels Camp.
The crowd assembled; to hear the
speaker was estimated to be between
five and six hundred all told. The
schools of the city were dismissed
for the occassion, and the 'pupils
marched from the building to the
seats arranged in the street in front
of the National hotel.
This was without a doubt an excel
lent move on the part of the- school
principal, as it gave his pupils a
chance of hearing one of the most bril
liant speakers of which the state can
boast,'

A grass fire that threatened damage

An alarm was sent in, and many
people hastened to the scene, and the
fire was extinguished before any dam

A meeting of democratic candidates
was held in the sheriff's office on Mon

speaking definitely arranged. The
matter, which seemed to be a com

dates which the democrats desired
falling on nights in which the republi

towns, was straightened out, and the
delegates all urged to be on hand on

Base Ball Enjoyed
Sutter Creek and Placerville base
ball teams crossed bata on the Sutter
diamond last Sunday, and Placerville
was defeated to the tune of 9 to 3.
Sutter Creek received a victory
which Jackson can feel proud of, as
five of the nine players were from the
county seat, and wore Jackson uni
forms.
Ilcding Boro ttitched for the Sutter
team, and it can be safely said his
balls are growing more puzzlcsome
each game he plays. Mis ball is easily
hit, but its peculiar twirl when in con
tact with the bat, becomes dead, and
seldom is struck into the outfield. A
largo buss carrying 14 Jackson fans
went over to the game, and every
available carriage also journeyed to
the busy town for a good game of ball.
Among Jackson players in the game
were Love, t s short stop, who received
a bad jolt on the neck while sliding to
a base Skelly, who played third base,
also received a bad injury to a to*
on the right foot; Will Boro, first
base. Walter Steel, right field. What
a pity that Jackson is not making a
better showing on her' own diamond,
which is one of the best grounds in the
foothills.
The new manager is everything that
can be desired, but the team has been
so badly managed by its old regime
that it will take a great deal of hard
work to again place Jackson on the
good ball line.
That the players are here, there is
no question. Cromer is, always re
liable, and as good a player as will
ever visit this section for first base.
Love 12 excellent material for second
base or short stop. Brown as catcher,
Steele, Brown, Coster as pitcher ;
Skelly, Jackson's popular third base
jnan on the third sack, Arditto, Fort
ner, the Vela boys can be placed in al
most any position on the team.
Jackson certainly should hold in
with the new manager, who has the
backbone to make a strong team pay
well, and furnish good games.
