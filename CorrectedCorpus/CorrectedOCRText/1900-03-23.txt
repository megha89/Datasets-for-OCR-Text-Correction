On Monday as the Mokelumne Hill
stage was on its way to the Hill and
when near, the resilience of Archie
Campbell . a man disguised - with a
handkerchief over his face stepped
from the brush and leveled a pistol at
young Colton, the driver.. The move
. ment was so sudden that the' horses —
. one of which was a young colt— were
badly frightened, and, jumping sharp
ly to one side, came near  upsetting tbe
'stage. ' Fortunately Colton was per
fectly cool and recognizing the man,
desi'itv his disguise, told him in lan
guage more forciolo than polite to take
the haudkerchicf from his face. This
the fellow did, and explained that it
was all a joke! Such jokes are rather

Work on the plant of the Standard
Electric Company, above Mokelumne
Hill, is being pushed with' all possible
' energy. Last week .'several big mule
teams were put to work hauling mate
rial to the ground, and word has been
extensively circulated that every man
who applied would be set to work. In
consequence of the latter report, the
roads leading to the plant have been
crowded the past week with men with
blankets on their backs , all hastening
to this Mecca of their hopes. San
Andreas has had its. share and its
-streets have had the appearance of tbe
track of a retreating army.

Growing Exclusiveness in American Works.

for visitors to obtain permits to inspect

SELF-DENIAL Yv'EEK.
Another Factor in the Great Work of
the Salvation Army.
Tho Salvation Array .stands foremost
as a powerful spiritual and social factor
amoug tbe Christian nations of the
earth. With their characteristic
energy and thoroughness they are ex
tending year by year their work into
territories as yet untouched, especially
in heathen lands. They settle embar
rassing financial questions by_ volun
tarily depriving themselves not only
of comforts, but even of necessaries,
in what is known as the Week of Self-
Denial. The money thus secured in
this great annual effort is spent direct
ly in the extension of their field of
labor both at home and in the foreign
missionary field.
Besides their regular missionary and
relief work, the Salvation Army has
this year another and most urgent
work of relief-on hand. A desperate
cry for help comes from India, where a
fearful famine is raging at the present
time. Not less than 30,000,000 of
Hindoos are on the Verge of starva
tion.
Salvationists are linked together in
all lands in a strong bond of true
brotherhood, and there will be during
Self-Denial Week of this year a great
rallying of force* to the relief of those
famine-stricken people in India.
A glance at tho annual report for
ISilil reveals a development in tho social
operations in the United States of
which the Salvation Army may well be
proila.
Their Shelters, . Rescue Homes,
Children's Homes and kindred social
institutions are highly commended for
cleanliness and practical management.
Their, permanent Rulief Depots, viz:
One Cent Meal Depots. Labor Bureau
and Salvage Brigades are doing an im
mense amount of practical and efficient
work in tho way of relieving tho ap
palling distress among hundreds of
thousands of the poor of this country.
The Salvation Army is the recog
nized friend and comforter of the
poorest and lowliest, and their efforts
iv behalf of 'the millions of "sub
merged" are. deserving of tlTe highest
praise 1 and the liberal support on the
part of those- who are in the happy
position to be froo from the wretched
worry for their daily bread. May
every ono who belongs to this fortu
nate class help to swell the Salvation
Army Relief Fund during their an
nual Week of Prayer and Self-Denial,
which for this year is set for the days
from March 25th to April 2d.
Care of Children.
One important factor often neglected
in the care of children is fresh air.
They should have a good • airing out
of doors at least once a day,
when the weather- is favorable.
Thus they get plenty of oxygen, 'so
vital to growth and development,
become hardened and accustomed to
the vicissitudes of a changeable climate.
They should have plenty of sleep,
small amounts of the proper kind of
food at regular intervels, -daily baths,
followed by mild friction with a soft
towel, preferably before their morning
airing.
A great doctor once remarked that
bad ventilation deforms more children
and destroys more health than acci
dents or plague. Baby should never
be put to sleep in bed or or perambu
lator with the head under . the bed
clothing to inhale the air already
breathed. By doing this you are
smothering the life out of your child's
lungs. How would you like to drink
the water you wash in? Well, when
you cover your baby's head up you
force him to inhale into his lungs air
that is just as bad, and just as impure.
. Remember that the night nursery
needs ventilation as much as the day
one, and sec that ono of tho windows is
left open at night. A screen to pro
tect the bod from draught will remove
any danger of taking cold. — Cincinnati

Genteel Tramps in Onr Church.
Tho famous' authpr qf "The Bonnio
Brier-Bush" has discovered that tho
modern church is infested with "gen
teel tramps, " and he is going -to make
them the subject of an article in the
April Ladies' Home Journal. It may
be said in advance that "lan Ma
claren's" tramp are not what we know
in everyda-y parlanceas -'hobos, "but
seemingly most estimable persons who
are attentive to their churchly duties,
as they see them, but who are, never
theless, a drawback to the advance
ment of tho church. "The Genteel
Tramps in Our Churches" gives the
Scotch clergyman some exceptional
opportunities for forciblo and direct
words tp the chureh'-gpors — words that
would probably create much cpnsterna
tion in a congregation if uttered from
tho pulpit.

"UNITED STATES" DEFINED
The Term As Applied to Our
New Possessions.
DOES IT DESIGNATE THE WHOLE OR JUST A PART?
Majority and Minority Reports to the
. Ways and Means Committee
Have Been Made.

■ Reports were received from the sub
committee which has considered the
meaning of. the term United States!
as applicable to. Puerto Rico, the
Philippines and other new possessions.
These reports were received with great
interest, and were regarded as deter
mining a most important line of policy
by. those in authority. The majority
report, by Mr. Dalzell, of Pennsyl
vania; Mr. Hopkins, of Illinois, and
Mr. Grosvenor, of Ohio, was as fol
lows:
Your committee is of the opinion:
First— Thatjhe term "United States"
in that provision of the Constitution
which declares that "all duties, im
posts and excises shall be uniform
throughout the United States" means,
and is confined to the States that con
stitute tho Federal Union, and does
not cover also the territory belonging
to the United States.
Second— That tho authorities treat
ing of this question and decisive of it
are those that treat of and involve in
their decision the question as to
whether the Constitution, ex proprio
vigore and independent of treaty stip
ulations or Congressional legislation,
extends to territory ceded to any ac
quired by the United States.
Third— That tho weight of these
authorities sustains the following prop
positions, viz:
(a) That the United States may ac
quire territory either under the treaty
making and" war power of the Con
stitution, or by virtue of its general
powers of sovereignty as a nation, in
which are. included all the inherent
powers of .sovereignty both of the
United States as an independent nation
and all the powers of the several
States as sovereigns.
(b) The power to govern .acquired
territory results from the right to-ac
quire, and also from the provision of
Section 3, Article IV. of- the Consti
tution, to-wit: "Power to. dispose of
and make all needful rules and regu
lations respecting the territory and
other property belonging to the United
States."
. (c) That Congress has power to gov
ern acquired territory independent of
the limitations of the Constitution, but
in cases where the territory has been
acquired "for the purposes of State
hood, Congress would bo subject to
those fundamental limitations in favor
of personal rights- which are formu
lated in the Constitution and its amend
ments; but these limitations exist
rather by inference and the general
spirit of the Constitution, from which
Congress derives all its powers, than
by any 'express and direct application
of its provisions."
(d) That Congeess has power to gov
ern Puerto Rico and tho Philippines
independent of tbe limitations of the
Constitution. ' -
The minority report by Mr. Rich
ardson says:
The meaning of the term "United
States" has been defined by" the Su
preme Court of the United States.
The question was passed upon by Chief
Justice Marshall, of the Supreme
Court, and he undertook to define
what was meant by tho term as it was
used Section 8 of Article 1 of the Con
stitution.
Mr. Richardson quotes from Justice
Marshall's ' ppinipn in the case of
Lqtighborough against Blake, 5
Wheat., 000, In which it is stated as
to the above clause of, the Constitu
tion: "This grant is general, without
limitation as to place. It consequently
extends to all places over which the
government extends."
Continuing, Mr. Richardson says:
Does this term, dosignato tho whole
pr any particular portion of the Amerr
ican empire? Certainly this question
can admit of but ono answer. It ig
the name given to our great republic,
which is composed of States and Ter
ritories. . ' •
Mr. Richardson also refers to a sim
ilar ruling by Chief Justice Tanoy in
19 Howard, 397, and says no other con
struction has ever . boon given by tho
Supreme Court. Many other cases are
cited in general harmony w|th this
view, q,nd Mr. Richardson says:
It follows, therefore, that tho term
United States, as used in tho section
referred to, means all tho States and
Territories of the United States, The
construction of tho term, as given
above is In perfect harmony with tho
views of statesmen and jurists, and of
the practice of our government for
more than a hundred years, and any
other construction would work a revo
lution in our system of taxation. It
will be observed the ma'jprity members
of the subocommittee submit no opin
ion or docision of. the Supreme Court
of the United States to sustain the
contentiou they make.
Mr. Newlands also submitted a re
port.—N. Y. Tribune.

Actresses Faint Their Faces.
"It is a mistaken idea that actresses
are as a general rule handsomer on the
stage than off," writes Franklin Fylos,
of "The Theatre and Its People," in
the March Ladies' .Homo Journal.
"Tho reverse is as likely to bo true.
Nevertheless, all theatrical faces have
to be painted. It may be assumed
safely that none pf the complexion is
genuine. An exceptionally clear and
pink skin may require no falsity. A
dark one may chitnce to suit the char
acter to bo assumed. But these excep
tions to tho rule are rare. The glare
of artificial light would make most
faces ghastly white or unpleasantly
sallow if bright hues were not laid on.
Tho art of coloring a pretty visage just
enough, and not overdoing it, is one
which all actresses should learn. Many
do not, and so we see beauty disfigured
instead of enh^ffppfl. Others are very
expert. There are two distinct pro
cesses. One makes use of colored pow
ders appliod dry. The other mixes the
same powders with grease, making a
substance called greftse paint."

ONE ON HENRY CLAY.
He Swapped the Site for the New Court
Building for a Jackass.
Attorney -General Griggs says the
new building for tbe Department of
Justice, erected according to the plans
already accepted, will cost half a mill
ion dollars more than was expected,
tbe total expenditure required being
$15,000,000. Fortunately the Govern
ment owned the site — a plot of ground
just opposite the Treasury, respecting
which, with its immediate surround
ings, some interesting stories are told.
Commodore . Rodgers years ago
brought to Washington from Spain
four Andalusian jackasses — jackasses
of high degree and purest lineage.
The long-eared quartet excited a vast
deal of admiration. Henry Clay saw
them, and, being himself interested in
the rearing of fine stock, was mosjb
anxious to possess ono— so much so, in
deed, that he offered to "swap" a large
lot of land near the corner of Penn
sylvania avenue and Madison ' place,
valued today at about $60,000. The
Commodore accepted, and Mr. Clay,
having thus acquired title to one of
the jackasses, immediately proceeded
to lose it over a gambling table. This
did not end the matter, however, for
Mr.^Clay afterward redeemed the jack
ass and sent It to Kentucky, where it
became the progenitor of what is now
the most remarkable strain of mules in
the United States.
As for the lot Commodore Rodgers
built on it a large and imposing man
sion of brick, which in later years ob
tained the cheerful designation of the
"House of Doom" because of the series
of tragedies and misfortunes connected
with it. The Commodore died in it
soon after its completion, and then it
was turned into a fasionable boarding
house, which failed, 6wamping the
finances of the proprietress. Next it
became the home of - the Washington
Club. When the Civil War broke out
the club went to smash, and Secretary
Sewdad leased the mansion for his resi
dence. It was here . that he and his
son, with three other persons, were
nearly butchered to death by the
assassin, Payne. Undeterred by its
tragic history, James G. Glaine bought
the "House of Doom" in 1890, and
from that time on he had nothing but
misfortune. He lost a daughter, and
his son, Walker Elaine, died in the
house. Finally he, himself, died there,
and then the mansion was torn down

Wanted Two Babbits
Robbie had longed earnestly for a
baby brother and a pair of white rab
bits. The answer to both wishes came
on the same morning, but it was not
quite satisfactory, for there were two
baby brothers and only one rabbit.
Robbie was greatly disgusted at the
mistake. The next day his father
found the following notice tacked to
the gate post: ' : ;,'
"For Sail — One nice fat baby or I
will swap him for a white Rabbit."

King Solomon's Mines Located.
Rider Haggard wrote a romance about
the finding of "King Solomon's Mines,"
which Dr. Carl Peters now thinks he
has discovered. Dr. Peters does not
give their precise situation, but says
that they are near the eastern en
trance of the Lupata gorge, on the
banks of the Muira river, about fifteen
miles south of the Zambest and half
way between Sena and Tete. -.The
modern name of the locality is Fura,
which Dr. Peters says is a corruption
of "Afur," which in turn was the Sa
baen, or South Arabian name of the
Hebrew "Ophir." The natives call
themselves Makalange, which means
children of the sun, and, unlike other
Africans, are sun and fire worshipers to
the present day., He says that they
are quite unlike other native races and
have a distinctly Jewish cast of . fea
tures.. So he claims unhesitatingly to
have j discovered - the golden - Ophir of
King Solomon and King Hiram.

FRIDAY..: .......; 7.... MARCH 23, 1900
An object lesson on the credit of nations was furnished
by the action of the British Government in offering English
Consols, bearing two and three fourths per cent, interest," to
American investors — the first time such an offer was ever
made — at ninety-eight and three fourths per cent, of their face
.. value, and by the Fiuance Bill, devised by Republicans, which
will this week become a law. This bill provides for refund
ing the entire bonded indebtedness of the United States into
- two- per cent, bonds, lower than any nation has ever floated
bonds, and assurances have already been recieved that the new
bonds will be gladly. taken at par by the holders of the old
■ ones. That is the sort of statesmanship the Republicans give
this nation. They were not satisfied that our credit should
be as good as that of any other nation, but have made it better
than that of the best.
The Ledger was informed yesterday that in all prob
ability grading on the railroad from lone to Jacksou would
"begin sometime in April; that the iron had been ordered and
other material and supplies were on the way. An assurance
was given that the road would certainly be completed during
the present year and possibly in August. Geueral Manager
Woodard is now making, as we understand it, his final in
spection of the proposed line as surveyed by Chief Engineer
Feusier, and, so far as the Ledger is advised, he is well
pleased with the work that has been done. That the road
will be built in the near future seems to be the prevailing
impression in lone and by many here.
Representative Brosius, of Pennsylvania, a very
level-headed gentleman, voiced the opinions of many Repub
licans when he said: 1 "There is a difference between a philo
sopher and a statesman. A statesman must keep his feet on
the ground while a philosopher may be permitted to do more
or less theorizing. Therefore I regret this tendency to .yell
but against the Republican party at this time, particularly on
the part of some "very prominent Republicans. I firmly be
lievethat the Republican party is able to meet successfully
any problem that confronts it, and we ought to be willing to
• wait with patience for the solution of the great problems at
tending the possession of our new islands."
The action of the Senate Committee on foreign relations
in'amending the Nicaragua Canal treaty so as to reserve to
the United States authority to defend the canal in any way it
may- see fit in time of war seems to meet with general ap
proval. There is no reason to suppose that the amendment
will be objected to by England. In fact it cannot very well
be objected. to since the amendment is in almost the exact
language of a clause in the treaty under which the Snea Canal
.IT is said that butter Creek is to have another news
paper. . There may be room in Sutter for two newspapers,
but the Record certainly fills* the bill pretty thoroughly, and
it is an ably conducted journal and an honor to the commun
ity in which it is published, and the whole county, for that
matter. The LEDGER is doubtful about the success of a fifth
paper in the county, but is willing to concede the fact that in
all professions there is plenty of room at the top.
The passage by the German Reichstag, of the bill aimed
• at American meat products, has not produced a pleasant feel
ing in Washington, but neither in Congress nor in adminis
tration circles is there any disposition to publicly criticise
.the matter in its present stage. It is easy to infer, however,
from what is said by those who are in position to make good
their words, that if Germany deliberately invites a commercial
• conflict with us, she will be made to deeply regret having
That the officer commanding our army should have a
higher rank than any other officer, is the opinion of several
eminent men, Senator Lodge being among the number. He,
therefore, introduced' a joint resolution giving to the senior
Major General, while commanding the army, the rank, pay
and emoluments of Lieutenant General. Representative
Moody of Mass., offered the resolution in the House.
There seems to be a general belief among those familiar
with the politics of Kentucky, that; unless the Goebel law is
.repealed, the State will go Republican as sure as candidates
for the office of President are nominated. If this happens,
Kentucky will probably remain permanently in the ranks of
Republican States.
Senator Elk ins lias put a stop to the talk of his being
a candidate for Vice President, by sayfog that he does not
wish the office, and that he does wish to remain in the Sen
ate. He also expressed the opinion that President McKinley
should be allowed to choose the cafldjdaje for Vice President.

GOLD SAVING BY DREDGING
Process Is Becoming General
In California.
MUCH CAPITAL IS INVESTED IN THE INDUSTRY
Many New Dredges Being Built, and
Many More In Contemplation,
On the Feather River.
Almost ever since gold was discover
ed in our State it has neen known to
exist in various quantities and various
conditions of fineness in the gravel and
sands of our rivers, but the fact that
these gravels and sands are generally
covered by a depth of water, which
renders the usual machinery and
methods of recovering that precious
metal inadequate, the matter of saving
it has been neither systematically at
tempted nor successfully accomplished
until recently.
Methods of washing gold from the,
gravels abow' : water level and in such
position that there is an abundance of
room for tailrares and ■ . tailings
have been successfully operated here
for years; but successful methods of
■recovering gold from the sands and
gravels of the river beds and banks are
among the latest achievements in gold
saving.
Tho most successful plan so far
known and operated is dredging, but
it is within the bounds of human pos
sibility that some other and more pre
ferable method may be discovered and
ultimately become more successful.
Today that method Is growing rapidly
in favor and many Individuals and
companies areconalantly putting much
money in the enterprises connected
therewith. But a little more than two
years ago tho first dredge was put in
operation on the Yuba river, and just
two years ago the first one was com
pleted and entered upon its gold-saving
career on tho Feather river near the
town of Oroville, Butte county. To
day there are five- at work within
a distance of five or six miles of that
placo and three ' Others are in various
stages of completion, while plans are
being laid for the construction of three
more which : it Is designed ■ shall bo at
work within the year. . Since each
dredgo thoroughly equipped costs from
$30,000 to $80,000, and the land upon
which, they operate costs from $75 to
$150 per acre, tho fact that the growth
of the dredging industry in that local
ity has been so great in the short
space of two yaars proves beyond the
possibility of a doubt that the business
is a success from the standpoint of the
investors, and is destined to be a' very
important factor in tbo gold-producing
record of tills otttlo during the coming
years.
In a general way there, are two iltf
ferent styles of divdgro; one, the ordi
nary shovel dredgo qulto similar 4n ap
pearance to those in use for tho
ordinary work of dredging along our
rivers and in our bays; and the other,
thfl continuous bucket-typo of dredge,
for which California is Indebted to
New Zealand, where it was brought to
perfection for gold saving in tho rivers
of that country years ago.
The conditions in New Zealand are
somewhat different from those en
countered in this. State. The rivers
there jti'u b#&h .swift and deep and the
matter of dradgetnjtqjng jn the main,
consists of lifting .the . gold-boarjng
gravel and sand's from the beds of the
rivers, separating the gold, and then
shpotiug the tailings overboard' and
into the rjy^r again without thought
or care .as tp their tin<*l dUpp.sjtion. In
the rivers of : California and the adja
cent gold-bearing lands the conditions
differ In that the tailings havo to bo
cared for, and that, . too, in it manner,
that will convey them far enough from
the boat that thoy will not roll or wash
down under it and prevent it floating
freely. This has been in part over
come by adding iQ fhe mechanism of
the dredges a stadw, wWph; by
means of a series of trays on an endless
belt, carries the rock and coarse gravel
back of the boat from forty to fifty
feet and at an elevation of twenty -live
feet, more or less, 4lßuhargg§ jt.
There are but two general tyf»ies pf
dredges in use at the present time, but
each dredge-master has introduced
methods of his own for some parts of
the work on his dredge, which makes
the work vary jn' many respects, but
only as to tho minor details, of course.
The shovel dredge, as above stated,
is, in general, similar in construction
to the ordinary mud dredge, used in
our rivers, the shovel baying a capacity
of from one to one and one-hjilf yards
when full. The hull of tho boat for
this capacity of shovel and the accom
panying machinery is about fifty feet
wide and eighty feet long. At the
front pf tho boat and near the port
side is fixed fcljQ crane which carries
the shovel. The shovel wprks . from
twenty to ilfty feot below tha level pf
the surface of the water. The shovel
is submerged and forced forward, cut
ting into the bedrock, and then up
ward to the limit of the bank. In its
movement forward the shovel is filled
and Ita movement continues forward
and upward to the hopper, orpptpd
about twenty feet above the boat on
the front starboard corner, where its
contents are dropped and from thence
undergoes the washing process. From
the hopper, tho rocks, gravel, Band; in
fact all the product from the shovel
drops to a swinging "grizzly" made of
shcpfjrpn with holes three-eights to
five-eights wf fi.n jnch in diameter.
This ''grizzly" swings rapidjy and \s aj
all times assaulted by » myriad Of
small streams of water under heavy
pressure from a centrifugal . pump.
These streams wash the fine material
through the holes In tb.6 "grizzly, "and
wash the coarse material clean and
from the "grizzly" it starts on its
journey over the stocker to the tailings
pile. TUa fine material goes through
the' holes in tho '/gflzzly" dropping
to tho riffles consisting of augur holes
halfway through boards set •in ih
clinud sluice boxes, .Into which quick
mlver is fed. . Thp first series of riffles
is ' about the length 'of the shaking
'•grizzly'"— from twelve to fifteen feet—
and on this seventy-five per cent of the
product is caught. Afterward ' the
pulp is carried the entire length of the
boat over other riffles and is finally re
turned to the water about ten feet back
of the boat and at ita level. The
shovel is alternately filled and emptied
from seventy -five to eighty times an
hour when all is moving well. 'To
operate the machinery of a dredge
of this pattern .requires 'from
eighty to one hundred horse-power,
which is generated by . use of wood and
coal. The furnaces, boiler and ma
chinery, stand on the boat's deck and
are covered by proper houses.,.. This
pattern. of dredge is kept in place while
at work by a. "set" or "speed" — an
iron-shod timber, which is driven'into
the river bed at the boat's corners.
The continuous bucket type of dredge
differs, very materially from the shovel
dredge.' The boat,," which is thirty
feet wide and seventy feet long, is con
structed with a well holefiyefeet across
extending from the front, back about
three-fourths of the boat's' length.
The buckets are : ! -generally thirty
eight .in. number .of, three and one
quarter cubic feet capacity, fastened on
an endless chain and working on. blad
der in the wellhole in such a manner
that they can dig vertically under the
boat, thirty feet below the surface of
the water or at any., angle in front of
that. The top end of the ladder is hung
on a bar, and the lower end is sus
pended by blocks and tackle and by
means of a winch can be lowered as re
quired. The continuous bucket chain
moves up the top sido of the ladder
and' down on the under side.
It is given its motion by rope
transmission at the top end. When in
operation the ladder is held firmly so
that every bucket digs into the sand,
gravol or bedrock with great force and
is filled, after which it passes up the
ladder and empties into a delivery
plate. It is closely followed by its fel
lows, and the motion of the continuous
chain of buckets gives . practically 3 a
continuous discharge of material into
the delivery plate. Prom the delivery
plate it moves by gravity into a revolv
ing screen or "grizzly," in. which water
for washing is conveyed through a per
forated pipe in many small jets under
great pressure. .The water washes the
fine material thrpugh tbe holes in the
"grizzly." The water, tho finer wash
dirt, and the .gold drops into a distri
buting box, which distributes the ma
terial to cither side, and on to gold -sav
ing tables. . These tables are divided
into sections and are covered with
cocoa matting and expanded iron
which catch tho gold. From them the
pulp is conveyed through sluice boxes
with riffles to the stem of the boat and
returned to the stream. The heavier
material is djseharged by the "griz
zly," at its lower end, dpwn a stone
chute uhd from 'thence onto a stacker
which carries it put beyond the boat
forty or fifty feat and at an elevation of
from twenty-five to . thirty feet above
the water level. '••'" ': ' '■'
' By tho method of goldsaving In use
on the continuous bucket dredges more
than sovonty-five per. cent of the gold
is recovered within three feet from the
point at which it leaves lihe distribu
tor. The expanded ■ iron over tho
cocoa mattfng gives tp the water com
ing onto it with muoh force, a piptjon
which seems to precipitate tho parti
cles of gold into the Interstices of the
cocoa matting whore they rest until the
matting is taken up and washed in the
cleanup tub. •In this process -of gold
saving no quicksilver is used and
cleanups caa fcpinade every day with a
loss of but a few momenta time flf the
This style of dredgo has on
it six winches which operate one line at
each c.qrner pf tho: bp,at, one head line
and one tp raise .ami jpwsr the ladder.
Tho corner fjnes and : the head line are
used tp keep the dredge in place while
working »P<] tp. altar its ppsitipn at

One of these dredges requires from
thirty to forty horse-power to operate
it to its full capacity.
Electricity is being introduced on
them as a power and seems to be in
great favor iuwmg ?'!?° m " n wno oper
ate the dredges, and, will doubtless
soon become the power in goneral uso
in this class of gold-saving. Its ad
vantages are many, for in the use
of steiim so. uu.vb rpom is required on
the boat that everything f^ crowded
and quits n fpree pf men \s required on
shore -to keep the •filFtiftoes going;
with electricity tho current is curried
aboard the boat by wire and when
properly installed ' requires but little
attention. ■..;•.-■ .'■'•
To operate a dredge requires a crew
consisting of a dredge superintendent,
(who, when quicksilver is used is .occas
ionally $lsp tl)o amalgamator) a roust
about, and three wows p.f tyyp or three
men each, each crew working eight
hours. The dredges operate but six
days in the week, taking Sundays for
repairing and other necessary work.
Tho first thought presenting itself to
the vjsitpr tp a dredge is how many
acres of grpund It tan hsnd}a in a- given
time. A. second thought djsclpses the
impossibility of even estimating (the
work by acres, for that depends en the
depth from the surface of the ground
to bedrock which varies in this sec
tion from sixteen to thirty-six feet. A
general jde# gfp,apscfty pf a dredge,
however, tmn bo se!}ure4 frptn th.c tp\
lowing facts: A company owning 156
acres of land has had one dredge oper
ating for more than a year, and this
year proposes to construct three more
dredges of greater capacity than the
one they are now operating to be put
on their 156 acres.

elver SCGtipn the largest piece of gold
he had . ever «een was. pf about five
cents' valuation, and the one piece was
the only ono ho had over seen which
approachod that value.
Tho surface of the ground which is
being worked by tho dredges it sandy
and rolling, covered in many, places by
willows and other'trees which ahe used
for fuel. The elevation of some of it is
so slight that it is entirely Biibmerged
once or twice a year during high water,
while other portions are entirely above
high water. That which is above has
been used to a limited extent for fruit
orchards and grain fields, while much
of that which is lietow could, by levees,
be reclaimed and made productive of
crops; all must give way, however, in
the" presence of the gold-seeker.
When it has passed through the
dredge all that is left in sight is high
piles of cobbles washed clean. The
soil and fine material having been re
turned to the stream at the stern of the
boat lies in its bed,' or is washed away
toward tidewater. • .

material separately may soon » be
changed, for a dredge, now in course
of construction, is designed to handle
all of the waste by means of a.centrifu
gal pump carrying it by pipe together
to whatever point is designed. . If suc
cessful, this plan .will add much to
dredge mining for the fine material
which is'how returned to the water,
but a few' feet behind the dredge, often
runs down under . it and keeps it from
floating freely and thus interfering with
its proper operation, and besides this,
the piles of washed .1 rocks which ''now
can be of no value, if -' covered up the
some soil'which formerly covered them
may become grass producing.
Dredging for gold, with machines
similar in construction to those herein
described, on the Mokelnmne river be
low Lancha Plana, is being considered
by capitalists who have bought a large
tract of land adjoining that river, dur
ing the past few months; and althongh
it is not probable that dredge mining
will ever be introduced' in Jackson or
its vicinity , it is possible that it may be
come a profitable industry in and
around Lancha Plana.

GROSS HOISTTO BE THIRD HIGHEST IN AMERICA
Bich Quartz At the Sheep Ranch.—
High Grade Ore At the Giuffra. J ;
—The Grizzly Mine.
AMADOR COUNTY.
The mines, producers and prospects,
in the vicinity of Jackson are going for
ward as usual. No new developments
this week.
Hoffman— Jackson.
It is rumored that a shaft will soon be
sunk on the Hoffman property near
Jackson.
Central Eureka— Sutter Creek.
Rock from the Central Eureka mine
is being handled at the Zeila mill.
South Eureka— Sutter Creek.
The pay-roll, of the South Eureka
mine is being increased. A large order
has been placed with Knight & Co. of
Sutter Creek, for a complete set of
hoisting machinery. In consequence
thereof a larger force will be required
at the foundry. The machinery is ex
pected to be completed in about four
months.
Defender— West Point.
At the Defender mine the shaft is
down about 240 feet and drifting north
and south is in progress. F. B. Joyce
is the superintendent and half owner of
the mine. '
Belmont— West Point.
Mr. McKelvey, owner of the Belmont,
the next claim south of tLe Catherine
and Adeline, has just finished the hoist
which is to be run by steam power.
The shaft, has been retimbered and
sinking is in progress. .
Catherine and Adeline— West Point.
The Catherine and Adeline, two
claims located east of the Defender
mine, will be unwatered as soon as pos
sible and sinking will begin. The hoist
will be finished this week. Messrs.
Stewart and Zavalla are the owners of
these claims and feel very much encour
aged as to future prospects.
JTeys|one— Amador.
At the Keystone mine Superintendent
W. A. Pritchard has. been making .a
number of changes for the purpose of
working the plant more economically
and systematically. The Keystone like
tho other Mother Lode mines is prepar
ing for the profitable working of the
immense bodies of low grade ore, long
known to exist. The superintendent
has added men, expert in this special
work to the office and mill and a num
ber of new men to the mine, the latter
tg shorten and cheapen the methods of
getting the ore frpm the mine and to
supply the increasing capacity of tho
mill. The mine at present is without a
foreman. The most experienced timber
men are at the head of the largest
stopes and the underground work Is
directly in charge of the superintend
ent. An air compressor is being built
to supply waste for filling the large
stopes and for stoping. The rumor
(hgt-ngne. but married men will be em
plpyed is without fpundatipn.
CALAVERAS COUNTY.
Prospect: W. W. Cook of Campo
Seco is about to erect a 10-stamp mill
on his mine near that town.: Contract
ors Getchel and Austin will commence
work on it next week.
Record: Workmen are preparing the
ground fpr the fpundation of the new
jrpn hpist which is tp be erected at the
Cross shaft. A giant was put up Wed
nesday and. the ground is being cut
down for masonry, The hoist, which
will be made of iron, is to be sixty feet
h(gb, and have a 30-foot base. It will
be the third highest in America, the
other two being the Calumet & Hecla
and the Anaconda
The Union mine was cleared of water
Tuesday and the work of putting in the
new machinery will now be commenced.
About 150 men will be employed and all
the old machinery will be taken out at
once.
t^untsin Pchor The Albany Flat
mines are coming to the front. There
is a prospect pf the Big Spring mine at
Marble Springs being sold to an eastern
syndicate before long. The St. Law
renoe mine Is being handled In a manner
that promises to make it a mine of great
value. The Romaggi mine has been
bonded for 835,000 and operations will
shortly begin on it. The Santa Anna
mine is being opened up and will receive
a thorough test. The Tulloch mine,
being^ prjispeptgd no. w, will
eventually come to the front and be one
of our leading gold producers. This is
a good mine and the time is coming
when the fact will be proven to the full
satisfaction of everybody in this local-
Citizen: The meeting of the stock-
Jjoldera pt the EftnT mint! tias'been post
poned until Monday next. It is hoped
that there may be a large attendance of
local stockholders. Nearly all the as
sessments have been paid up and the
mine is said to be in splendid condition.
Drifting is continued and the manage
ment is thoroughly satisfied. A full
report will be 'made' to t*he stock hold ers
gri Mgnday evening.

in his section to be looking 1 up and ex

- L. H. Carver, »tf the Table Mountain
mine, baiter kuuwn u=. the Martin,
went below last Friday and returned
on Monday, accompanied by' Mrs. Mar
tin. He expressed great confidence in
the property of which', he has posses
sion and he believes that he Is in the
true blue gravel and the Indications
are that this old property will soon
again be a large producer. It is said
this property belongs to George W.
McNear, the great gheat man, who is
amply able to work it.' ; : .
Adjoining property owners having
declined to sell them needed lands,
save what they consider as extravagant
rates, A. B. Thompson, of the Jupiter
(the San Domingo) mine, and Mr. Pur
ington,. of the Jack, Rabbit and Gari
baldi, of Dogtown, have determined to
jointly run a tunnel to tap their proper
ties. They will thus obviate any fur
ther necessity of buying $5-an-acre land
at fancy figures. The development
made on these mines justify these heavy
expenditures. r . ~<. : ;.
The Demarest with . its rattle trap
five-stamp mill has just made a clean
up of a thirty days run, netting about
$3200 in natural gold, and ten tons of
sulphurets, valued at from $100 to $125
a ton. , Not bad. The Demarest needs
greater development and a 20-stamp
mill. '
Mr. Gutmann the other day brought
down from the Sheep- Ranch mine
some very fine quartz, " that is very
rich and typical of this rich and singu
lar mine. It is blue-black in color and
heavy in gold. A few tons of such rock
would make a comfortable fortune.
The new owners arc naturally elated
over this find on the 1100-foot level and
they expect equally good rock on the
1200-foot level.
Chronicle: The Gypsie Queen owned
by F. A. Hanke, has a three-foot vein
and the ore Is promising. Work is be
ing prosecuted vigorously and the tun
nel has reached a depth of fifty feet. .
At the Santa Ritta gold mine, owned
by San Francisco parties, the tunnel
has reached a depth of fifty feet and It
is the intention to sink 125 feet deeper,
to tap the vein which is seven feet in
width. Five men have been working
night and day. From the present
showing there Is no doubt but that this
property will soon be on a dividend
paying basis. John Knox is superin
tendent.
At the Giuffra mine west of town, the
sinking of a winze was commenced this
week. The ore Is of a high grade and
the results are very satisfactory. From
a recent run of twenty-four hours, six
ounces of gold were cleaned up from
the outside plates.
TUOLUNINE COUNTY.
Independent: The new mill at the
Mt. Jefferson is now making s.weet
music for the Grovelandites, moving
along without break or stop, with ore
enough in sight to keep ten more
stamps — ten working now — busy for
two years. Mr. Melgban contemplates
putting down a new three-compart
ment shaft, which will be sunk 1000
feet before stopping.
Work at the Four Oaks is progressing
finely. At the depth, of U0 fe«t cross
cutting has been done fifty-eight feet
all in slate, assaying from $8 to 829.86
per ton. The shaft is down 120 feet.
A drift has been run 100 feet on the
main ledgeand seventy-five feetof cross
cutting has been made, all In ore with
the above results. It is only a question
of a short time when this mine will
furnish ore for a ten pr twenty-stamp
mill. Eight men are at present em
ployed, which force will soon be in
creased.
The Amazon mining claim, north of
Doer Flat, owned by Paynter & Gray,
is showing up very good now and all
indications point to a valuable deposit.
. At the Longfellow they are drifting
on the, 400 level, both east and west,
the east drift being run to connect with
the Mack mine fpr tbo purpose of ven
tilation and also of safety.
Prof. E. A. H. Human, owner of the
famous Old Eagle mine, above Ameri
can Camp, resumed operations oil -that
property this week. igtln'-l
E. P. McLeqd of the ."Marguerite
mine, situated on the Big Hill near
Blue Pitch, visited friends here Sun
day. He reports work in the main
tunnel of said property as being discon
tinued for the present, but the sinking
of a shaft on the vein further to the
north, is steadily going on— the same
having attained a depth of thirty feet
with a very encouraging outlook.
- T. M. Lane qf Knights Ferry was
here Monday and clpseS a deal on the
Vine Spring mine, which he has bond
ed. He will return again in a few days
and make preparations for beginning
active operations on the same. From
development work done so far, the
mine has made an excellent showing
and the property stands high In the
opinion of mining men.
At the Dondero mine at Yankee Hill,
the giant with $0 jnctjes, "p.f w.ater is
steadily playing away on the gravel.
A derrick for hoisting rock and bot
toming sinks is also in use. Seven men
are employed.
New Era: In sinking the main shaft
from the 700-foot level at the Grizzly
last week the famous Old Grizzly vein,
which cpntajns $hjr,te,en leat'h* sblid
quartz, was discovered, and Indications
are very favorable for a brighter future
than was over expected. The seventh
station will be completed in a day or
two, after which a drift will be run
south. The 20-stamp mill is kept
crushing by day, while nearly 5000 gal

BTAGE TRAVEL.
The Baggio Stage Lines Are Condneted By
': Competent Driven.
The Raggio stage lines (rgm Jp,ne tp
Jacks.p.n'so4 Sutfer, 'are doing a good
business, judging from last Sunday's
travel. When the train reached lone,
Agent Gondon found that his way bill,
when all noses had been duly counted,
called for seats in the Jackson and Silt
tor stages far nineteen or twenty pass
engers, ana a pile of baggage about
the size of a Sutro Height's sand dune.
In 'the best' of' good nature, Chris
and J 3& a<s Witt Q-Pflimeii,'
the uoapeotivo drivers of the three
stages, fell to and stored the baggage,
aftor which the passengers were as
signed seats and made as comfortable
as possible. All this was done in a
very short space of time, bus without
any bustle or false inoilo'ns ana witho'uj
ad^'bath ''being ut'Wred.' Raggio's
drivers' are gentlemen. ' V:" ■'-''*: ' '

Mr. and Mrs. Willard Calkins of

and the writer hereof. ; The roads
were very good and we hustled right
along, the afternoon being just cool
enough for comfort. Our rig.- having
considerable baggage, was the bust one
to leave the station, but by the skillful
driving of Jack O'Connell we reached
Martell's station some minutes ahead
of the other stages. It was one of the
pleasantest trips we ever had; over the
road, notwithstanding tho crowded

IRRIGATION IN OLD SPAIN
Large Areas Are Artificially
Watered.
THE COUHTRY, HOWEVER, IS HOT VERY ARID
The Effect of Irrigation On the Pop
ulation.—Methods of Irrigation
In Sice Culture.
The most prosperous agricultural
provinces of Old Spain are the two in
which the soil is probably the poorest
in the kingdom. But the valleys of
both provinces are thickly seamed with
irrigation canals and the slopes are
carefully terraced for cultivation. This
explains the paradox. • - ! - r -V
A very; large proportion of Spain's
cultivated area is. under irrigation.
Almost all ; the .vegetables and garden
fruits, lemons, oranges . and rice are
grown by irrigation, while tho grains^
vines and olives are chiefly, dry farmed.
Supplemental irrigation . is practiced,
irrigated crops being grown alongside
of non-irrigated. Ancient and modern
methods of irrigation seem to go along
almost hand In hand." 'Simple water
wheels are in "common use to obtain
water from wells, the power employed
being a horse, and the method of con
veyance small buckets, after the an
cient Egyptian fashion. On the other
hand,, many -artesian wells have been
sunk for irrigation and modern wind
mills are coming into use.
ROMAN AND MOORISH WORKS.
The total irrigated area of Spain is
nearly 3,000,000 acres, and some of
this comprises systems of great age
and of expensive construction. In
Valencia and Gatalonia the water used
is derived from swift mountain streams,
whence it is conveyed by long canals or
acequias along the mountain sides or
by lofty aqueducts to . the fields on
which it is to be used. Some large
storage reservoirs called pantanos have
been constructed, feeding a dense net
work of canals distributed over broad
plains. Many of the old ; irrigation
works, such for example as those of
the plains of Taragona, date from the'
Romans and . many other from the
Moorish period, while new ones are
being laid out at the present day.
POPULOUS UNDER IRRIGATION.
| The effect of this irrigation is shown
by the significant fact that the irriga
ted portion of the province ■of Murcia
has a population of 1681 per square
mile 'as against only ' 101 per square
mile from the entire province, while
Orlhuela has a population of. 767 per
square mile as against 194 from the
whole province. This shows the ac
complishment of irrigation in a humid
region. Of course in our own terri
tory the difference in population be
tween many Irrigated and non-irrigated
sections is far greater and might be as
one to 100, if not one to 1000.
When the great progress being made
in Irrigation in other countries is con
sidered, and it is remembered that the
work has scarcely begun in tho United
States where tens of millions of acres
lie waiting for reclamation, it must be
acknowledged that half the productive
capacity of the world has not yet been
reached.
IRRIGATED RICE FIELDS.
The most productive rice lands are
always Irrigated. Over a hundred
thousand acres of rice are irrigated in
Louisiana, and the method employed
by the planters place them at the head
of the world in rice culture. Their
advantage lies in irrigating in such a
manner that they can cut their crops
by machines instead of by the ordinary
method of the hand sickle. Rice irri
gation contemplates - a complete flood
ing of the field and leaving tho roots
under water, rice being an aquatic
plant. This being the case the only
way left for harvesting is for the
negroes to wade into the . marsh and
cut the grain by hand. The Louisiana
planters, however, lay their fields off
in plats and throw up furrows around
them, forming little walls or levees.
Then at the proper time the water is
turned in and the rioe grows. When
the grain is just about matured these
miniature walls are Jbroken down, and
the water run off. After several days
the ground is dry and firm enough to
allow horses and machines to go upon
it and harvest it as. they would wheat
or other grains, Thia places the rice
crop of Louisiana abreast of these
other orops, whereas, under the old
method it is a hundred years to tho
rear. What would next year's wheat
crop be If Its harvest were dependent
upon sickles? And yet, with the excep
tion »xf these Louisiana fields, the rice
crop of the South Is to-day irrigated
and cut as it was a century before
Brlgham Young's followers laid out
their first ditch in the wilds of Utah.

An Intelligent Pet Chicken— A Think
Inar Game— The Indian Children's
. . Best Chrlatmas.
Noah is my pet chicken, and I call
him Noah because he didn't drown in a
dreufblng rain to which he was expos
ed, says a contributor to Our Animal
Friends. He was cold and stiff and
bad almost stopped breathing when I
picked him up after the rain. I wrap
ped him in a cloth and laid him by the
cook stove.
At length, when he had been warm
ing more than half an hour and the
few feathers he bad were dry, he open
ed bis eyes and looked around. But ha
lay perfectly still in my hand and
teemed to be trying to make up his
mind whether he was dead or alive.
So I put him back In bis cozy conch,
only leaving his head exposed.
For another half hour he lay there
watching me with his wondering eyes,,
as if he were making an effort to cipher
out what had happened. Then I un
covered him again and put him on his
feet, and, to my surprise, he ran out of
doors as well and lively as be had eyer
been in his short little life.
' From his infancy Noah seemed to be
In delicate health. After his accident
I always put him on his perch at night,
and he still waits for me to come and
hoist him up to his sleeping place, al
though by this time he has grown to be
quite a good sized fowl.
At first I was afraid he could not fly
out of the chicken bouse In the morn-
Ing, so I went and lifted him out. and
now he always waits for me to come
and give . him assistance, bo matter
how late It may be. You see. he has
grown to be quite dependent. : | -^
While he loves the chickens that are
smaller than himself, be is also a fa
vorite among his elders, who never
peck him and chase him about as they
do his more hardy brothers and sisters.
Do you suppose they know that he is a
delicate child of the family?
A Thinking Game.
Quiet games trying tk* thinking
powers are always enjoyable. What
at first seems difficult after a little
practice is an easy and Inviting task.'
In this Instance the player who
leaves the room becomes the guesser.
and those who remain determine upon
what character or person he or she
shall be assumed to be. .When he re
turns, he is addressed as If he were
the * individual In . question, . and from
the character of the remarks addressed
to him he is supposed to guess whom
It Is he personates. This home amuse
menf naturally has the whole range of
history or fiction to choose from, so
that a variety of questions can be ask
ed which are either foolish or wise, ii's
the case may be. The more mislead
ing the greater the fun. For example,
suppose Queen Elizabeth was the char
acter selected. "Why dfd you remain
a spinster? Was your cousin as band
some- as yourself? Did you find flirt
ing as pleasing as governing? Which
would you prefer to walk on, plain
ground or black velvet?" These are
a- few of the questions that can be ask
ed. When the correct guess Is made,
the person whose answer leads to the
result must In turn leave the room,
and the game Is so continued until all
the players have had their turn or the
game is ended. As a matter of course,
the questions should not bo too ob
ylous nor too misleading. They in
some way should Indicate the charac
ter while -at the same time put the
guesser at his best, using his wits to
the ereatest advantage.
Unappreciated.
' The teacher of a district school In
Maine tells a story that reminds one of
Mary and her little lamb, only it Is of
Joe and his little dog.
Joe was a boy about 8 years old and
was devoted to a small, lank puppy.
Out of school hours boy and dog were]
Inseparable, and Joe apparently could
not reconcile himself to the necessity
of leaving the dog at home. For sev
eral mornings the teacher allowed the
puppy to remain at Joe's feet under
the desk.
Then there came a day when the
small dog could not be kept quiet, but,
frisked about, to the delight of the
school and the dismay of the teacher.
"Joe," she said firmly, "you must
take that dog out"
Joe looked at her mournfully, but
picked up the pup and, with Its head
against his cheek, started for tho door.
The boy's feelings were evidently hurt,
but he 'said nothing until he reached
the door; then, giving bis teacher a
reproachful look, with a pitying glance
toward his dog, he said slowly. "And
he's named for you!"— Youth's Com
panion.
Their Beat Christmas.
The international doll collection of
Boston gave 206 Indian children "the
best Christmas they ever had." The
children covered two pine trees in their
school yard in California with the pres
ents sent. One hundred parents of
these children came miles. to see the
trees and enjoyed seeing them and the
presents as much as the children who
received them. In that climate the
presents could remain on the trees a
long time without Injury, which would
enable the children to enjoy the trees
and show each other the gifts which
belonged to them, making Christmas
day extend at least a week its length.
The superintendent of the school
writes: "The pleasure and Joy of these
helpless children would repay one for
all expense and trouble in sending so
'•far away as from the Atlantic to the
Pacific coast. Their gratitude also was
much greater than as a rule Indians
are credited with, and they are having
a very happy time, and the present*
sent have been an Immense help to
these children in the line of civiliza
tion."—Boston Herald.

Big Water Scheme
| Plan to HarnenM Spearnsh Creek
In tbe Dcaihvnoil Dlatrict.
The gigantic • undertaking of the!
Homestake Mining company In prepar- !
lug to divert the waters of Spearfish •
creek In sufficient quantities to furnish i
water for the operation of its plant, as
well as supplying the towns of. Dead
wood, Lead, Terry, Central City and
Terraville with water for domestic and
flre protection purposes, will revolu
tionize mining operations in that por
tion of the Black Hills, where a scarci
ty of water. has existed for a number
of years.
The work will be pushed as rapidly
as possible, says the Chicago Record.
All the machinery will be of the latest
and best pattern and already has been
ordered. Vitrified piping will be used.
The water will be developed close to
some springs at the head of Spearfish
creek, and It Is expected that more wa
ter will be developed from the under-
SPEARFISH FALLS.
flow— which at present does not come
to the surface— than the company will
take out" The water thus developed
will be carried through pipes by gravi
tation several miles down the creek to
a point where a pumping station will
be established. Here the water will be
pumped 400 feet to the top of a hill,
whence It will be taken by gravitation
to Lead and Dead wood. ffi?sS
The Homfstake company has pur
chased several thousand acres of irri
gated land in the Spearfish valley and
has located a large number of mining
claims near the original water right
for the purpose of holding sufficient
ground upon which to build the pump
ing station. The new ■ branch of the
Burlington and Missouri river railroad
running from Dumont to Spearfish
creek will connect the pumping station
with the main line of the Burlington
railroad and will furnish easy trans
portation for fuel and other necessary
supplies. One of the original water
rights Is located about half a mile
above Juniper gulch, another on the
east fork, about four or five miles
above the junction with the main
creek, while the other waters come
from Juniper gulch.
Consumption of Beer In Germany.
According to the statistics published
by the imperial bureau, the consump
tion of beer in Germany during the
year 1897-8 was 1,383,700,000 gallons,
while it was 1,237,000,000 gallons in
the United States, 1,192,000,000 gallons
in Great Britain, 403,500,000 gallons in
Austria-Hungary, 279,000,000 gallons
In Belgium. 180,000,000 gallons in
France and a little over 90,000,000 gal
lons in Russia. Of the 1.383.700,000
gallons brewed in Germany, more than
a quarter was produced in Bavaria,
while the Brandenburg Marches pro
duced about 135,000,000 j gallons, the
Rhine provinces about 103,000,000 gal
lons. Saxony 94.500,000 gallons. Wurt
temberg 85,000,000 gallons, Silesia G7,
500,000 gallons, Westphalia 62.000,000
gallons, the duchy of Baden 45,000,000
gallons and the duchy of Hesse-Nassau
nearly as much. It may be added that
of the beer produced In the Branden
burg province 63,000,000 gallons were
brewed In five Berlin breweries, a
fourth of this being brewed by one
firm. The consumption of beer per
head of the population is estimated at

.Malarial Research.
Nature gives an interesting summary
of the results achieved In malarial re
search by Manson, Ross, Grass!. Big
nanil and Bastianelli, and then goes on
to Indicate the lines along which fu
ture achievements may be expected.
The different species <>f anopheles
should be hunted for, in order to ec-o if
these are the intermediary hosts of the
different types of malaria throughout
the world and what species is most
concerned la human transmission. An
other problem will be wbetherthe ano
pheles can be extirpated from a locali
ty and by what means. It seems that
the anopheles Is confined to small
itrefts, so that "the suggestion of Ross
to draw off the water from stagnant
pools may not be so hopeless a task as
It would at first appear."
Three Halted Schooners.
It was on the great lakes that the
three masted schooner first made its
appearance. The unique character of
lake navigation created the necessity
for this type of sailing craft because of
the fact that with this class of vessel
sailors could handle the sheets from
the deck at times when it was impossi
ble to go aloft in one of those sudden
storms which make the life of the lake
skipper an uncertain and anxious one.

CHIEFS OF THE SULUS.
Each-llaa Hie Power of Life or Deatb
Over Hlx Subjects.
The social system among the Moros
is much more primitive than it Is
among the greater part of the other
Philippine races. A chief, or dato. con
trols a district. lie has his own par
ticular followers and his slaves. Be
sides these he may command all the
men of his own district In time of war.
He also has the right of life and death
over his subjects. For Instance, a few
weeks before we arrived in Jolo, Data
Jokaniue had occasion to execute one
of his followers. The man had been
Intrusted with money belonging to the
dato. The first time be came to his
chief and said:
"Oh. great aud henevolent dato. 1
have gambled away the money! For
give me!"
"Very well." said the dato. "See
that It does not happen again."
Once more the retainer came, saying:
"Oh, great ait 1 benevolent dato, again
have 1 gambled away thy money, and
again I beg tbee. In thy great mercy, to
forgive me!" . ; • ■
. "This is the second time I have for
given tbee." said Jokanlne. "but the
third time. I warn tbee, tbou sbalt die."
Vet again the unfortunate man re
turned without the money he had col
lected for the dato. . ' .
"Oh, dato.". he cried, throwing him
self at the feet of his chief, "I have
sinned again and taken thy money!
Mercy! Mercy!"
"Cut him down," said the dato to one
of his men-at-anus. The man offered
no resistance and was cut to pieces
with one of the great knives of the na
tives.-Harper's Weekly. VJV J :
