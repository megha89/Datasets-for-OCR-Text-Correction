republicans of he Souh o send uniusruced delegaes This
is he adice of farseeing poliical leaders of boh Norh and
Souh This is no promped by any desire o eiher help or
injure any aspiran for he nominaion, bu raher o safe
guard he ineress of he pary as a whole The republican
pary in he Souh is composed mainly of colored ciizens
and he federal officeholding class I is realized ha he
massing of he delegaes under pressure of paronage of he

Why should no an inerpreer of he law be as open o cen

Tha i has been ourageously abused for personal ends in

of age, at which time be crossed to
New»,York, and from there came to

Almost immediately he made his way
to' Volcano, where he engaged In min

he went into the cuttle businoss. In
1877 be purchased tbe (ilobe hotel,
which ho conducted fot many years,
afterwards leasing the property and re
tiring from active life. He always
took great Interest lv public matters,
and was supervisor for this district
for two successive terms of four years
each.
lv 1853 Mr Dwyer was niHrrietl to
Miss^Annie Him Icy, and their union
was blesged with seven obildren of
whom four are living, namely: Wil

Matrimonial Boom. \k
The little Orthodox Greek church
on tbe Jackson. Gate road was th«>
sceno of a marriage boom yesterduy
morning such as has never before
been witnessed in this county. A
priest of the orthodox faith, Key. T.
N. Fosbkovsky, made a special trip
from SarT Francisco to gratify the
trinity of couples that were anxious to
be united in wedlock. . Three brides
and grooms were in church at the
same time to get married, in this
unexampled muster tbe Greek church
is entitled to tbe premium.
'ihe church was well filled by the
fiiends of the contracting parties,
and a number who were not of that
religions faith, who gathered out of
curiosity to witness the trio of wedd-
The first couple to the altar were
Viado Bentenlob of San Kraooisoo and
Miss Drago Kadonovich of Jackson.
The bride's attendant was Mrs (Jinvi
nioh. Unlike the -practice in otber
churches, it seems to; be the rule
with the Orthodox church that the
iiride shall be attended by a married
lady. after the cere
mony this couple left the church and
were driven in a carriage to lone,
where they took the train for San
Francisoo, where they intend to make
their home,' tbe groom being engaged
in business in the city.
Tbe second couple to be wedded
were UolubKavaoevicband Miss Uoke
Savtcb, the bridesmaid being Mrs
Ferovioh. They also left the church
aa soon as tbe marriage ceremony was
over.
The laut couple were Mackin Choro
vicb and Miss Stanor Dabovich, tbe
latter being attended by Mrs Lepe
tiob. The two last named couples
will make their homes in this city.
Very Much Alike.

"didn't you tellrne that when you was

Electoral College Figures.
The time Is at hand tor cutting out
of tbe lipwspnpcra tables of the eleo
toral rote of 190H, mid beginning to
elect presidents by tbe fascinating
process of making combinations of
the states that are deemed to be favor
ably inclined to the different candi
dates. Tbe new electoral oollege will
include forty-six states, with a total
of ■1H:1 votes, making 2112 necessary to
a choice. The college will vote as
follows:
Alabama • • 11 Nebraska • - 8
Arkansas - S) Nevada. • 3
California • 10 New Hampshire 4
Colorado • 5 New Jersey - '12
Connecticut • 7 New York - H9

A simple way to figure ou the pro
boble result is to take the "Solid
South" as the basis of the democratic
strength, and add to it the states
that Mr iiryan may be able to carry
under dillerent contingencies. Giv
ing Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland,
Delaware and Oklahoma to the Solid
South, the democracy counts .on lU9
votes in that region. It will be
necessary for Mr Bryan to secure
sevonty-thiee more' in the North.
