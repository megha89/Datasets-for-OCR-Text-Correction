Just a Bit Misty
There had been half a dozen stories
of thick fogs, but Captain Mansfield
had waited his turn with patience It
came at last, and the other captains
turned their weather beaten faces to
ward him with an expression of cheer
ful credulity
" 'Twas told me of a house setting
pretty nigh the shore along halfway
down the coast o' Maine," said Cap
tnin Mansfield "I could show you the
house if it came right It has a cu
rious lopsided portico on it, and one
flay I asked the man that lies there
why it happened to be built that queer
shape
" 'Well,' says he, 'the talk is that the
man who lied here first had a cousin
that was an architect up Boston way,
and one time the feller was down here
in a terrible foggy spell, and he was
figuring out to his cousin how he could
build a little portico of such and such
dimensions, measuring out into the
fog with his rule, and bo on
""Twas in the late afternoon; he
went off next day by train The fog
still held, and along in the morning
the man that lied here happened to
notice that the marks of the rule out
into the fog were still plain, so as he
couldn't go a fishing he took some lum
ber and built the foundations of this
portico That queer jog that makes
it lopsided is where the wind bore in
on the fog, they say, and bent the
rule marks in' "—Youth's Companion
A WeddingPersonal In Holland
A utch wedding is a curious con
trast to an English one In Holland
the wedding party enters the church
two and two, the procession being
headed by the bride and bridegroom
Forms are arranged in a semicircle
round the pulpit and there the young
people with their friends and relaties
seat themseles The ceremony con
sists of the reading of a' portion of
Scripture and a long admonition to the
bride and bridegroom, deliered extem
pore by the black gowned minister
The prayers are sat through like the
rest of the serice, for it is against
Calinistlc custom to kneel to pray
At tbe close of the serice Bibles are
presented to the young couple and to
certain of their relaties Then the
marriage is registered This free dis
tribution of Bibles, which is made by
the state, accounts for the ery small
sale there is for the Holy Scriptures
in Holland  
Nuremberg
Nuremberg, whose walls are report
ed to be showing signs of rapid decay,
was once almost the richest and most
famous town in Europe The well
known saying of Pope Pius ll— that
a Nuremberg citizen was better off
than a Scottish king— was justified by
the accounts that hae been presered
of the town and its burghers In the
fifteenth century there came from
Nuremberg the first watches known as
"Nuremberg eggs;" the first cannon,
the first gun lock, the first wire draw
ing machine, the clarinet, certain de
scriptions of pottery and the art of
painting on glass For 800 years its
now decaying walls defended the al
ley of the Pegnitz against all enemies
Four hundred towers once topped the
walls, but only about a third of them
now remain
The Millionaire Malady
Men who hae sacrificed health and
youth, scrimped their families and in
jured their digestion in the acquire
ment of a "pile" often think they are
public benefactors and that humanity
in general owes them a debt of grati
tude for being so rich In consequence
they resent as cruel injustice the fa
tigue, chagrin and newspaper notoriety
that money inariably brings in its
trail It would be about as consistent
for a little boy who had gorged himself
on purloined apples to feel Injured
when an aenging stomach ache fol
lowed gluttony— Eliot Gregory in Cen
tury
Oar Eccentric Phrases
Why do we always talk of putting on
a coat and est? Who puts on a coat
before a est? We also say putting on
shoes and stockings? Who puts on shoes
before the stockings? We also put up
signs telling people to wipe their feet
when we mean their boots or shoes
And a father tells a boy he will warm
his Jacket when he means to warm his
pantaloons We are a little eccentric
in our phrases at times
The Quail In France
In France the quail is called the bird
of prophecy, this from an idea that
the number of his calls foretells the
price of wheat If he calls twice
without resting the farmer expects but
2 francs per bnshel for his grain; if
the bird calls four times he expects
to realize twice the price which two
calls insure

LAURA KEENE'S REAM
A Vision In Slumber That Was Turn
Ed Into a Reality
Stuart Robson used to tell a strange
story ef Laura Keene, with whom he
played in the sixties in the last centu
ry "The sight of a bottle of, red ink
was enough to upset her for a week,"
he said "On one occasion we were
playing a farce called 'The Lady and
the eil' An> important scene of it
was when she was sitting at a table
preparatory to writing a letter I, as
her serant stood at the back of a
chair Take your right band off that
chair,' she whispered The stage dia
logue proceeded 'You are sure you
can find on Rafael at his lodgings?'
'Yes, madam; his serant tells me his
wounds will confine him to his bed for
a week' 'Is this the only paper that
we hae? Where is the ink?' 'Here,
madam' And I bent forward to place
the ink within her reach, when, in my
confusion at her reproof, the essel
was upset and its contents trickled
on to the lap of her satin dress The
Ink was blood red I shall neer for
get the ghastly look that oerspread
her face, and I was so frightened that
I neer knew how the scene ended  "
"The next morning at rehearsal she
told me I was doomed to 111 luck for the
remainder of my days She called trie
company together and gae them a de
tailed description of the 'awful scene'
the night before occasioned by the
young man who would neer make an
actor She told of a terrible dream she
had had in which some great person
had been foully murdered before her
eyes; how she had attempted rescue
without aail; how he had fallen dead
at her feet, and how his blood slowly
oozed into her lap It was two years
after this that Miss Keene was play
ing at Ford's theater, Washington, on
the occasion when Abraham Lincoln
was shot Miss Keene was the only
person who seemed to realize the sit
uation She ran to the box, and in b
moment the head of the dying man
was in her lap, while the scene of her
dream was being pitifully enacted"

THE TOO EARLY BIR
A Social Nuisance For Whom There
Is No Excuse
The toe early birds are a sourco of
trouble amnconenience to the entire
neighborhood
Inite the too early birds to a dinner,
and they arrie an hour before the
time
Your last little touches hae tq be
delegated to the first amiable soul who
appreciates the misery of entertaining
the too early birds You had intended
to replace a ase of carnations with
one of roses or possibly you had at the
last moment intended to shift the plate
cards, haing suddenly remembered
that Miss Jones had a quiet fancy for
Mr Smith; that Mr Smith recipro
cated ' 
Mr Smith will hae to wonder, and
Miss Jones will hae to summon up her
presence of mind and conceal her dis
appointment The too early birds must
be greeted as though you were glad to
see them and appreciated their appar
ent impatience to hae the fun begin
You really would like to gie your
hair another touch, but not so Your
guests await you
The too early birds haunt the railway
stations hours before the train leaes
and start off on the journey jaded and
out of sorts
If the too early birds are eer amia
ble it is at such a "preious" hour that
the rest of mankind is elsewhere, and
the fact is not generally appreciated
' If there Is one class of humanity
more exasperating than the too early
birds I hae yet to meet them The
man who is too late may entail incon
enience, but at least you hae the sat
isfaction of noting his discomfiture at
missing the treat through his own act
The too early birds are an infliction,
and they carry with them no compen
sating reflection whateer— Plttsburg

The Tools of the Egyptians
The ancient Egyptians had tools for
stone working equal to anything in use
today They used both solid and tubu
lar drills and straight and circular
saws The drills were set with jewels,
probably corundum, and een latho
tools had such cutting edges So re
markable was the quality of the tubu
lar drills, it is said, and the skill of
the workmen that the cutting marks
in the hard granite gie no indication
of the wear of the tool, while n cut of
a tenth part of an inch was inside in
the hardest rock at each reolution,
and a hole through both the hardest
and softest material was bornl perfect
ly smooth and uniform throughout Of
the material and method of making the
tools nothing Is known
Bon Indians Hade Ma'plsSuJar
Eer since the Indians in the section
of Vermont now known as Fletcher
discoered "honey" in the maple trees
that district has been known far and
wide as the heart of the Vermont sug
ar country The way the red men ex
tracted the delicious compound was
somewhat slow as compared with the
present process He used to cut a
slanting gash in the bark and insert
in the lower end a gauge shaped piece
of wood, from which the sap ran and
dropped into a poplar or bass wood
trough At the end of the season
these troughs would be set up against
the trees and left until the following
season, by which time the troughs
would be thoroughly mildewed
 This materially added to the flaor
of the aboriginal sugar, but can hardly
be said to hae improed it The
eaporator of those times consisted of
an Iron kettle swung from a sapling
bent oer a stump By a slow and
tert»jjs process the sap was first heat
ed and then boiled in this kettle, often
taking two or three days' boiling, be
fore it could be sugared off This was
the way in which the redskins and the
early Vermbnters eked out a "sweet
nin" of their tea and johnnycake
A Cleer French Captie
A person who was supposed to be the
French General Mouton, count de Lo
bau, was once captured by an English
essel, but after a time the captain dis
coered that, his prisoner was the
Count de Montrond "Why did you de
ceie me?" he demanded angrily of the
count "I did not deceie you," replied
Montrond; "not at all You thought I
was General Mouton You told me so
You hae a fifty gun frigate Was It
for me, who hae only a pocket pistol,
to contradict you?" '
The captain did not forgie Montrond
and took eery opportunity to treat
him rudely One eening at dinner
some one proposed the health of tbe
French As Montrond rose to acknowl
edge it the captain criedPersonal "They are all
cowards!  I make no exceptions!"
When Montrond's turn came he gae
this sentimentPersonal "The English— they are
all gentlemen, but I make exceptions"
Hotr Green Turtles Feed
The green turtles of southern Flor
ida lie in deep water and feed on sea
plants, mostly the kind called "turtle
grass," which they cut off near the
roots, eating the lower parts and lea
ing the tops floating so that it collects
in great fields and marks the spots
where the animals are to be hunted
for by the fishermen After browsing
on such ocean pastures the green tur
tles go to the mouths of riers for
baths of fresh water, which they seem
to need from time to time The Flor
ida fishermen say the reptiles enter the
creeks and roll together masses of
grass, cementing them into balls with
clay When the turn of the tide takes
the bulls out to sea they follow them
The fishermen watch for such balls
floating down the creeks, and whan
ti*ey see them they stretch nets across
the mouths of the streams and always
catch the turtles
How Pansanlns ied
*Pausanius, the Greek general, died
by self administered poison When
hotly pursued by those sent to appre
hend him on a charge of treason and
sacrilege he took refuge in the sanc
tuary of a temple/ Unable to remoe
him by force and also unwilling to
iolate the sanctuary, the officers
walled up the entrance and began to
unroof the building When he could
be seen they noticed that he was chew
ing something which proed to be a
quill filled with poison By the time
the work bad sufficiently adanced to
admit of their entrance he was in a
dying condition
The Anger Fish
The anger fish, half fish, half crab,
is the terror of all essels but iron
clads that use the south seas This
creature, which Is not bigger than an
almond, has a proboscis like an en
large gnat sting that can bore through
een sheet iron Anger fish frequent
many of the lagoons of the coral
islands and burrow" holes for them
seles in the coral, but they hae a
pererse habit of doing the same thing
to ships lying at anchor, and the dam
age generally shows Itself when next
the essel is at sea in bad weather—
with disastrous results
Molasses and Salt Poultice
What is said to be an infallible
remedy for sprains and bruises attend
ed with painful inflammation is a poul
tice of hot molasses and salt Stir the
molasses so stiff with salt that the
poultice can be held in place by a
muslin bandage and wrap the affected
parts well, so as to retain the heat as
long as possible This Is good for
beasts as well as human beings ,
Very Nice Indeed
Mrs Gadd— Wouldn't it be grand if

would be near enough to talk to, yet
not near enough to be running in at all
hours of the day, you know

Reasoning Power In Animal*
Animal Intelligence, though not nec
essarily higher In degree when they are
acting as our serants and not for their
own ends, Is then ery much more easi
ly approached and understood by us
The "point" Is a curious example of
an action In which Instinct and reason
meet The stopping of the dog, howe
er It began, has by training and heredi
ty become instinctie The dog, een
when quite a puppy, stops when It
HiipJls the game and remains almost
paralyzed, its impulse to rush In and
seize it being checked by a strong to
stlnct to stand still Yet the dog, after
he had accompanied his master and
had game shot oer him, Is quite
aware that he Is a half controlled "me
dium," and while still under the domi
nating "pointing" instinct will look
round imploringly to his master to urge
him to hurry up if the scent tells him
that the birds are moing A bordei
line action of a different kind is the
squatting of young birds is a per
fectly reasonable precaution Keeping
still and lying low are not characteris
tics peculiar only to Br"er Rabbit, but
it is most remarkable to see the way
in which tiny peewits or little teal,
hardly bigger than a fluffy bee, lie
down, put their little chins flat on the
ground and remain motionless for min
utes to aoid being seen
An Effectie Telegram
• When Senator epew was president
of the New York Central Railroad com
pany he receied a telegram which h€
presered fox a number of years and
now and then showed to his friends,
says a reminiscent writer for the Wash
ington Star This telegram reached
him one fine morning a short time be
fore Senator Platt was elected to the
United States senate for the second
time It was sent from one of the sta
tions of the New York Central and
readPersonal
Please stop the noon express here to
take on Mrs PJatt and ' MB TOO
It was a" ery unusual thing for that
train to stop at that particular station,
but Mr epew at once gae an order
to hae it done
This telegram was referred to In the
presence of Senator Platt on one occa
sion
"You see," said the senator, "I want
ed that train to stop without the least
question of doubt I knew that the
way to reach epew's heart was with
a joke, and so I sent that telegram"
A Persistent Office Seeker
Goernor Stanley of Kansas was
once so pestered by office seekers, re
lates the Saturday Eening Post, that
he found it necessary publicly to make
the statement that in iew of the ex
ceedingly numerous applications for
office he had receied through^ the
malls he should be unable to gie any
attention to them, much less afford
any hope of success to the arious ap
plicants
In the course of a few days after
making the statement in question the
goernor receied the following notePersonal
"My ear Goernor — I understand
that you hae said that you were go
ing to take a week off to destroy the
pile of letters asking for jobs If e
erything else is gone, then, my dear
goernor, I should like the job of tear
ing up the letters"
Gnnpotder and Artillery
There is abundant eidence that the
origin of gunpowder and artillery goes
far back in the dim ages of the past
The Hindoo code, compiled long before
the Christian era, prohibited the mak
ing of war with cannon and guns oi
any kind of firearms Quintus Curtlus
Informs us that Alexander the  Grcal
met with fire weapons in Asia and
Phllostratus says that Alexander's con
quests were arrested by the use of gun
powder It is also written that those
wise men who lied in the cities of the
Ganges "oerthrew their enemies with
tempests and thunderbolts shot from
the walls"— Cassell's Magazine
The Mexican Carrier
The cargador, or carrier, of Mexico
is a remarkable indiidual Nothing
seems too bulky, nothing too heay for
him to carry, and it is quite wonderful
how he manages not only to lift but
to balance his cumbersome load It is
nothing for a man to carry a load
weighing 400 pounds, this being borne
either on the top of the head or on the
shoulders and kept in place by a flat
braid passing across the forehead

A Lawyer's Apolosjry
Some years ago there was an old
Judge on the bench in Berks county
whose decisions, In consequence of nu
merous reersals, did not always com
mand uniersal respect One day in
a case in which be was sitting one of
the lawyers lost patience at his inabil
ity to see things In a certain light and
In the hoat of the moment remarked
that the Intellect of the court was so
dark a flash of lightning could not pen
etrate it For ttite contempt the judge
showed a disposition to be ery seere
with the offender, and it was only aft
er much persuasion by friends of the
latter that be yielded and decided to
accept a public apology The following
day the lawyer, accordingly, appeared
before his honor and made amends by
sayingPersonal
"I regret ery much that I said the
Intellect of the court was so dark light
ning conld not penetrate it I guess it
could It is a ery penetrating thing"
—Philadelphia Ledger
The Limit
Mr Cribbs— Mrs C, I hae borne
with resignation— nay, een cheerful
ness—antique chairs that wabbled, an
tique clocks that were always thirteen
hours behind time, antique rags that
some prehistoric Turks woe, antique
china, antique bowls, pans and kettles
All this I hae smiled at, but when you
gie me antique eggs for breakfast I
draw the line, madam— l draw the line
Troubles and Jots
The trouble with most of us is that
oar Joys seem to sink out of sight in
some inner quagmire, and onr pains
seem to take root on the thinnest soil
and flourish like the proerbial green
bay tree What is the matter with us
that a little irritation today can wipe
out in a moment all the recollection of
yesterday's glory?
Talclnar the Cake
Concerning the expression "Take the

Ireland," describing a dance In front
of a shebeen, 1b an Interesting Illustra

earth supported on Its flat end a cake,
which was to become the prize of the
best dancer The contention was car
ried on for a long time with extraordi
nary spirit At length the competitors
yielded their claims to a young man,
the son of a rich farmer in the neigh
borhood, who, taking the cake, placed
it gallantly in the lap of a pretty girl
to whom he was about to be married"
The Vendetta
The cross Is a threat of death, and
the Corsican who finds It drawn upon

WONERFUL UNANIMITY
According to tbe reasoning of Judge
Rust there will be, if anything, a re
duction Of pay to the justices and con
stables of this county by his decision,
as there was an opportunity under tbe
' fee system to pile up costs indefinitely
The ispatch hopes that the decision
will stand, and that the auditor will
accept tbe decision as final, and pay
the salary demands as they are pre
sented — Amador ispatch 
' It is not yet determined whether tbe
auditor will appeal from the decision of
the judge, but it is to be hoped that he
will not, because the consensus of opin
ion is that the law is a just one; that it
gies a fair remuneration to a public
serant, and should be enforced when
and where the makers designed— Echo
 Now that the superior court has held
that the salary should be paid, we
trust that the auditor and district attor
ney will not try to wear out the town
ship officers by appealing the case to
the supreme court We
hope that auditor Culbert and his
legal adisor can see their way clear to
gie the township officers the well
earned small salaries — Amador Record
I We publish the aboe as a psycho
logical curiosity Men Personal ersed in
mental science say that no two minds
can think alike Here we hae all
our cotemporaries dropping into the
same grooe of thought, adopting
substantially the same language, and
giing expression to their iews at
practically the same time Remark
able coincidence ! We often hear of
"two hearts that beat as one," but
the spectacle of three editors within
a radius of twele milej directing
their "hopes" simultaneously in the
same channel is a fact not to be
gauged by the ordinary laws of men
tal science Howeer suggestie it
may be in itself, it is not for us to
inquire what hypnotic spell moed
them to trael the same mental path
way The Ledger is not "in" on
this peculiar combine We must re
mark, howeer, that this identity
of thought only extends to the hope
that the justice's salary suit will not
be appealed When they start in to
gie reasons for thus hoping, their
iews become not only diergent
but actually conflicting Thus, one
writer 6ays the law gies only a fair
remuneration to a public serant
Another editor, who had the decision
inextenso before him, says there
will be, if anything, a reduction of
pay of justices and constables under
the new law Now, just fancy the
township officers, some of whom
were resigning and declining under
the'old law because it did not gie
enough compensation, actually start
i'A nandamus proceedings in their
auxiety to collect under the new law
wliich effects a reduction in their
pay ? Was eer such a selfsacrific
ing spirit known before In justice
to the logic of the decision itself,
we beg to state that the document
nowhere entures the opinion that
the pay of the justice is likely to be
cut down by the salary scheme It
does discuss how few cases it would
take under the fee system to make
more than the salary proided by the
act in controersy Into this do
main, howeer, it is inadisable to
pursue the subject
Our contemporaries seem to look
at the matter — like a lawyer arguing
a case— from a onesided standpoint!
They talk of tbe hardship that will
be entailed upon the officials directly
concerned by^ appealing the case
They do not stop to consider what
hardship may possibly result to in
nocent parties from a failure to ap
peal Justices and constables are
under bonds If they draw money
from the county treasury that they
are not legally entitled, to, they are
liable on their official bonds for the
amount thereof Is it just and
right to throw upon these bondsmen
the ultimate responsibility of a fail
ure to take the case to the court of
last resort Suppose the matter is
allowed to rest, so far as Amador is
concerned, in its present indecisie
shape, and that township officers
are permitted under the judgment
of the trial court to draw the salaries
proided for in the act And sup
pose some other county appeals the
matter to the supreme court, and
that tribunal finally holds that the
constitution is a bar to the claim of
present incumbents for salary under
the act Into what a delightful con
dition of confusion this would plunge
things? Who would be called upon
to refund the money so illegally paid
out? Would not the responsibility
attach all along the line— the treas
urer for paying the warrants, the
auditor for issuing the same, and
finally the justices and constables as
the beneficiaries of the illegal pay
ments In this dilemma, the path
of safety for all concerned lies in set
tling the question as quickly as pos
ble by an appeal to the supreme
court If the matter calls for a set
tlement by the courts at all, it is in
cumbent to stop at no halfway meas
ures, but to settle it so that it will
stay settled

  Matron Takes Hia Life while espon
dent Oer His Wife's Illness
The Examiner of the 19th contains
the following relatie to the sad end of
one of Jackson's oldest and most re
spected citizensPersonal { ,
Unable to bear the prospect of a dis
solution of the marital ties which had
bound him for 64 years, threatened by
the serious illness of his wife, ;  
Matson, 86 years of age, a pioneer and
well known resident of Jackson,' Ama
dor county, took his own life shortly
before 9 o'clock on the night ol July 18
by shooting himself in the right temple
with a reoler I ,
As was his yearly custom, he had
come to Oakland to escape trio intense
heat of bis home, and he was isiting
his grandson, Frank Poulter, of San
Pablo aenue, between 43d and 45th
streets
For some time his own health had
been gradually declining as the result
of chronic heart disease, and, added to
this trouble, bis wife was stricken with
pneumonia about four weeks ago As
tbe wife improed, howeer, the hus
band grew worse, until yesterday, when
in a fit of despondency, ho remarked to
his grandsonPersonal "Frank, it has come to
the point when I hae to lie standing
or not at all" Yet tbe old man ap
peared to be bearing up braely, when
on his crutches he hobbled to the
bedside of his wife and j tried to soothe
and cheer her %> Personal
It was not ten minutes after he had
left the bedroom that Poulter heard a
shot at the front of the house, and,
rushing out, found his sranfather hud
dled in a puddle of blood on the porch
steps, with a bullet wound in his right
temple He bad eidently propped
himself against the porch with his
crutches, and fired tbe reoler while
in that position
The following note, in the handwrit
ing of tbe deceased, was found in his
pocketPersonal
I want no inquest, as this U a olun
tary act to get out of misery  I want
to be cremated I thank you all May
good health be yours My condition is
such I must go God bless them I
can't stand this ordeal This deed must
be done God bless the dear friends/

Amateur Baseball Game
Last Sunday the people were treated
to lots of fun in witnessing a game of
baseball between two improised nines
gathered from ihe business places of
Jackson, and dubbed the Hostlers and
the Biscuit Slingers The noelty of
the contest combined with the genial
weather drew a large crowd to the
grounds, the grand stand being filled
with lady onlookers The game was
not exciting on account of the rial
teams being eenly matched, as it was
eident early in the game that the
Hostlers were hustlers, and outclassed
their opponents Still there was a
liely interest manifested in the play,
and both sides displayed a deftness in
handling the ball that commanded the
plaudits of the spectators At the
close of the eighth innings the Biscuit
team concluded that the battle was a
hopeless one, and resigned, the score
standing 20 to 13 in faor of the Host
lers Both sides were pretty well
fagged at the close, and were glad to
get back to town and partake of re
freshments liberally proided for ic
tor and anquished alike
uring the game each player receied
his portion of the joshing which was
constantly going on, and the umpire
did not fail to get bis share as well
Taken as a whole the game was aboe
expectations, and the crowd was well
satisfied with the two hours' amuse
ment A return game is expected one
week from next Sunday The Biscuit
Slingers will hae strengthened their
team by that date, and will go in to
win
Amador Lumber for Australia
The Amador Lumber Company has
contracted for 250,000 feet of sugar pine
lumber to be shipped to Australia The
first instalment of this order was for
warded from lone last week, consisting
of 60,000 feet Some of the finest sugar
pine to be found anywhere exists in the
forests of Amador county This lum
ber commands a high price, both at
home and abroad Notwithstanding
the high cost of transportation, owing
to distance from railroad and seaboard,
this kind of lumber is bound to come
into market sooner or later There is
a great demand for building lumber in
Australia, there being a total absence
of soft woods in that country In the
eent of this initial shipment proing
satisfactory, it may lead to the opening
up of a large and profitable trade in
that class of lumber, The Amador
Lumber Company's sawmill is kept
running steadily, turning out lumber
in larger quantity than heretofore
There has been no hitch in the output
so far, and the season promises to be
an unusually prosperous one Teams
are hauling the product to the yard
on Sutter hill, to the lone depot, and
to the arious mines of the mother
lode

BOAR OF EQUALIZATION
Only Two Applications for Reduction of Asess
ment, and Both enied
The county fathers met as a board of
equalization on Monday, July 20; all
the members being present
The minutes of the preious meeting
were read and approed
A Caminetti appeared in behalf of
the application of W A Neills, for a
reduction of the assessment on the
Moore mine, near Jackson, from $35,000
to $20,000
W A Neills was sworn and exam
ined in Eupport of the application He
said the property was in the same con
dition it was a year ago; no deelop
ment work done, no improements
made It was held under an agricul
tural title, and therefore bad no extra
lateral rights The improements
made years ago were delapidated and
out of date; they wr>ro a s?essed at $5,000,
he would sell them for $1000
Assessor Marchant stated that the
aluation this year was based on the
sale of the property last year, when it
was sold to Mr Neills for $70,000; the
assessment was made at 50 per cent of
the alue as determined by that sale
Mr Neills explained the reasons that
led him to bid up the property to those
figures; be had to bid it in to protect
his interests in other directions; he
and his partner owned foursixths of
the mine; so that be had only to put
up twosixths of the purchase price in
cash, representing the interest held by
the opposing bidders The sale was in
no way a fair criterion of the alue of
the property
A Caminetti addressed the board at
length in faor of the reduction asked
He compared the assessment in this in
stance with the aluation placed upon
other mining property,' showing that
some fully equipped mines were assessed
for far less than the Moore property
He was not blaming the assessor for
dealing leinently with these mines; he
belieed it was the right course to pur
sue But he did contend, in face of
all the facts, that the application for a
reduction in the case under considera
tion should be granted 
On motion of  Burke the matter
was continued until halfpast 1 o'clock
The petition of John H Springer,
asking for a reduction on the Wildman
Gold Mining Company from $85,000 to
$50,000 was then taken up The petition
stated that the trust deed coering this
property, and which was assessed for
its face alue of $85,000, was of the ac
tual alue of $50,000, and the reduction
was asked under the rule that the se
curity should not be assessed at a alu
ation in excess of the property gien as
stcurity
By a unanimous ote of the board
the application was denied
At adjournment was then taken until
130 pm
Upon reconening MNewman moed
that the petition of W A Neills be
granted The motion was not seconded
M Newman then moed that the
assessment be reduced to $25,000; sec
onded by L Burke Motion lost by the
following otePersonal Ayes— Newman, Burke
Noes— Atnick, Grillo, Moore
No further business appearing the
board adjourned sine die
[The careful reader will not fail to
notice from the aboe report that no
official action has been taken on the
Neills' petition; that petition was nei
ther granted nor rejected; it was neer
put to a ote It stands practically in
the same position that it did before the
board met; and the board has ad
journed sine die without disposing of
the business on hand We do not pre
tend to know the legal effect of this
failure Upon inquiry, we hae been
informed that upon reassembling in the
afternoon the board held one of those
socalled "executie" sessions which
hae become a feature of late What
was done at this priate meeting of a
public body we know not Probably
in the mixup between tho orthodox
and hetrodox method of doing business
the official disposition of the petition
was oerlooked

jerked the cart quite forcibly In the
meantime Ollie had taken hold of the
gun with one hand to steady it when
Winters got out When the cart was
jerked it threw the gun upward and
backward, the trigger caught on the
edge of the seat and discharged one
barrel, the full charge striking young
Robereou in the face and killing him
instantly The other boys did not at
first realize what had happened, think
ing Ollie bad fired at a doe, he haing
made no sound or utterance when shot
As soon as the truth was learned the
unfortunate boy was coneyed by his
companions to the Roberson home

A Pen Picture of Queen Anne
Those outside of a palace may feel
Shakespeare's sentiment, "There's such
diinity doth hedge a king," but it is
hardly possible to those inside One
of the Scotch commissioners to nego
tiate a union between Scotland and
England, Sir John Clerk, could not
hae felt it during an official Interiew
with Queen Anne, of whom he gies
fhis realistic picturePersonal
"Her majesty was laboring under a
flt of the gout and in extream pain and
agony, and on this occasion eerything
about her was much in the same dis
order as about the meanest of her
subjects Her face, which was red
and spotted, was rendered something
frightful by her negligent dress, and
the foot affected was tied up with a
pultis and some nasty bandages
"I was much affected at this sight,
and the more when she had occasion to
mention her people of Scotland, which
she did frequently to the duke What
are you, poor, meanllke Mortal,
thought I, who talks in the style of a
Soereign?
"Nature seems to be inerted when a
poor, infirm Woman becomes one of the
Rulers of the would, but as Tacitus ob
seres it is not the first time that Wom
en hae goerned in Britain, and in
deed' they hae sometimes done this
to better purpose than the Men"
Six Follies of Science
The six follies of science arePersonal (1) The
squaring of the circle, (2) perpetual
motion, (3) the philosopher's stone, (4)
the elixir of life, (5) magic and (C) as
trology
In all ages men of undoubted ability
hae tolled early and late to unrael
the mysteries supposed to be connected
with these fascinating problems It is
not always remembered that such in
tellectual giants as Bacon, Sir Robert
Boyle and Sir Isaac Newton sought
the philosopher's stone, which, strange
to say, receies some countenance
from the modern theory of allotropy
In the study of astrology Lilly was for
a time een pensioned by parliament
Most of these "follies" conferred in
direct benefits upon science, for in
seeking one thing their deotees dis
coered many another The craze for
the secret, or unknown, has still its
hold upon men and is seen in palmistry
and kindred cults— London Standard
A Joke O'Rell idn't Appreciate
Max O'Rell was booked to lecture in
Hartman's hall in Grand Rapids a
number of years ago Carroll Hart
man was haing a serious time in in
ducing the people of the alley city to
see tbe merits of lecturers
There was a big sale for the O'Rell
lecture and Hartman wandered oer
to the Morton House In the afternoon
to call on tbe French wit; also to pay
him his fee of $100 
"But I hae not deliered the lecture
yet Suppose I should die before to
night," said O'Rell, who could not un
derstand why a manager should pay
for something not yet deliered
"Oh, that's all right I'd exhibit
your corpse," replied Hartman The
witty Frenchman neer recoered from
the shock of Hartman's remark At
any rate, he refused to lecture In Grand
Rapids again— etroit Free Press
Tbe Simple Coast Folk"
The Newfoundland coast folk are
"wreckers" as well as fishermen— not
wreckers in the criminal sense, but ex
pert workmen In stripping and unload
ing the hulls that are tossed up against
the" frowning cliffs Eery fisherman
can turn his hand to this labor, which
frequently pays better than his regular
ocation, and salage schooners find
permanent employment there with di
ers and hoists, recoering from the
oozy depths the treasures of the sub

"So I am"
"Yet you told me just now you were
"Yes; so I did"
"Well, what is the matter with you?"
"Nothing, sir My name is Single,
and I'm married Good day, sir"
The Value of Solitude
Solitude, the safeguard of mediocrity,
is to genius the stern friend, the old,
•obscure shelter, where molt the wings
which will bear It farther than sun
and stars He who would inspire and
lead his race must be defended from
traeling with the souls of other men,
from liing, breathing, reading and
writing In the daily time worn yoke of
their opinion— Emerson
Better Than Art
"Yes," said Auber, the artist, pat
ronizingly, "I'm selling my canases
now at my own prices"
"You don't say?' replied Sharpley,
whoso works had not yet caught on
"Yes, Indeed I suppose you'd gie
a good deal to be a great artist"
"No, indeed I'd rather be you"Ex

Not only was he in social intercourse
one of the most courteous and sweetest
of friends, but he was in manner one
of the most fascinating and impressie
beings whom I eer met I hae
talked with Carlyle and Tennyson,
With Victor Hugo and Mazalnl, with
Raribaldl and Gambetta, with John
bright and Robert Browning, but no
one of these eer impressed me more
iidly with a sense of Intense person
ality, with the inexplicable light of
genius that seemed to well up spon

remains a psychological puzzle how

Mow a Rat Stole Bulbs
M de Parllle, a well known French
naturalist, told a remnrkable story
about a rat in the Journal dcs ebats
A gardener planted one afternoon 250
tulip bulbs on a terrace, and npxt
morning he noticed that the ground
had been disturbed and that they had
all been taken away He I was con
fident that rats had done the work,
and, taking a spade, he began to dig
in the hope of discoering their nest
Soon he unearthed a large female rat,
which he killed, and after digging a
few more minutes he discoered an
underground chamber lined with hay
and leaes and connected by a corri
dor with two holes, which were ei
dently used as storehouses, for in them
he found the 250 tulip bulbs This
was remarkable, but more remarkable
was the fact that they were neatly ar
ranged in two rows and that not one
of them had been gnawed or other
wise Injured
He Looked It
A ridiculous but amusing story used
to be told of Charles Reade's dramati
zation of Tennyson's poem, "ora"
We do not, howeer, ouch for the
truth of the anecdote "ora" was be
ing performed one night years ago,
and when Mary Morrison made her
exit to bring on her little Willie, aged
about four, she was shocked to find a
lubberly boy of at least fourteen, and,
as he was the only Willie at hand, on
he had to go, though he was well nigh
as big as his mother The Former Allen
of the play, being equal to the emer
gency, instead of inquiring, "How old
are you, my little man?" endeaored
to remedy the matter by saying, "How
old are you, my strapping boy?" But
it was a failure, for the boy, who was
Instructed to say from "four to fie,"
said it in such a hoarse, sepulchral
tone as to drie the good natured
grandfather to exclaim, "Fortyflel

Cheerfulness is a duty one owes to
oneself as well as to one's neighbors,
for nothing so ' unfits one for the or

There are plenty of artificial aids to
cheerfulness within the reach of eery

of duty strie systematically to achiee
good humor by repeating oer and

humorous poetry you know If con
scientiously administered this prescrip

doubt it just try the experiment
Surial of a Custom
On gateposts you will frequently find
a stone ball Who would eer suppose
that the balls on the gateposts were
the heads of family enemies? It was
once the custom to stick your enemy's
gory head as a trophy on the gatepost
On tho gates of towns were stuck the
heads of traitorous persons In old
London, for instance, the bridge gate
and Tf raple Bar were always decorated
with ghastly relics of the kind, and the
memory of the custom suries on the
gateposts of modern suburban illas

That Kfcd Neer Occurred to Htm
When Lafayette isited' Loudoun
connty he was entertained with the
other eminent guests by President
Monroe at Oak Hill Leesburg, too,
the historic town nine miles from Mon
roe's country seat, accorded him hon
ors on that occasion, and at a dinner
at that town John Qulncy Adams de
liered a famous toast to the suriing
patriots of tbe Reolution, who, he
said, were like the sibylline leaes—
the fewer they became the more pre
cious they were
On the return to Oak Hill another of
Monroe's guests said to Mr AdamsPersonal
"Excuse the impertinence, but would
you not tell me what Inspired the beau
tiful sentiment of your toast today?"
"Why," replied Mr Adams, "it was
suggested this morning by the picture
of the sibyl that hangs in the hall of
the Oak Hill mansion"
"How strange," remarked the less
brilliant guest, "I hae looked at that
picture many times during the past
years and that thought neer occurred
to me"— Leslie's Monthly
Chewing ry Rice,
"A strange way of testing the inno Personal
cence of an accused person is employed
in India," said a Philadelphia mer
chant who lately returned from Mad
ras "They haul the man up and gie
him a mouthful of dry rice to chew I
don't suppose you eer chewed dry
rice? Well, it is hard work It takes a
deal of chewing to get it masticated
Into a glutinous mass like gum, and
that Is the condition that tbe accused is
required to get It Into within ten min
utes If you are calm and not afraid
you succeed, but if you are nerous and
scared you fail, for it seems that feai
has a strong effect upon the saliary

Reptiles That 'Walk Erect
Lizards jof seeral sorts can walk
and run easily on their hind legs The
Australian water lizard, which is three
or four feet in length, keeps quite erect
when traersing long distances on
land It is found In the neighborhood
of rier banks, and passes much of its
time in shallow water 
The frilled lizard of Queensland also
traels on Its hind legs on leel ground,
keeping the frill folded when running
When attacked it expands this fold of
skin, which stands out like a ruff at
right angles round the neck, giing it
a most formidable aspect, so that dogs
that attack and kill larger lizards will
often retreat before a frilled lizard at
bay
There Is also a tree lizard in Austra
lia that moes In a similar way All
these species walk on all fours when
merely moing about or going short
distances , Personal
Children o Lie
o children lie? Yes; constantly,
persistently and uniersally, says the
Kindergarten Magazine A child does
not tell the truth because he could not
He does not know the truth, and his
approximation to tbe truth is ery
much aguer than ours And there are
certain qualities of his mind which
make It Ineitable that he should per
ert the truth In the first place, truth
la synonymous with knowledge  He
does not know what truth is In the
second place (and it is the same with
us), children gradually approximate
the truth They hae their ideas of
truth In the third place, the child's
Imagination dries him often to tell
what is not true
Brain Work and Hair
Eerything physical being equal, it
is established that the man who is en
gaged in professional work will grow
gray j sooner than will the man who
earns his bread by the literal sweat of
his brow Thus by implication the man
who has more and harder brain work
than another— more worries, more
troubles, more difficult thoughts, less
itality in proportion— this Is the indi
idual and the profession that soonest
are marked by gray hairs
Woman's Cruelty to 'Woman
Another illustration of how mean a
woman can be was gien' the other
night when a young lady was calling
on an elderly spinster who dresses and
acts with unbecoming youthfulness
The spinster showed her isitor a beau
tiful handmade lace collar and said
proudly, "This Is oer fifty years old"
•It is beautiful!" purred the girl
"Md you make it, dear?"New York

In Mediaeal Cities
There can be no doubt that one ren
eon why cities did not grow so rapidly
la the seenteenth and eighteenth cen
turies as in tho nineteenth is the ex
cessiely high death rate that pre
ailed during the earlier period The
flood of immigration, mighty as it was,
did little more than make good the
places of those citizens who fell ic
tims to grieous sanitary conditions
From the facts that can bo obtained
it seems to hae been uniersally true
that almost up to the beginning of the
nineteenth century the death rate of
large cities exceeded the birth rate
This was not because the birth rate
was abnormally low, but because the
death rate was abnormally high In
the mediaeal city both birth rate and
death rate were far higher than at
present Infant mortality must hae
mounted to a grewsome height The
uncleanliness and oercrowding of city
dwellers, now largely relegated to the
slums of our great cities, was the nor
mal state of nearly all classes of so
ciety In the London and Paris of Louis
and Elizabeth— Professor Edwin O
Jordan In Popular Science Monthly
Consul Kins aid
This amusing anecdote of Lamartine
is related by the Baroness Bonde in
her olume of lettersPersonal Shortly after
the reolution of February be wrote
on the blank leaes of his pocketbook
the names of his protegees and sent
the list to be proided with places Im
mediately Preiously, howeer,! it
seems, he had scribbled "aid" on
the page, and the head of the cabinet
appointed the said aid consul at
Bremen; the postulant, howeer, neer
came forward, and, though the poet did
not like being disturbed, M Hetzel
was obliged to ask who was the aid
on his list  
"He who danced before the ark,"
was the answer
•"Oh, dear! I hae gazetted him to
Bremen!"
"How ery singular! I meant him
for a subject for meditation, not for
nomination But you can cancel It"
The moniteur registered the change,
but few knew that the last consul ap
pointed to Bremen was King aid! ;
Wonderful Sense of Smell In ogs
It has often been proed that dogs
are able to track their masters through
crowded streets, where Personalit would be
Impossible to attribute their accuracy
to anything except the sense of smell
alone Mr Romanes, the naturalist,
once made some Interesting experi
ments as to this wonderful power as
exhibited in his own dog  In these tests
the naturalist found that his dumb
friend could easily follow In the tracks
of his master, though he was far out
of sight, and that, too, after no less
than eleen persons had followed, step
ping exactly in the tracks made by Mr
Romance, It being the deliberate Inten
tion to confuse the senses of the poor
dog If possible Further experiment
proed that the animal tracked j the
boots Instead of the man, for when Mr
Romanes put on new footgear the dog
failed entirely
aigerott Symptoms
The story is told of a Scotch preacher
who gae his people long, strong ser
mons and deliered them in a remark
ably deliberate manner | One Sunday
he asked a friend who was isiting
him to occupy his pulpit In the morning
"An' were you satisfied wi' my
preaching?" asked his friend as they
walked home from the kirk
"Weel," said his host slowly, "it was
a fair dlscoorse,  Will'm; a fair dls
coorse, but it pained me at the last to
see the folk looking so fresh and wide
awake I mistrust 'twasna sac long
nor sac sound as it should hae been"
European Tattooera
Tattooing is not by any means con
fined to saagfe peoples ' There are
races In Europe which make it a regu
lar practice, and men, women and chil
dren bear on their bodies ornamenta
tions that are as ornate and queer, al
though not as extensie, as are mark
ings on the bodies of the south sea
saages
These European tattooers are among
the Albanians and Bosnians, who lie
in the famous and notorious Balkan
peninsula S?***?3
Had Seeral Mark Coming
"I hope that Willie got a good mark
at school today," remarked Willies
fond mother
"He did not, madam, I am sorry to
say," replied the grim isaged peda
gogue politely, "but I think I am safe
in promising you that If Willie turns
up at school tomorrow, which he did
not do today, he will receie seeral"

been that they wanted to borrow Gie
