dangers, and if they were not gifted
with peculiar yet useful instincts they
would fall ready ictims to their ene
mies' Chattering  monkeys and big
snakes steal and eat their eggs, while
their offspring are preyed upon  by
foes on eery side But it takes a sly
monkey o* snake to 'get ahead of the
tailor bird, a small East Indian sing
ing bird She hides her nest so skill
fully that her enemies cannot find it
no matter how hard they try This
she does by using her long, slender
bill as a needle Personal With the tough fiber
of a parasite plant abundant  in—the
tropics as a thread she sews a dead
leaf  taken from the ground to a li
ing one near the end of a slender and
hanging branch, and between these
leaes she builds her nest, where nei
ther monkey nor snake can approach,
because the branch will not bear their
weight

that the increase is greatest and most
rapid during the first and second years
of life, its bulk at the end of the sec
ond year being exactly double what It
originally was  Between the second
and seenth "years it is again doubled
In size A slower rate of growth then
sets in and continues during the period
of maturity of other portions of the
body After the fifteenth year up to
the fiftieth the annual growth of the
heart is about 001 of a cubic inch,
the Increase ceasing about the fiftieth

EITORIAL PERILS
The preailing idea that an editor
and publisher, is such, can be held
criminally responsible only for the
appearance in the columns of hjs
paper of a malicious and libelous
article, must be reised, according
to the march of eents in Amador
county within the past two weeks
Newspaper men throughout the
state will do well to take heed to the
new legal snags which hae been
planted for their particular benefit,
and which their enemies may use in
an emergency for their undoing A
country editor without enemies is a
man who is without conictions, or
who lacks the courage to express
them One who tries to do his duty
is bound to hae a few eilwishers
ou the alert to entrap him on any
flimsy pretext that may present it
self This may be taken as a com
pliment, and almost inariably does
work to his adantage in the long
run; all the same it is a source of
annoyance and expense for the time
being The powers that be i Ama
dor county hae laid down the
principle that any item published in
a newspaper, whether on personal
knowledge or on secondhand infor
mation, has all the force of a sworn
statement, as far as the responsibili
ty of the editor is concerned A
copy of the paper itself containing
the article, can thereafter be made
to do duty in a criminal prosecu
tion, in lieu of the corpus delicti;
also as absolute proof of the identity
of the writer, and conclusie ei
dence of the truth of the statements
contained therein This farreaching
legal effect of a news item is a phase
of journalism neer before contem
plated If uniersally adopted it
would be a bombshell in the ranks of
the fraternity neer before exploded
in this country since the declaration
of independence Such is journal
istic life in the far west, as practi
cally exemplified in Amador county
This is about the funniest proposi
tion of the legion of funny happen
ings in local jurisprudence in many
years The deer case in its other
phases will come within the puriew
of the press shortly At present it
would be out of place to discuss it,
but we hae no doubt it is, in its
manysided features, commanding a
full share of public discussion
throughout the county
CHANGE OF POLICY
A sudden and ' radical change or
policy affecting the reenue or social
status of county, state or nation, is
to be deprecated' The country at
large has been discussing for seeral
years past the adisability of modi
fying the tariff laws It is admitted
that such laws need changing from
time to time to meet the require
ments of changing circumstances
A tariff schedule, wisely arranged
and beneficent i its operation to
day, may be out of joint and op
pressie in the altered conditions of
a year hence This is admitted
There is no fixity of such laws that
will apply with equal force to all pos
sible conditions TheyPersonal are merely
temporary policies, intended to ap
ply to certain conditions; when the
conditions change,^ a reision or
modification of the policy becomes
imperatie But een when this
necessity arises, it is the path of
wisdom to aoid  any sweeping
change To aert a iolent disturb
ance of financial affairs, the modifi
cation must be gradually and almost
imperceptibly , accomplished The
country passes from the old to the
new order of things without serious
detriment to any material interest
When the democrats succeeded in
electing a president and congress, a
radical departure in fiscal policy was
inaugurated From a high protect
ie tariff, the administration pro
posed to drift to tariff for reenue
only, withdrawing the protectie
feature under which many infant in
dustries were struggling to a sound
bash We know the result A panic
and financial crash spread through
the country The threatened in
terests, in seeking coer, went tot
tering to the wall Years of fam
ished industries and hard times, for
the laboring classes interened, and
continued until the jj policy of pro
tection was again triumphant at the
polls  ;   
The idea herein coneyed of dis
aster incident to a iolent change of
policy, is applicable to county af
fairs • A moement is on foot to
make a sweeping change in local
policy The moement, we doubt
not, is prompted by the, best p of
moties It' aims to promote J the
moral and, material welfare/ of^the
county >The object is to control the
number of saloons ,No one*will dis
pute that' the number ' is ' fr in ex
cess of a reasonablejimit The sys
tem has grown up, howeer, under
the fostering care of the local go
ernment  It is the outcome of a low
license system which has always held
sway 'No doubt it would hae been
better if a different policy had, been
adopted at the outset/ But the dif
ficulty now facing us, is how to
remedy the eil' without' bringing
upon the community other eils, per
haps not 1 one whit less disastrous
than those now existing It is well
to consider the matter, in all its
bearings before taking acfton What
would be the probable effect if a
sharp turn were taken? How would
property, interests f be affected?
What might happen in'; the; way of
the principal^ towns Cof the county
adopting self goernment, thereby
taking the regulation of such mat
ters out of the hands of the county
authorities? If this were done, how
would it affect  the income for the
support of the county organization
While recognizing, therefore, the
need of reform, it behooes those in
charge to make haste slowly, taking
a broadside iew 5f the situation
before moing at all j
The strike at the Royal mine at
Hodson, in Calaeras county, has
assumed a threatening aspect' The
strikers hae resorted to iolence, to
preent nonunion men from taking
the places they hae acated This
is the last resort, when the contest
from the strikers' standpoint is mo
ing onward to a losing game And
yet in adopting iolent methods they
ought to know that they are only
contributing to their own defeat'
Labor unions cannot win by declar
ing war against law and order The
same tactics hae been followed in
Colorado, and while that hitherto
flourishing state has ' been, sadly
crippled industrially by the strife,
the labor organizations hae been the
principal sufferers They are strong
when they keep within legitimate
lines; ihey are weakness itself when
they defy established authority Personal

Lebarge, 13 miles, the current is less
than two miles an hour, and it was 6 in
the morning when we reached the jetty
built by the Canadian goernment, to
make a channel deep enough forsteam
ers, through the shoals at the head of
the lake ; This was done two years
ago at a heay expense Thoengineers
in their excess of wisdom, made a new
channel for the jetty, which the water
refused to follow, but broke the barrier
and continued the old course, which
the steamers are now obliged to take,
and hae more trouble than before the
improements were made The' wind
was blowing from the north, so *c tied
up and spent the day hunting rabbits
and watching the two steamers that
had loft White Horse the eening; be
fore, and were stuck on sand bars near
by  The mud was too soft to gie any
support to the steam leers with which
all rier boats are proided, and the
only practical resource left was tho free
use of, energetic and intensely blas
phemous language In the afternoon
a boat from awson arried, and at
taching a cable to the stranded boat,
and putting all engines under full
steam, soon cleared the bar  About
 o'clock the wind began to change to
the south, so we drifted down the chan
nel and out into the lake, which is 32
miles long and from  to 10 miles wide
Soon a smart breeze faored us, and
the sail carried us at a good rate for a
couple of hours, when the wind changed
again and a thunderstorm droe down
from the north > We succeeded in
reaching a 6inall coe on the east side
of the lake, and as the wind continued
after the rain had passed, we wont
ashore, built a great fire of drift wood,
dried oursoles, and tried to imagine
how Eneas and his followers felt after
their shipwreck The women were
comfortable under a tarpaulin on board
the barge It was  the next after
noon before tho lake was calm enough
to enture further, but we feasted on
rabbits and milk, and wore happy
The wind being contrary wo kept close
to the shore, two men walking alon"
the beach and pulling a line, while the
others stayed on board, and with' long
poles pushed the craft forward About
midnight we were all tirod, and went
to sleep The next day a strong breeze
from the south faorod us, and we set
the sail The wind increased and wo
made splendid time, but a few miles
from the foot of the lake we were drien
back by another thunderstorm and had
to run ashore again On the eening
of the fourth day on the lake we reach
ed its foot, ' and wore drawn into the
head of Thirty Mile rier as though
there was no such thing as delay The
places where I had been stranded or
wrecked three years  ago seemed like
old acquaintances, but not dear enough
to merit a call Our craft was so easily
managed that the 18 miles of rapids
were almost like shooting the chutes
At 11 we called at Hootalinqua, and
learned that some idiot had reported
that wo were all drowned Wo sent a
message to our friends in Skigway, Ss
suring thorn, a la Mark Twain, that
the reports of our death had boon
greatly exaggerated, and on* we went
For a gigantic picnic this sort of a trip
cannot bo surpassed The rapida of
Fie Fingers, Rink and Hell Gate, wore
just exciting enough to be interesting,
nothing more Our only accident oc
curred when rounding a bend in the
Lewes rier An oerhanging tree
caught out mast, but the stout fir stick
was so strong it stopped tho boat One
man was knocked off the upper deck
and somewhat bruised, one woman
sprained her ankle in trying to get out
of his way, and a stoe was swept off
into the rier, whore it still remains
We made no stop at Selkirk or Ogllie,
and arried at awson on the morninff
of the 26th ,

been done 'The terms upon which the
strike was terminated were satisfactory
aU round The two men, whose re
instatement the union insisted upon in
the first place,' and which precipitated
the trouble, announced that they did
not want, to return to work;"  w Tbiß
paed the w>y to an understanding, as
the company neer had , any> objection
toihe return '> of > the other employes
So the men applied for work £ Wednes
day morning, and operations were re
sumed Many of tho old hands had left
for other parts, or had secured employ
ment elsewhere There was no trouble
about getting men Indeed, there were
more applications than they had places
to fill, as there  has  been an influx of
miners to this ' section from Colorado
and other labor troubled states * This
settlement of the strike is hailed with
pleasure throughout the county;*" It
will tend to Personal reestablish confidence
among mining inestors, as showing
that the unions realize that radical
measures will not be tolerated;  that a
conseratie and conciliatory course,
recognizing Personal to the fullest exteut the
right of employers to take on or' dis
charge men without dictation from any
source, is tbe only safe path to pursue
Tax Payments 'X
 The payment of tlie first instalment
of state and county taxes for the cur
rent year is aboe the aerage While
all the townships show up exceedingly
well, township two is entitled to the
banner for the smallness of Its delin
quent list The sum of $1,1759 has
been receied from that section,
through J W Surface & Son This
includes $316 receied on account of
the special high school tax This tax
is all due on payment of the first in
stalment ; The semiannual payment
feature does not apply to special school
taxes Not more than $300 remains
outstanding on this high school tax'
This is a trifle less than 10 per cent of
the whole amount, and is a flattering
shpwing at this stage of lax collodions'
Notwithstanding thePersonal heay lax rate,
the eollijiilous show up aboe the aer
age throughout the I county, and the
outlook is faorable for a much lower
rate nnxt year on account of tho heay
payments made on the reilomption of
delinquent property  Tim amount re
ceied from this source is far in excess
of the aggregate amount receied ; dur

 An  Allay Trial Ends in a is'i
>Personal';''Personal ;;>S reeln  ent  ;  f XX Personal '
The weighty case of people s Rich
ard Webb accused of haing deer meat
in his possession in closed season,, was
heard before Justice Goldner on  Mon
day last The • trial was held  in ; the
superisor's room in the hall of records,
as the interest taken in the proceedings
was such that the usual' justice* court
room was ' too ' contracted* to'accom
modate the spectators •";' A' r yenue was
issued for 30 jurors" The entire  mor/n
ing session was occupied in securing! a
jury; ' Finally ; the following named
twele men were sworn to try the case;

HamrfcW, WEPersonal;Speer,;T,' Schwartz,
A' HPersonal Kuhlman; W/ E" Kent," RPersonal W
Ketcham, J Wilson, J  Mason,' and

The district attorney, C P'Vicini,
was on hand to conduct the prosecu
tion,' and C H Crocker appeared for
the defendant The proceedings "wore
of tho most farcical nature, i" Probably
neer in the history of Amador county
—and we beliee the remark will apply
to the state— wassuch a case yen til a ted
before a jury! or 'the rules of eidence
cast aside with such scant considera

whole trial was an objection to tbo in
trodudtiod of testimony as irreleant,
made in behalf of 'the defendant, sus
tained by tbe'eourt ' Eerything teut
in [We may hereafter comment upoc
some of the  features of r this remark
able case — remarkable  in more, ways
than one— but for the present we shall
content ourseles with a brief narration
of thVTacts Personal••*• j  
L N Kercheal, a state deputy, was
the Best witness ;Personal He, it was who swore
to the complaint, and made the arret
He traeled 200 miles for this purpose
And he swore to the complaint | not, on
information, but of his own knowledge
The complaint charged that defendant
had deer meat in his possession on or
about the 20th of Noember/?? Jn'testi
fying, howeer,  he admitted that' he
neer saw the defendant until' the" thi
of ecember when he made, the arrest
That all he knew was what , he saw in
the Amador Ledger of , No 27 •He
first saw the paper {n the office of, C
Vogelsang," thePersonal chief ; deputy,'; in" San
Francisco SHe neer* saw' any 'deer
meat in defendant's possession,' and did
not know whether he eer had any 5 or
not 7 He was notundor, bonds Personalw;
O H Reichling; was^ the next wit
ness , He said, ho; went to tho ranch of
A Jones, a couple of miles west of Pine
Groe, in company with C B Arditto,
the local game warden 'He was secre
tary of the Jackson ! game association,
and also deputy game warden tinder
Arditto When asked to detail a "con
ersation he hacLwith A "Jones, Wie de
fense interposed an objection that such
was  iuadmissable, unless it  was  first
shown that tbe defendant was present
It is a wellsettled principle of law that
a defendant could * not be bound by
statements of other parties made not in
his presence The objection was brush
ed aside without ceremony  He then
said that Jones told lain that ho tpok
a piece of enison to Jackson, and left
it with ; Mrs Webb 'That he saw > Mr
Webb afterwards and told him about
it; that ho had killed 'the* deer on 'the
28th of Octobor That he had 'omitted
to tell Mr Webb tiot to _say anything
in the paper about it  Witness neer
saw deer meat in the possession of,de
fendantPersonal ' '  ,Personal;, >Personal;,,•
J S Garbarini was I next examined
He said he had a conersation with de
fendant on the eening of No 27, at
his liing rooms' Mrs' Webb \yas~presr
ent He started to josh about the arti
cle In the Ledger "Wanted to know if
it was put in to tost tho game associa
tion He said *it was not  It was | a
simple mistake on his part as  to  when
the deer was killed; he 'had no doubt
that the animal was' kl\Jed io tho open
season, and ho neglected to look at the
law as to when the open season ended
Mrs Webb spoke up and said that she
receied a parcel from Mr Jones; that
she did not ask any questions,' and did
not know what \V was; that she was
sorry on Mr Jones' account' Neer
saw any " enison in possession \of de
fendant ,"  ' \; ' "'!
A copy of I the Ledger of Noember
27th, containing the fie or six line
article r acknowledging the receipt by
tha Ledger office of a sample of
enison, was 'thereupon admitted in
eidence, against the objections of de
fense 1 This w'Ss the only, material ob
ject introduced in (eidence during the
trial' It had to do serice as occular
demonstration that a deer was actually
killed, and also that the defendant had
receied a portion of it PersonalPersonal  ;
 C B Arditto then related his story
He is game warden of Amador county,
and a deputy under the state  board
He gae a somewhat different* ersion
of the ; conersation^ith !A JonesPersonal
He said Mr Jones tokrthem he had de
liered a piece of enison at the Led
ger office to Mrs! Webb, for Mr Webb
That he afterwards met the defendant
on the street and told him about lea
ing it, and also told him the deer
weighed oer 100 pounds; Left some
for him last year, but he did not pub
lish it He had  neer seen any deer
meat in defendant's possession, and did
not know whether he had any or not
This closed the case fqr the prosecu
tion  Mr Crocker addressed the court,
and asked that the court instruct tho
jury to gie a erdict of acquittal The
prosecution had utterly failed to make*
out a prima <facie case ; The corpus
delicti had not been established No
deer meat nor estige of deer had been
produced, or traced to the defendant
or any one else From beginning to
end it was nothing but a tissue of
hearsay testimony The court of course
denied the motion
The defense then put In some testi
mony Mrs Webb, wife oi defendant,
took the stand, and stated that A
Jones called on tho 21st of Noember,"
(not the 20th as named in the com
plaint) and left a parcel, saying, ''Here's
something for you and Mr" Webb"
He did not mention enison, and of her
own knowledge she could not tell what
it was The defendant neer bad it in
his possession; neer saw it, and nee?
partook of any,' On tho following day
in tho afternoon she cookyl ; the ' meat,"
tbe defendant twingf absent, and' r par
took of a small pioce, in'rtcognition of
tho kindness of thi donor, and know
ing 'that defendant 'did not care for
such delicacy,' she ciit up the real of it
and fed it to seen, cats * She supposed'
it was enison 
" The defendant Jtook' the stand, and
testified that at no time was he in pos
session of any deer' meat* The; parcel
was neer deliered to him; he neer
saw it opened or unopened; of his own
knowledge he coiild notr ; tell that any
enispn had been receied "by anyone
connected witVthe Ledger; he could
not tell deer, meat ~ from bear meat or
any other, kind of meat 'The article
in the Lodger was based entirely on
hearsay — statements made by others —
like the ast majority of news items
The item itself did not say that the
editor receied any enison He had
neer admitted to any one that he had
receied deer meat, lie did not know
what became of it, except what he had
been told

,S Argonaut — The repairs of the
Argonaut shaft are down  close to the
water line, about the 1600 leel It is
not the intention we understand to un
water the shaft entirely, but only so
much as is necessary to enable tho two
lower leels at 100 and 16Q0 feet to be
worked The shaft work may bo said
to be nearly completed Personal There will no
doubt be considerable ;>' work in  the
leels before the milling of ore can be

A ROYAL BOOK BUYER
The Personal Purchase of 'iderot's ' Library
by Catherine 11 of Russia
Empress Catherine 11 of Russia was
a great reader "and a loer of books
One of her serices to letters in Russia
was the purchase  of the libraries of
Voltaire and iderot She was a warm
friend' and 'admirer of these French
philosophers, "and their work interested
her because, she was eager to learn new
theories of politics' and goernment
Voltaire's library  of about 7,000 ol
umes Is now a part of the Russian im
perlal library in the Hermitage palace
and In the hall deoted to it is Hou
don's statue of Voltaire
The story of Catherine's purchase o>
iderot's library is interesting, r It i»
creditable to her tact and her generos
Ity iderot named £15,000 as , th
price of  his library Catherine 11of
fered him £10,000 and named as a con
ditlon of the bargain that her purchasi
should remain with iderot until  hit
death' Thus iderot, without leaing
Paris, became Catherine's librarian ii
his own library  As her librarian b<
was gien a yearly salary of V f KXJ
One year this salary was no,, paid
Then Catherine wrote to her librariat
that she could not hae him or her li
brary suffer through the negligence "ol
a treasurer's clerk and that she should
send i him the sum that she had sel
aside for the care and increase of hei
library for fifty years At  the end ol
that period she would make new ar
rangements  A check for £25,000 , ac
companied this letter
The Literary Chap In Finance
"I know a literary chap, good writer
and all that, but  with j absolutely ' no
business sense, who suddenly decided
the thing for him to do was to start a
bank account*" said the secretary of a
financial institution ' "He came in to
see me about it I asked ' him how
much he had, and he sold he had saed
$59 I told him 'we rarely started ac
counts on', such small deposits, but
would make an exception in his case
to encourage thrift and school him in
business VPersonal •'     
 "He went through the preliminaries
nerously, , signed the signature card,
put his money in and got a nice_new
bank book By, that time he was all
flustered They gae him a^fck book,
and he decided he»would hae to hae
some money for present use The re
ceiing, teller Introduced him to the
rpaying teller, and he Inquired, the
procedure of checking out money The
paying teller explained at length Then
my literary friend went oer' to the
desk and wrote a check for his entire
$59, got the money and went out"

og and Cat
The effect of a dog on a cat's tail is
well worth study When a cat encoun
ters a strange dog the tail immediately
assumes an upright position, the back
becomes highly ; arched, and the  fur
stands out straight all oer the body
This sudden change dismays the dog,
who brings himself to a halt, and the
two regard each other steadfastly Personal 
But if the dog should turn his gaze
away for a fraction of a sqf ond there is
a swish and a bound, and the cat lias
disappeared oer a fence or up a tree
Stimulated by the presence of a dog,
/cats hae been known to climb to such
heights' that they were unable to de
scend the way they went up

A OG OF UTILITY
The Pointer's, Eolution  From the
' Bloodhound Type Personal"
Personal•; The eolution of the pointer, from
what may be described as , the  blood
hound type to the modern English
foxhound kind has • taken, perhnps,
close on 150 years He is essentially,
aboe all others, a dog of utility * and
as the pointer has always been looked
upon as one of the chief helpmates of
Che man who loes to take his pleasure
behind a well broken brace of dogs, a
pair of barrels and straight powder, lit
mauds to reason that that man has
called in all his Ingenuity and all his
knowledge of breeding to proide himPersonal
self with a sporting dog that is best
adapted for the sport that is proided
for him Therefore in some places in
America, where the plains are so ast
a ery fast and wide ranging pointer
Is required— one, too, with "bird sense"
Where true ranging, a good nose and
stanchness on ' game are to be found
embodied in one single dog,' there, per
haps, hae we found the perfect ani
mal, and a retrieing pointer at that
! As in other breeds of dogs, there are
all 'Sizes and sorts of pointers The
short headed, , cloddy ; shouldered and
often weak thlghcd and cow hocked
pointer has gone by the board It
stands to reason that, although the
cart horse can gallop, he cannot gallop
with the thoroughbred, the clean neck
ed,'oblique shouldered, deep hammed,
lie racing machine   Half  a day of
real  going will knock up the | heay
headed, loose throated pointer  He has
had to gie way to the more elegant
quantity; but een such as he should

when It swmed to him that there was
nothing more to come in  the way of

SOCIETY IN IRELAN
A Person Is Judged There Entirely

Where They Were Appreciated
The goernment has with great lib
erality distributed public  documents
from Washington to the remotest parts
of the country In his book on "The
Oerland  Stage to  California" Mr
Franklin Root tells how the oerload
ed mails were sometimes relieed
Before the dally mail went into oper
ation and when a stage went to' Salt
Lake City only once a week some of
the boys on the line used to despise a
coach almost wholly loaded up with
public documents, but such mail mat
ter came quite handy at times 
Occasionally the driers, as they
themseles said,* would get stalled go
ing through a bad slough \ In rough
weather and would be unable to moe
In that case they were obliged to take
oat Back after sack of the "pub docs,"
open the bags  and pile the massie
books from the goernment < printing
office Into the slough and by building
a solid foundation with them were en
abled to pull the coach out of the mire
The Old Jewish Wedding Ring
The old time Jewish wedding ring
was quite a ponderous affair of filigree
gold, enameled in colors A dome or
temple in miniature, which rose from
the middle of the hoop, was a faorite
deice Sometimes the hoop was about
threequarters of an inch wide and had
raised edges
One ring of this kind is described by
an authority as haing fie eleations
on the upper part, the center la hex
agonal tower, with penthouse roof slop
ing down to the hoop, the gables and
sides pierced with , fourteen holes, or
windows, and the roof scored to imi
tate tiles On either side of this was a
smaller tower without windows No
other ring could find room on a wom
