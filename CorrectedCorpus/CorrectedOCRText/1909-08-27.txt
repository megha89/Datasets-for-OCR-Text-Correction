THE PRIMRY ELECTION LW
The primary elecion in San Francisco las week was

he flrspracical os of ho primary elecion law passed by
he las legislaure, according o he proisions of which
all fuure pary nominaions in California, wheher for
sae, couny or municipal officers, mus be held I seems
o hae worked saisfacory Less han 50 per cen of he
oal oe was polled Tha is a ery fair percenages
much larger han has hereofore been he rule under he

Ono objecion o he new law is he addiional expense

dae, in a cones wihin his own pary will hae o make
wo canasses— one before nominaion, and if successful in

his elecion/ This is a serious handicap, inasmuch ris
he cos of geing eleced o office has always been far oo
grea, leading o increased, salaries of officials, and a con
sequen addiional ax; upon he people for he suppor of
his exraagance, Primary ballos— and hey are formid

prined and circulaed a he expense of he, public, and he
elecion mus be conduced in eery respec he same, as

be almos? as heay a a primary elecion as a a general
eiecion I is his aspec of he law ha presens he
mos objecionable feaure, coupled wih he preailing
idea ha no paricular reform in poliics" is likely o be
effeced by he sysem I is premaie a presen o, pass

How He Found
Sleep
SLLIE MENEEM
[Copyrigh, 1909, by mcrjcan Pres sso
ciaion]
The wny 1 go ou of he burglar lino
was hisPersonal I hnd mighy good nere nnd
wasn' nfrald of nny one I deemed o
know wha kind of a crib lo crack nnd
how o do i wihou waking anybody
up and geing awny beween midnigh
and dawn, when he cops nre mos
drowsy While 1 was doing n job 1
hough of nohirig' excep ny work
and wns boh cool and wachful I
wasn' one of hose blokes who scare
people o deah or who arc ready If
necessary o add murder o robbery
The ruh 13 I neer liked he prospec
of facing eiher charge
s I was saying, while engaged a
my work, howeer dangerous, I was
seady' as a monumen, bu wben dan
ger hnd passed and I had nohing o do
bu hink 1 wen downhill ery fas
Wha bohered me mos was ha 1
couldn' sleep nlghsha Is when
comforably sowed away In bed I
once ook a nap in a genleman's par
lor and was only wakened by he sun
coming up and shining in my eyes I
Jus go ou in ime o sae myself
Bu when lying on a sof maress,
wih warm coers and no chance of
being disurbed, sleep wouldn' come
o mo I lay awake hinking of he
ime wben I would hear prison doors
clang behind me The hough was
dreadful I'm afraid I was oo fine
grained for he business
Monh afer monh my hours pi
sleep rcw loss ill I feared insaniy
One nigh I woke up n midnigh afer
bains slep wo hours and Unow here
would be no more slumber for me ill'
he nex ime I wen o bed I was so 1
desperae ha T go up wih he In
enion of going Ino some house where
I hnd no righ and here snach an
oher couple of hours' sleep I had a
crib In iew, a small house wih no
much in I Bu I was looking for
sleep! no plunder 1 wen here, ook
ou a pane of glass, enered and wen
upsairs o find a place o sele down
I sood in n dark hall looking "Ino a
room where r nigh lamp was burning
In he room a woman was In bed wih
a child, boh asleep The child was
sleeping on he fron of he bed ery
near he edge He was a boy and I
hink, abou lire years old
On a narrow lower bed, close beside
he oher, slep anoher child, a girl of
abou hree She was sleeping in he
cener of her bed on her side and had
her chubby fis up agains her fa
cheek I was ho summer weaher,
and none of hem excep he woman
had any coers whaeer
Wha ineresed me was ha he
boy's head was hanging oer he side
of his bed and so much of his body,
oo, ha i looked o me as If he was
abou o fall He was resless, and I
knew be would be oer <ery soon
Somehow I waned o see him fall,
hough I kep in he dark so ha he
wouldn' see me if ho woke up The
nes kick he made sen him oer lie
fell a couple of fee, bu didn' wake
up He landed parlyou he lile girl,
bu she didn' wake up eiher I ex
peced she would, as she moaned once
or wice in her sleep and urned oer,
bu finally she slep as peacefully as
before "
I was such a delighful picure o
one suffering from insomnia ha I
kep on waching he children The
boy coninued his kicking and crowded
he girl, pushing her wih eery moe
o he fron edge of her bed I mus
hae been half an hour ha he kep
his up, when here was n hump, and
he girl lay on he floor Bu she
seenjed o be as comforable here as
on her bed  any rae, she showed
no he leas sign of waking
Meanwhile I heard he muering of
disan hunder, and while I was look
ing a hem all here came one errific
crash loud enough o wake he dead
The moher urned oer, bu neiher
of he children moed Then followed
one crash afer anoher, and I expec
ed ha a leas he moher would
wake up and ake a look a her chil
dren Bu she slep on She mus hae
boon ery ired or had los a lo of
sleep or she couldn' hae slep
hrough hose errible bols Neer
had I heard such hunder before
The only effec he sorm had on any
of hem was o increase he resless
ness of he boy He rolled and um
bled In his sleep like a ship ossed by
he waes, someimes lying for a few
minues close agains his moher's bed
hen rolling owr o he ouer edge of
his own I was sure he'd in ime um
ble ou of his bed, as he had ou of
he oher, nnd I was bound o see him
do I Sure enough, before I expeced
I he gae  lurch and landed plumb
on op of his siser
Neiher of hem awoke
I reckon women know in heir sleep
wha's solnj; en wih heir children,
for, now ha he sorm was oer and
eeryhing was sill as he omb, he
moher sa up in bed glanced a her
children, go up and pu hem In heir
proper places Then she wen back o
brd herself and was asleep in a mo
men
"Well," I said o myself, "if ha's
wha n clear conscience will furnish
I'm going o hae a clear conscience"
1 wen back o my room resoled, ne
W o ener nny man's house again bu
my own, a lean no; for plunder I
