As we hae racers nnd cart horses,
so the Arabs nnd the naties of north
eastern Africa hae breeds of camels
seerally adapted for riding and for
carrying burdens It is to the fast rid
ing and racing camels that the name
dromedary aloue applies, so that this
term— the (Jreek equialent of "racer"
"•—lndicates merely a breed and not n
particular species
All the camels of Arabia and Africa,
as well as those employed In India, be
long to the  single 3 humped species,
which is a lightly built and long limbed
animal In comparison with Its double
bnmped relatie, the Bactrian camel of
central Asia Not improbably some of
the herds of the latter species which
are found In the neighborhood of th»>
Gobi desert are the descendants of
aboriginally wild animals, but the
Arabian camel Is quite unknown In n
Wild state, and we are eeu ignorant
of Its birthplace, although it Is quite
likely that this may hae been north
Africa or the neighborhood of the Ara
blan desert For traersing tleseri
tracts camels are absolutely Indispen
sable Their broad cusuionlike boofs
proclaim them essentially animals 0/

• As if conscious that man cannot do
without them, camels are some of the
worst tempered and ill natured brutes
In creation, and, sae for their en
durance and the heay loads they can
carry, no oue has a good word to say
In their faor If a camel can bite a
mounted traeler whom he niay be
passing in a narrow road, lie will neer
fail to aail himself of the opportunity,

AN INIAN'S TEST
Bott He iscoered That s White
Mall Was a Coward
"The Indian has a queer way of de
termining whether or not a man is
game, Judging from an experience I
had some years ago," said a man who
once made an educational tour of the
west, "and the same little experience
coninced me that the Indian's system
of reasoning along this line is by no
means a bad one
"Stories had been told which brought
about a clash between the Indian and
a white man Tln» two men originally
had nothing against each other The
Indian had a bad reputation— that is,
he had the reputation of being a bad
man, a desperate, dangerous fellow,
who would fight a buzzsaw at the drop
of a hat' The white man who blew
Into the section had in some way
Coined a similar reputation He was
said to be a dangerous character and a
mon who had neer been whipped We
concluded that we would hae some
fun We met the Indian and told him
a long story about bis new rial and
reminded him that his laurels were In
danger and succeeded in getting bin
pride stirred, and his Indian blood was
soon up to the fighting point Soou
after tills we met the white man, and
we filled him up with the same kind
of talk He said he would take care of
the Indian all right In due time, and
in short, would make him take to the
woods Shortly we met the Indian
again and told him the desperate white
man wns after his scalp He smiled
and shook his bead
"A few days later we were talking
to the white man when the Indian
Came tip to Join the group He had
spotted the stranger and knew him by
sight Without saying a word to him
he walked up within arm's reach and
struck the white man In the face with
a rough, heay gloe lie paused for a
few seconds nnd hit him again 'Ughf
he exclaimed as he wheeled around
anil walked away The white man
looked at the Indian In amazement, but
made no show of resentment Later in
the day when we asked the Indian
why It was that he did not follow up
the insult with blows he told us the
white man was a coward In explain
ing how he knew It he said' the man's
"Jaw dropped' when he struck him In
the face the second time with the gloe
and that this, with the Indian, was an
unfailing sign of cowardice"— New Or

How Mussels Moe,
The general Impression Is that mus
sels do not moe They fasten them
seles to certain objects or they lie In
the mud aud sand at the bottom of the
watet, and there they pass their exist*
enee In proof of this the fact Is ad
duced that mussels are at times burled
under the sandy deposit when a rush
of water carries a lot of soil with it A
naturalist who has deoted much time
to the study of these creatures says,
that mussels do moe slowly, and the
moement Is accomplished in the fol
lowing mannerPersonal
The mussel opens Its shell and pro
jects its body to a certain extent from
Its projecting case Then it exerts some
force whereby It keeps the shell aboe
the soil and uses Its body to propel it
self along the bottom Just in the same
way as a land snake gets oer the
ground If the sand is examined after
the mussel has taken one of these
strolls, Jt will be easy to see two paral
lel lines caused by the edges of the
shell touching the ground

thereon and getting a liing from the
sea| others from Incidents that hae
taken place to sailors and fishermen

il's Elbow represent the head fireman

onco inhabited by a thrifty number of
these domestic adjuncts, which ran
wild and lied on the snakes and mice,
which were plentiful Mouse Island
was once Infested by these rodents, as
are most of the other islands They are
a wood species and do uot trouble hu
man habitations Just where they came
from no one knows They are found
on islands far out from the shore
Squirrel island was once the home of
a large colony of gray squirrels which
came down to the seashore eery seen
years from the inland woods Red
squirrels are found on most of the is

for they prefer to nest In unoccupied
cottages
Haddock Island was so named from

Old Man and Old Woman were named
by the fishermen from a supposed re
semblance Harpoon island from this
implement, which was dug out of the
paud there; Killickstouc island because

was once used as a pasture, and the
animals were transferred In scows;
Thief Island from a culprit who was

Beaer island, in John's bay, from
the English manofwar named Bea

Wonderfat Minute Sheila
There is a sand bank at Connemara,
on the west coast of Ireland, that Is the
Mecca of eery curiosity seeker who la
fortunate enough to know of its exist
ence As a general thing sand banks
are not a great attraction, but In this
particular case the attractie power is
not in the sand itself, but in the mil
lions of extinct miniature shells which
are almost as numerous as the grains
of sand with which they are intermin
gled The largest of these little won
ders is smaller than the smallest pin
head and some of them so minute that
they can easily be put through the eye
of a common sewing needle, yet each is
as perfect as the pearly nautilus, the
spider shell, the sea urchin or any other
marine oddity
They are of all shapes and forms Im
aginable One will hae the perfect
outlines of a miniature basket another
will look like a fairy's tobacco box,
while a third needs no effort of the im
agination to gie it the form of a bot
tle The flash shells of Ceylon and Aus
tralia are the only liing ' representa
ties of these conchological wonders
Naturalists who hae examined the
Ceylonese flash shells say that each is
filled with a tiny bit of Jellylike sub
stance, which of course Is the animal
Itself , but which is so infinitesimal that
no distinction can be obsered between
head and heart, mouth and stomach
Eskimo Mythology
Among the Eskimos the sun Personal is a
maiden, and the moon is her brother
who is oercome by a wicked passion
for her Once as this girl was at a
dancing party in a friend's hut some
one came up and took hold of her by
the shoulders and shook her, which is,
according to the legend, the Eskimo
manner of declaring one's loe She
could not tell who it was in the dark,
and so she slipped her hand in some
soot and smeared one of his cheeks
with It  When a light was struck in
the hut, she saw to her dismay that It
was her brother, and without waiting
to learn any more she took to her
heels He started in hot pursuit And
so they ran until they got to the end of
the world, the jumping off place, when
they both Jumped into the sky There
the moon still chases his sister, the
sun, and eery now and then he turns
his sooty cheek to the earth, when he
becomes so dark that you cannot see
him
Raw Eggs
When raw eggs are ordered for an
Inalid to whom they are objectiona
ble, make as palatable as possible by
haing the egg as cold as one can make
it and then sere it from a cold glass as
soon as it is opened Of course it is
useless to sere any sae perfectly
fresh eggs
If the white alone is to be taken, it
should be beaten with a whisk until
ery stiff and frothy, then seasoned
with salt or sugar, whicheer is prefer
red, and eaten with a spoon
Some who object to an egg beaten in
a glass of milk, sweetened and flaored,
can take the egg if the sugar is omit
ted and the flaoring extract replaced
by brandy— What to Eat
Women and Money
If you would hae your women folk
economical, let them handle money
and learn to respect Its alue There
may be women who hae not sufficient
womanliness to honor the confidence
this trust implies, but they are excep
tions If such be your daughters, It is
your business to teach them otherwise
If they be your wies, it Is your own
fault for haing married them When
a father gies his son an allowance, he
should do the same for his daughter,
not as a matter of material faor, for
the daughter's bills might double the
son's allowance, but as a matter of
discipline, of financial experience and
education— Collier's
The Story of Bishop Hatto
Bishop Hatto was a wicked prelate
who lied in 970 on the banks of the
Rhine, where he owned a tower, which
Is at the present day pointed out to
traelers as the Mouse tower Here are
stored large quantities of grain A fam
ine ensued, and the bishop Inited the
people to his granaries As soon as they
were there he set fire to the building
and burned up the people The next
morning the souls of the dead appeared
as an army of rats and not only de
stroyed eerything belonging to the
bishop, but finished by making a meal

| Home seekers are pouring into
the state at the rate of seeral
thousands per week Many of them
will find permanent homes in Cali
fornia Almost eery portion of
the state is receiing benefit from
this inflow of population, commen
surate" with the efforts put forth to
attract, the emigrants Amador
county, it must be admitted, is doing
absolutely nothing toward directing
a portion of this human tide hither
ward Why are her people asleep,
when others are so wideawake on
the subject, and are reaping a sub
stantial reward  for their, trouble?
•The popular idea on the j outside is
that a mining section is necessarily
barren of other resources, and an
undesirable place in which to make
a permauent home As a matter of
fact, there is no fairer, healthier, or
richer portion of the golden state
than the foothills of Amador county
Nature has been prodigal of her
gifts, een entirely independent of
the treasures she has stored up in
the shape of goldbearing deposits
Not only is "eery prospect pleas
ing," but the capabilities of soil and
climate, the latent resources in
horticulture are scarcely sur
passed by any other region in
California, and yet they are lying
neglected— neglected for want of
adertising While other counties
are adding to their population,
Amador, if not actually backsliding,
is doing no more than holding her
own The truth is, we hae depend
ed too much on gold mining Nature
has been so laish in this matter
that we hae lost sight of the many
other adantages we possess We
want systematic organized effort
This has built up other portions of
the state haing far less natural at
tractions than ours It is reported
that oer 100,000 homeseekers pass
through Los  Angeles per year
Many of them settle in southern Cal
ifornia One of the main reasons
for this is that the people of this
part of the state are eer on the
alert to attract the emigrant
They know that population means
wealth The latter is the ineitable
accompaniment of the former in a
new and undeeloped county Ama
dor county ought to be dotted with
small farms and orchards Almost
eery ariety of semitropical fruits
thrie here Land is reasonable in
price Water for irrigation is
abundant in most sections It is
true, we lack rapid transportation
facilities Our great drawback is
the absence of railroad connection
with the heart of the county With
this dissideratrem supplied, Amador
would "blossom as the rose"
THE PANAMA CANAL
The Panama canal, the building of
which has been undertaken by the
United States, is by far the greatest
feat of the kind eer entered upon
in the history of the world To con
nect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans
by a waterway sufficient for the
passage of ships has been the dream
of statesmen for hundreds of years
Many sureys hae been made
through the tropical jungles that
coer this narrow strip of territory
The engineering obstacles to be oer
come were so formidable that thirty
distinct sureys were made After
many years of comparing notes, and
measuring the feasibility of the ari
ous schemes, the Panama route was
deemed the easiest and most practi
cable A French company, using
the name of e Lesseps — the master
engineer who cut the Suez canal
entered upon the work, and spent
hundreds of millions, most of it
squandered in bribery and extraa
gance, fina'ly became insolent,
and abandoned the enterprise It
actually excaated ten miles of the
waterway This, howeer, was the
easiest part of the work, as it tra
ersed a flat swampy country that
presented no serious difficulty other
than the feer which seemed to lurk
amid their fastnesses, and eat up
human lies faster than war The
Suez canal is 88 miles long; nearly
double the length of the proposed
Panama canal, which will not be
oer 50 miles in length The Suez
canal, howeer, was a baby enter
prise in comparison with the might
ier work of diiding the two Amer
icas; For ,a distance of ten miles
the Panama cut will be three hun
dred feet deep • At another point a
dam twenty miles loug and two hun
dred feet high will be built to secure
the canal from danger by the flood
waters of the Chagres rier All
reseroirs heretofore constructed by
man pale into littleness beside this
giant restraining wall To explain
the necessity ,of a reseroir of sucli
proportions — equal in fact to an ar
tificial inland sea — we may staV*
that the annual rainfall in this reg
ion is estimated at 300 inches— a
deluge of water sufficient to coer
the land— barring 'eaporation —to
an aerage depth of 25 feet
The portion already dredged by
the defunct company represents, on
a liberal calculation, not more than
onefifth of the whole/ Two hundred
million dollars were expended by
that company The United States
agrees to purchase the French com
pany's rights 'for the sum of $40,
000,000'" To secure the priilege or
franchise from the Columbian go
ernment will cost ten millions more*
The expense of the excaation still
tobe made is estimated at three
hundred million dollars Ten thous
and men will be kept busy for ten
years to push this gigantic scheme
to a finish  It is not expected, thatj
when completed, the tolls receied
from shipping will pay anything like
interest on the inestment  The
benefits that will accrue from a com
mercial and stratgetic point of iew
will be incalculable  It is meet that
an undertaking of such maguitude
that dwarfs eery other enterprise
conceied by the human mind
should be pushed to a successful
issue by the United States, whose
interests are more itally identified
with the works than all other na
tions combined
' In Madera county the records of
the board of superisors for the last
meeting show 86 different claims al
lowed in faor of as many different
indiiduals against the arious road
funds of that county, the ' total
amount of the claims being in the
neighborhood of $2000 In Amador
county for the same month, the
claims against the road and bridge
funds aggregated 14518, and all but
four bills were drawn in faor of the
fie superisors The four inde
pendent bills represented about $130
In Tuolumne county at the same
monthly meeting the road claims
foot up about $1000, with 26 different
claimants, none of them it may be
stated being superisors In Cala
eras county the road bills aggre
gated something  like $5000, and
there were 65 claimants entered
upon the minutes of the board to
represent the total amount; Of this
sum $768 was drawn by the super
isors So it appears from this that
our sister county is going back on
the pernicious example set by the
superisors of Amador county in
this respect There is not another
county in the state that can com
pare with Amador in this matter
It is a icious system, unauthorized
by law, and it is high time some tax
payer protested these bills presented
by superisors, and thereby rele
gated the question to the courts for
determination
A Bohoolmarm's Trialt
The Sacramento Bee of the 11th con
tains the followingPersonal
Amy B Pharis, a 6chool teacher at
Sutter Creek, Amador county, has
complained to state superintendent of
schools T J Kirk that her salary has
been withheld by the refusal of two of
the three' trustees of the district to
sign her salary warrants In her com
plaint the school teacher states that in
ecember last a woman teacher isited
the district and that the newcomer had
quite a few intimate friends there,
among them being two of the trustees
After awhile, alleges the complaint,
the trustees tried to gie her place to
the new teacher and began to make it
as unpleasant jas they could for the
present teacher,  thinking she would
resign She would not resign, and was
adised by county superintendent' G
Gordon to stand her ground The
complainant states there are two fac
tions in the district If one part of the
district likes the teacher the others do
all they can to make it disagreeable
for her, and jealousy reigns supreme,
is the plaint of teacher Amy B Pharis
State Superintendent Kirk has refer
red the matter to county superintend
ent Gordon for inestigation
Miss Pharis' home is in Sutter Creek
She has taught school for the past
term, except the first six weeks thereof,
at New York Ranch, and it is in that
district that the troubles aboe re
ferred to occurred It seems that she
was at first engaged for two weeks on
probation At the expiration of that
time, her work proing satisfactory,
she was engaged for the term She
taught for the remainder of the term,
in the face of many difficulties, and re
ceied the salary warrants from the
district clerk, but failed to get the same
signed by* one of the other trustees,
and hence her salary has been unpaid
for seeral months  On account of this
she has appealed to the state superin
tendent for rodress, the law proiding
that in case of failure of the district
authorities to issue the orders for sal
ary, the county superintendent may
draw the requisitions upon the treas
ury, with the approal and at the re
quest of the state superintendent It
is, we presume, with this end in iew

A STARTLING PROCLAMATION
The following notice, printed on

Italian and Austrian) was posted in
arious places in Jackson yesterday
The word "Scab" is gien promi
nence by being in larger type, and
in "red" inkPersonal
ATTENTION NONUNION MEN
Notice is hereby gien by Jackson
Miners' Union No 115, Western Fed
eration of Miners, to all men who are
working in or about the mines ami mills
of Jackson mining district, who hae
not got a card in good standing in some
local union of the Western Federation,
on or before the 26th day of June, 15)03,
will lie declared
1  " SOA US "" ' ' '"'
and published and treated as such By
order of the Union
• W  Ould, President
H Gobich, Secretary
Oerlooking its faulty language,
the most charitable construction
we can put upon the posting of such
a notice is that those responsible
therefor do not fully realize the
spirit and import of their action In
its farreaching consequence this
notice transcends in importance the
late strike, as a fullfledged hurri
cane outranks the gentle zephyr
We will not at this time comment
upon it as the sober, wellconsidered
act of an intelligent body of organ
ized laborers We beliee there are
many wellmeaning and intelligent
men connected with the Jackson
Miners' Union Surely, their, sense
of right' will assert itself when they
gie themseles time to ponder oer
the meaning of this outrage upon
the liberty and independence of their
fellow citizens Neer during the
dark days of persecution, born of
religious fanaticism, was a more
intolerant and despotic measure con
cocted to stamp out that' noblest
trait of human character — the exer
cise of one's personal freedom to
earn a liing as his own conscience
shall dictate, subject only to regu
lation by the laws of his country
Has it come to pass that the edicts
of labor uuions are stronger to
thwart than the goernment of the
United States is to protect the indi
idual citizen in the enjoyment of
this fundamental right We hae
neer before heard — not een in the
extremity of a struggle between the
forces of labor and capital, much
less during a period of amity, be
tween these two factors of humau
progress— of a step so radical and
impolitic as the public posliug of a
proclamation of the aboe character
If persisted in, it simply demands
an appeal to the courts for' an in
junction to preent this threatened
inasion of a citizen's rights We
trust, upon mature thought, the
union will reconsider this action,
and withdraw the offensie notice
Its publication is libelous No good
can come of it; much harm may re
sult from persistence i such a
course Think of the sweeping
nature of the notice een from a
union standpoint Identification
with any other labor organization
than the Western Federation will
not count A man must join that
particular brand of unionism, other
wise his allegiance to the cause of
organized labor will not aail

The Standard Electric Company is

the coming season About 25 men left
Jackson Tuesday morning, intending
to take the direct route oer the moan

to Ham's station, about 35 miles from
Jackson From that point they ex
pect to foot it for the remainder of the
trip, about 50 miles The snow has
disappeared as far as a few miles aboe
Hams Each man will hae to pack
proisions and blankets with him The
men are to get from $250 to $3 per day,
pay to commence when they reach
their destination and commence to
work The first work will be to clear
the road from Gardenille to Blue
lakes, so that supplies and material
can be hauled in from the Carson side
Actie operations on the dam itself
will commence early next month It is
expected to complete the Blue lakes
dam this, season ' The trip of these
men going in at this early season, is a
difficult and hazardous one There
has been a ery heay snowfall The

A Nuisance That Should Be Abated
Main street of Japkson seems to be a
rendeous for dogs that are continually
disturbing the peace of citizens whose
business calls them on the street
Wheneer a strange canine comes
through town then the racket begins
Big dogs, little dogs, short tail dogs,
and long tail dogs all join forces and
set up a howl beyond endurance The
nuisance is daily aggraated by some
reckless boy who, "for the fun of the
thing," helps matters along by adding
words of encouragement to' the howl
ing brutes Quite a number of the
dogs hae owners, while others are of
the "hobo" fraternity, but they all need
calling down It is true the people of
Jackson hae become somewhat accus
tomed to the Indian illage style of af
fairs, but what an impression it must
make on a stranger in our midst ogs
can't be blamed for the state of affairs,
neither can boys They like fun and
excitement, but it is somebody's busi
ness to suppress it, and the Ledger in
tends to do its share in that direction
Jackson School Census
The returns of the census marshals
of the respectie districts hae ail been
forwarded to the school superintendent,
Geo A Gordon, but hae not yet been

It will take a couple of weeks yet before

publication The returns, unofficial, for
Jackson district show 450 census chil
dren between 5 and 17, against 448 for
last year— a gain of two The total
number of children of all ages up to 17
is 619, against 634 for 1902— a loss of 15
These figures are subject to correction
by the school superintendent

A man named Giuseppe Malinelli,
commonly known as Jos Campi, who

across the foot bridge crossing the
gulch to his residence, with a heay
load, when he missed his footing, and
fell, fracturing his left leg just aboe
the ankle The fracture is a bad one,
the bone protruding through the skin
The unfortunate ictim is 70 years of
age, and this fact adds to the serious
ness of the case Malinelli was brought
to the hospital Saturday r Gall is
doing his utmost to sae the limb, and
so far the patient is doing as well as
could be expected

feet from the surface There is a
strong ein, oer six feet thick, and
assays from the entire ledge show a
alue of between $5 and $6 per ton
The Cranmer brothers will go to work

pect coutinup tp be faorable The
mine is situated about a quarter of a
mile in the rear of the Pine Groe
hotel property

Accidents Will Happen
Last Sunday week a party of Jack
son's young people went out to the
Tabeau reseroir for an outing The
day was well spent, but the pleasure of
the return trip was somewhat marred,
that is so far as one couple was con
cerned, by an accident which caused
them untold anguish and humiliation
It was the breaking of the front axle
of a buggy which was occupied by a
prominent young business man of Jack
son and a young lady, whose sweet
oice can be hoard any day in any part
of Amador county The trouble began
about one mile this side of the reser
oir, and at the "parting of the ways"
Miss — her forefathers were presi
dents—was thrown to the ground and
receied a good shake up but happily
escaped injury The drier managed
to hold on to the lines and was dragged
by the horse seeral yards before the
animal could be brought to a standstill
He was somewhat bruised, but likewise
escaped injury The screams of the
young lady in question brought the
carriage immediately in front of them
to a standstill After ascertaing the
cause of the alarm, the "cause" was
taken in and coneyed to Jackson,
while the cattle dealer, as such being a
good rider, mounted his buggy horse
and made his lonely way to the city

Religious Notes
Re Geo Beatty of San Francisco,
who is engaged in Sunday school work
in connection with the M E church,
deliered a few lectures in Amador
county during the past week Last
Monday night he lectured at the M

was interesting and displayed the true
ability of Mr Beatty as a forcible
speaker

A Bright Start In Life
r G M Freeman jr, a recent

for the city r Freeman is an ex
ceptionally bright young man His
college class was composed of fortysix
students, and be stood first in the
graduation class, which is certainly a
record to be proud of r Freeman sr,
the father of the young man, formerly
practiced medicine in lone and Sutter
Creek,  and his many friends in the
county will be pleased to hear of his
son's substantial start in life
Rural eliery
The postmaster of Jackson has re
ceied from the authorities at Wash
ington a request for maps of Amador
county, showing roads, dwellings, and
other information concerning the coun
ty The information is sought with a
iew to the introduction of the rural
deliery system in this county, if deem
ed adisable after a full inestigation
No map of Amador county has been
published since 1881, so that a com
plete map, showing the data required
up to the present date, Is not procur
able It is thought that a set of plats,
like those made for the insurance busi
ness, showing the lots and residences
in each town, would answer the
purpose

FROM CORRESPONENTS
Letters From Volcano, Pine Groe,
Plymouth and Amador City
Volcano, Cal, May 12, 1903
In the last week's issue of the Ledger
was chronicled the sad and sudden
death of r Albert N Robert of this
place, and a tribute paid to his sterling
worth; but it is here where he was
best known that his death brings sad
ness to the many hearts It has been
his mission to do much good, and his
patients became his faithful friends
The sorrowing faces about his bier told
more Impressiely than words how
uniersally he was beloed 
The room where the casket was
placed was filled with beautiful frag
rant flowers— a pillow in white carna
tions and ferns, bearing the words
"Our brother," from the Masonic
fraternity, which order conducted the
funeral serices according to their
beautiful and impressie ritual A
selected choir from Pine Groe and
Volcano sang a number of appropriate
hymns The brothers of the mystic
tie then consigned the remains of their
wellbeloed brother to the grae,
made beautiful by loing hands r
Robert's place in our midst cannot be
filled, and we griee in submitting the
decree of an unerring God
Rest, rest— His sleeping alter pain;
When lights are down and curtains close, we
sleep;
The stars watch on, their pale rays faintly
beep
Their unseen igil o'er the slumbering one
Not death— but rest— the music of the spheres
The angels' lullaby of sweet repose
We should not weep^'ils wellQod knows
And it is sweet to sleep
Such strenuous liing 1 How the pulses throb!
Life's little triumphs— joys— its cares and
pain;
The wondrous workings of the busy brain
Till It is time to rest— He calls us home
Think not of death, but rest
More peaceful and profound, that does not
dream
In halfunconscious pain' It should not seem
That dreadful parting— surely He knows best
'Tls hard to say "goodby," but not "good
night" 1
We all must sometimes sleep at close of day
And if the weary one can only pray
With soul unstained— 'tis well;
"He gieth His beloed sleep," why weep?
The wayward, weary, sinstained soul needs
rest
Rest, rest, Indeed, like those their works op
 pressed
For them the angels weep— we all need sleep
Not death, but God's own rest I
Volcano, Cal, May 13

Goernment Aid to Fanners
How many people of this county hae
isited the Agricultural Experimental
Station located about four miles aboe
Jackson? This is truly an Interesting
place, and no one interested in fruit
culture should fail to isit this beauti
ful place and learn what can be pro
duced in the way of fruits without Irri
gation The station has been in exist
ence for fourteen years, under the
superision of the state uniersity, as
sisted by federal appropriations
When this location was selected by
the goernment it was for the purpose
of ascertaining the worth of the soil
peculiar to the foothills for agri
cultural uses It is needless to say that
the experiment has been a success The
fact has been demonstrated beyond a
doubt Through the courtesy of J H
Barber, who has charge of the station,
the Ledger has become acquainted
with the many details of the work At
the present time thirty acres are under
a state of high cultiation, and the
crops produced are marelous It
must be understood that the land now
in use Is what is known as "hill tops,"
part of which is red clay soil, inter
mixed with granite, and was formerly
coered with chaparal and pine trees,
the same as can be found anywhere in
this locality Eery kind of fruit tree
and grape imaginable are grown, and
show health and productieness, and
the whole secret lies in cultiation,
which example should be followed by
all who wish to gain a good lielihood
by raising fruit We will print from
time to time statements and statistics
to be furnished by Mr Barber for the
benefit of our readers, and if they profit
thereby, farming can be made a suc

~~ SENATE ETIQUETTE
It Came Near Slaking Rooseelt Hiss
McKlnley's Inauguration
• A ice president seated ln solitary
grandeur ln the senate chamber, while
the ceremony of a presidential inaugu
ration to which be has been inited as
an honored guest ls going qn outside,
surely presents a spectacle with an ele
ment of humor ln It Few persons
know how near Theodore Rooseelt
came to playing such a part on the 4th
of March, 1001 The senate stickles
fo for minor details of etiquette that
the most strenuous reformer, would
hardly enture to transgress its rules,
and they require that a formal motion
to adjourn shall be put before a day's
session can come to an end After hia
inauguration as ice president in the
senate chamber Mr Rooseelt took the
gael and, when the routine business
wns finished, directed the sergeant at
anna, as usual, to proceed with the
ceremony of inaugurating Mr McKin
ley as president
It was then ln order for some senator
to moe an adjournment, but in the
confusion nobody seemed to hae his
wits about him, and the whole assem
blage, including tho senators, quitted
the chamber for tho east portico, where
the oath wns to bo administered and
the address deliered In a few min
utes the ice president found himself
alone, with a fair prospect of remain
Ing so until the day's performances
were oer, but It chanced that Senator
Heltfeld missed his bat while passing
through the corridor and came back to
look for It Face to face with tho ice
president it occursed to the senator
that something must be wrong, so with
the utmost graity be 'moed "that
the senate do now adjourn" Mr
Rooseelt with equal solemnity, put
the motion, declared it carried and
proceeded ln Mr Heltfeld's company
to tbe place on the presidential stand
which had been resered for him—

Shadow 'Superstitions",
Our proerb, "eil catch the hind
most" is based on one of the curious
shadow legends According to the fa
ble, the deil had a regular school at
Toledo, Spain Commencement was
Inaugurated by the graduating class
running through a long subterranean
hall Tbe deil hid at a place known
only to himself, and If be "caught the
hindmost" he eer after claimed him or
her as his special property Sometimes
he only caught the shadow, and the
persons thus depried of their "second
self" were supposed to make the best
astrologers and magicians
Nearly all East Indian tribes as well
as the Malayans and seeral African
sects beliee that if a man walks
along tbe south bank of a rier casting
his shadow ' across the water a croco
dile will seize It and thus draw the
owner to certain death
Seeral writers, Flske among the
rest, say that the Zulus hae a supersti
tion similar to that of the old Baby
louinM — iz, that a dead body has no
shadow The Modocs and the Kla
maths of Oregon formerly refused to
hae their pictures taken for fear that
the process would take away their
shadows In the Aryan folk tale the
"wltchdalo," or "Infernal Sabbath,"
was celebrated only' by witches' shad^

Hitch Your Wagron to a Star
A student of the horse thus explains
where Emerson's epigram, "Hitch your
wagon to a star," originatedPersonal Long be
fore tbe war there was a famous trot
ting stallion of the name of American
Star, belonging to one Beely Ameri
can Star mares became scattered all
through New England and New York,
for they were the best roadsters in the
country, and eery farmer must hae
one It soon became well understood
that in order not to lose the respect of
the community one must drie nothing
else Later It became a subject of ban
ter If one farmer passed another on
the road, he would look oer his shoul
der and shout, "Why don't you hitch
your wagon to a star?" Unquestion
ably Emerson many a time had heaid
the remark, and ln his lecture on
"American Ciilization" at the Smith
sonian Institution ln ISO 2he rung it
ln for the first time, adising mankind
ln general to aim high and "Hitch your
wagon to a star," thus conerting a

THE FIRST TAILOR
HE MONOPOLIZE THE SARTORIAL
TRAE OF THE WORL
Ills Method! Were Crude, and Hla
Materials Were Uathcr Grotesque,
but He Turned Out Good, Honest
'Work, Hand Stltcned Throughout
The first industry of the world was
tailoring The first maker of clothes
mil the first wearer was Adam Of
tills strange character who appears on
the pages of history ln the dual role of
the first tailor and the first customer
we hae but a brief biography TJio
meager details require sympathetic in
terpretation to make up a complete
story Of his father and mother no
mention ls made, but the record shows
he was destined to be a clothier of
some Bort, for be was put Into Eden to
"dress" the garden We do not know
If he obeyed this command, as his
 biographers do not so state, for, it
seems, Instead of "dressing the gar
den he "dressed" himself
His early marriage and the trouble
relating to tbe theft of some fruit with
sundry other unpleasant details pre
ceded his work as a tailor He began
in a humble way; just himself ana
one assistant He was one of the early
settlers ln a newly opened country, a
land of natural adantages which must
soon attract other inhabitants With
a large and Increasing population fie
foresaw that there must come a grow
ing demand for clothing If he could in
troduce them and make popular his
new inention He was a pioneer He
had no competition He controlled the
tailoring trade of the world Thus
with the first industry came the first
trust
As he busily piled his needle we
know not what isions of future busi
ness and wealth filled his ambitious
mind But neer ln his wildest dreama
did he conceie that his little tailoring
establishment, employing only four
hands, doing only a local trade and
turning out the first custom made gar
ment would be the beginning of a
ready made clothing business that ln
the United States alone gies labor to
hundreds of thousands of hands and
coers an Inestment of a great many
million dollars
But of the' great wealth that has
come from his Inention Adam, like
most pioneers, made no money what
eer and died leaing his family with
out a penny Een his name is not as
sociated with his wonderful discoery,
but— such is the sarcasm of time— lt ap
pears only ln the word Adam's apple,
in memory not of his irtues, but of aa
escapade of his wife
 Though een Carlyle has not recog
nized j Adam's sartorial genius, there
are some capital points in the work of
this first tailor
He originated the style himself Ho
was not a, petty trader on the reputa
tion of others and Imitating their fash
ions Een in the names for the gar
ments he was original The first suit
of clothes, In reality only a girdle or
belt, lie humorously termed an "apron"
It ls difficult to determine the season
of tho year Judging from the coolness
of tho suit It might hae been a sum
mer style, but as It was Jnst a little
after the fall it was probably early ln
the winter
Tlioy were hand stitched throughout
Tboy contained no machine work or
cheap labor The workshop was in the
open air and, although tailored in the
sweat of his brow, no sweatshop work
wns possible
The material was not of the best but
Adam found no better at band Some
of the modern tailors, making shoddy
garments at shoddy prices, imitate
Adam, who used "leaings"
As to Adam, the first customer, when
he was alone ln the world he neer
thought of dress, but when he came to
the realization of himself as an indi
idual and in relation to others be be
gan to spruce up Courtship led him
to beautify himself, to appear well in
tho eyes of "the only woman he eer
loed" Human nature has not changed
much
With the entry of society dress be
gan Perhaps this ls why dress forms
so prominent a feature ln society to
day
After eating the apple of knowledge
the mind of Adam was suddenly Illu
minated as If by a thousand electric
lights A great thought of large, prac
tical, worldly wisdom flashed before
him He realized that to amount to
anything ln the world he must make a
good appearance In this he struck a
keynote of business success
Surely he needed to keep up appear
ances He reflected oer his actions
for the two weeks prior and then
looked at his future He had been in
bad society and had been seen with a
disreputable serpent he had been led
into temptation, he had broken the law,
he was implicated in an apple theft as
accessory after the fact be 'bad some
of the stolen goods in his possession
and he was a fugitie from justice, for
he was then In "hiding" iscoery
was certain He was to bi eicted
from his home and in disgrace had to
face the awfulness of actually earning
his" own liing by work Then, after a
mild attack of remorse, be was equal
to the situation and in a manly way ac
cepted it, made himself a suit of clothes
ln which he could make a decent ap
pearance and began life anew with the
courage, hope, pride and confidence that
comes from the consciousness of being
well dressed— William George Jordan

A Oath at Ttflls
To take a bath at Tiflis ls to court
a wonderful experience Abundant
springs of water, strongly Impregnated
with sulphureted hydrogen, supply the
building and in its aulted chambers,
far Itelow the street, there is no sound
but the splash of the fountain and the
rolling echo of one's own oice Henry
Norman gies a description of the
masseur who presides oer the bath
and makes its most eccentric feature
"He is a Persian, who speaks but a
word or two of Russian His head is
shaed, a rag is twisted round • his
waist, and his feet are dyed orange
"First he rubs you, and then sudden
ly, as you He face downward on the
marble slab, he is upon your back, his
feet dug into your spine, his hands
grasping your shoulders, to increase
tho pressure Slowly, with skillful ap
preciation of eery muscle, his feet
grind up and down your back • They
encircle your neck They are on your
head
"Then he aults lightly off, and in a
moment from a linen bag filled with
soap he has squeezed clouds of per
fumed bubbles, and you are hidden in
them from head to foot as completely
as If you had fallen Into a snowdrift
You are not absolutely bruised, but
you are clean" 
Snertneia That Neer Falls
uring a sleepless night , the Vizier
ftiujjeduddln Kumlja dispatched his
slae, Bcdruddln EJas, to bring him
sweets The slae procured a copper
kettle heaped with many kinds of
fruits and sweets, and Mujjeduddln be
gan to eat  (
"You relish them, my master?" asked
the slae
The izier shrugged his shoulders
"These fruits are sweet— for the mo
ment," he said, "but show me a fruit
the sweetness of which will endure
een unto the judgment day"
"Such fruits there are, my master,"
cried the slae" and hastened toward
the Meschcd Husa, where he awoke
the staring orphans ln the house of
Allwin and led them forth and into the
room of his master Oerjoyed, the
famished children deoured the fruits
"Look, oh, my master," said the
slae Here you see fruits the sweet
ness of which endures unto the Judg

sents to his betrothed a prayer book
and many other gifts, which usually In
clude a goose She ln turn gies him,
especially ln Sweden, a shirt, and this
he Inariably wears on his wedding
day Afterward he puts it away, and
under no circumstances will he wear
It again while alie But he wears It
tn his grae, and there are Swedes
who earnestly beliee not only ln the
resurrection of the body, but to the
eritable resurrection of the betrothal
shirts of such husbands as hae neer
broken any of their marriage ows
Tbe Swedish widower must destroy on
the ee of his second marriage the
bridal shirt which his first wife gae
him
To 801 l Water Without a Kettle
"My wife and I,", says a traeling
man, "were once ln a hotel where we
couldn't get any boiling water After
we had discussed the situation my
wife asked me if I had an enelope In
my satchel I got one out when she
told me to fill It with wafer and hold
It oer the gas jet I hesitated, but
finally did it and expected to see the
enelope blaze up eery minute But
it didn't blaze The enelope took on a
little soot but that was all The water
boiled ln time, and tbe enelope was as
good as eer when the experiment was
at an end I don't know the chemistry
of the process, but try it yourself and
see if It will not work"
The Oriental Amethyst
The oriental amethyst is really a io
let colored sapphire, which ls an ex
ceedingly rare gem and of brilliant lus
ter It is regarded as a sacred stone,
and It ls used to ornament the cross
and the pastoral ring of Catholic bish
ops The ancients often used the ame
thyst for cutting figures both in relief
and in Intaglio, and there is ln the na
tional library of France a delicately
wrought profile of Maecenas, a Roman
statesman of Octaius' time, engraed
on amethyst by ioscorides, one of the
four celebrated engraers mentioned
by Pliny

"Some people," said the caller with
it slight sneer, "seem to think that

AT A HORSE AUCTION
The Proceedings aa Viewed Fiy>m
tbe Horse's Standpoint
Skipper' wns a police horse and tbe
pride of the mounted squad until he
acquired a Spain Then he was sent
to a sales stable His experience*
there as told by Sewell Ford |in
"Horses Nine" were as followsPersonal
Skipper was led into a big ring be
fore a lot of men A man on a box
shouted out a number and  began to
tulk ery fast Skipper gathered that
he was talking about him Skipper
learned that he was still only six years
old and that he had been owned as a
saddle horse by a lady who was about
to sail for Europe and was closing out
her stable This was news to Skipper
 The man talked ery nicely about
Skipper He said he was kind, gentle,
sound ln wind and limb and was not
only trained to the saddle, but would
work either single or double The man
wanted to know how much the gentle
men were willing to pay for a' bay
gelding of this description
Some one on the outer edge of the
crowd said, "Ten dollars"
At this the man on the box grew
quite indignant He asked if the other
man wouldn't like a siler mounted
harness and a lap robe thrown in
"Fifteen," said another man
 Somebody else said "Twenty," an
other man said "Twentyfle," and still
another "Thirty" Then there was a
hitch The man on the box began to
talk ery fast Indeed
"Thutty, thutty, thutty, thutty! o
I hear the fie? Thutty, thutty, thut
ty, thutty Will you make it fie?"
"Thirtyfie," said a red faced man
who had pushed his way to the front
and was looking Skipper oer sharply
The man on the box said "Thutty
fle!" a good many times and asked if
he "heard forty" Eidently he did
not, for he stopped and said ery slow
ly and distinctly,' looking expectantly
aroundPersonal "Are you all done? Thirty
fie—once; thirtyfie— twice; third—
and last call — sold for $351"
• When Skipper heard this, he hung
his bead When you hae been a $250
blue rlbboner and the pride " of the
force, it Is sad to be "knocked down"
for $35
INSTINCT IS THE TEACHER
How the Young of the Feathered
Tribe Are Educated
There ls a school of the woods, just
as much as there is a church of the
woods or a parliament of the Personal woods
or a Society of United Charities of tho
woods, and no more There is nothing
In the dealing of animals with their,
young that ln the remotest way sug
gests human instruction and discipline
The young of all the wild creatures do
Instinctiely what their parents do and
did They do not hae to be taught;
they are taught from the jump, says a
writer in the Atlantic Monthly' Tho
bird sings at the proper age and builds
Its nest and takes its appropriate food
without any hint at all from  its par
ents Tbe young ducks, take to tho
water when hatched by a duck and
die and stalk insects and wash them
seles just as their mothers did Young
chickens and young turkeys under
stand the arious calls and signals of
their mother the first time they hear or
see them At the first alarm note they
squat; at a call to food they come on
the first day as on the tenth The hab
its of cleanliness of tbe nestlings are
established from the first hour of their
lies When a bird comes to build its
first nest and to rear its first brood, It
knows how to proceed as well as It
does years later or as Its parents did
before it The fox is afraid of a trap
before he has had any experience with
it and the hare thumps upon the
ground at Bight of anything strange
and unusual, whether its mates be
within hearing or not No bird teaches
its young to fly They fly Instinctiely,
when their wings are strong enough
ifference In Prayers
Little Alice always said her prayers
regularly before going to bed One
night howeer, as she rested her head
on the pillow she remarked, ln a ques
tioning wayPersonal
"Mamma, my prayers are so much
longer than the one nurse says in the
morning Can't I say hers when I'm
tired?""
"oes the nurse pray in the morn
ing?' asked the mother with a puzzled
look
"Yes," said Alice sweetly "She says,
