Why Leaes Turn Broirn
The greeu matter in the tissues of a
leaf is composed of two colors, red and
blue When the sap ceases to flow in
tbe autumn the natural growth of the
tree Is retarded, and oxidatiou of the
tissues takes place Under certain con
ditions the green of the leaf changes to
rod Under different aspects it takes
oil a yellow or brown hue The differ
ence in color is due to the difference in
combinations of the original constitu
ents of the green tissues and to the
arying condition of climate, exposure
and soil Maples aud oaks hae the

MRRIGE IN MEXICO
Bow tbe Gngiigemnit and Wedding
r Celebrated
The Mexican people are hospitable to
a fault, always welcoming their friends
een though they hae not enough to
at themseles nd they religiously
isit the sick, including those who
hae contagious diseases They are nl
so addicted to public social functions,
the inariable mode of entertainment
being the dnnce They are fond of mu
sic, though not proficient in the art of
making it, probably more from lack of
opportunity than from lack' of capac
ity' The iolin and guitar are the usual
instruments of music, the repertory of
the local musicians being usually lim
ited to a few tunes which are in equal
demand for the dance and for the fu
neral
One of the most interesting and beau
tiful of the social functions is the pren
dorio' When a young man wishes to
rru^y he asks for the girl of his choice
of the parents, not of the girl herself,
and if she is gien the prendorio at
once follows, ushered in by shooting
nnd, demousf rations of joy The bride
and bridegroom are publicly presented
to their future parentsinlaw, after
whjch the company pass in procession
In front of the couple, each one drop
plug a piece of money into the hands
of the bride Then follows the ineita
ble dance This public betrothal is con
sidered almost as binding as marriage,
and I hae heard of but one instance
In which the compact was not kept, the
recreant bridegroom in that case being
isited with ostracism The betrothal
is usually followed by marriage just as
soon as the serices of the priest can
be secured The marriage ceremony is
followed by a feast more notable for
the abundance of things to drink than
for things to eat and by the usinil
dance Indeed the festiities are often
prolonged for seeral nights after the
wedding— Southern Workman

Influence of SalnteBcne
SainteBeue is the foremost literary
critic of the nineteenth century in the
Influence he has exerted upon his fel
lows In a ery real sense Matthew
rnold in England and Tame in
France are his disciples, or at least he
Is their literary ancestor They de
rie from him, and the doctrines they
hae niade explicit are often implicit
in him The part of Talne's critical
theory which has withstood the test of
time is that which Tame acquired from
SainteBeue, and not a few of the
points which rnold pressed insist
ently on the attention of all who read
English he took oer from his French
predecessor There are no real critics
of literature of our time, from Mr
Janies in merica to M Brunetiere in
France, who hae not cqme under his
spell at some period of their own de
elopment and who hae not sharpened
their own ision by a more or less de
liberate application of tho methods

Some Whose Water re Churned
\Vlth Magic or Miraculous Power
Though there are hundreds of wells
supposed to possess magical " powei
scattered all oer England, the general
public is ignorant of their locality oi
the romantic stories connected with
eacli one There may be a possible ex
ception in the well of St Keyne, irj
Cornwall, for'Southey has made It fa
mous in a witty little poem The mag
ic of its waters Is such that the hus
band or wife who drinks first from ii
after leaing the altar will hae the
upper hand oer the mate for their
joint lies The bride of whom Southey
tells uh did not wait till after the mar
riage ceremony to pity a isit to the
well, but took the precaution of taking
abottle with her to the church
nother well, in Monmouthshire,
which has a peculiar fascination for
the unmarried maidens is known is
the "irtuous well" For generations
the maidens of that locality hae ac
credited it with marelous powers in
forecasting their futures They hae
only to drop a pebble into Its water
and count the resultant bubbles, for
each bubble represent? a month of
waiting for the day which will make
them brides In order to propitiate
the genius which presides oer the well
It is necessary to decorate the bram
bles which shade it with bits of white
cloth
Then there are the so called holy
wells which hae many medicinal ir
tues Such a one is St Winifred's, at
Ilolywell, which is accredited with
cures that are almost miraculous The
legend of its origin is a ery pretty
one It is said that twele centuries
ago St Winifred, the winsome daugh
ter of a Welsh chief, was wooed by
Prince Caradoc, a prince of ill repute
She declined his persistent adances,
and at last he killed her in a fit of
rage From the spot on which St
Winifred's lifeblood fell there gushed
forth a stream of crystal water which
has worked miracles in her name for
so many centuries
Practically all the ills to which the
flesh is heir can be cured by one or an
other of these wells St Nlnan's, In
Cornwall, is said to restore lunatics to
sanity, but the patient must be Im
mersed in the water and held there un
til the breath has nearly left his body
This seems a heroic measure But een
this is not so seere as the treatment
which must be endured if a madman is
to be cured at Llaudegla well, in
Wales, for after the ictim is nearly
drowned he is trussed like a fowl and
laid under the communion table of the
neighboring church for 1 the night

eep in the heart of each man and
fcoman lies some unfulfilled ambition
toward which his efforts tend as a
goal With Myra arling It was a
gold watch  •
Her days were passed behind a
counter where a ariety of neckwear
was displayed The remuneration was
small and sered only to proide her
with a "home" and the simplest of
gowns The watch for which her soul
hungered might hae been the moon
or the Roc's egg But more, trying
than the priations she endured was
the cheapness, the narrownesa of her
life, so different from the gentle sur
roundings of her girlhood
It was her birthday, her eighteenth
year, and Sunday— a dry free from the
aisle walker's espionage, a happy com
bination which Myra enjoyed to the
full  long afternoon In the crisp,
cool air of the park was a happy cli
max
It was turning dusk as she left the
park The city lamps already shone in
a long line down the aenue On the
side streets the shadows fell black
and ugly, causing a few buildings to
stand out in bold relief Suddenly a
flash from a passing automobile struck
a small, round object that glittered
near the curbing Myra bent oer to
pick Hup Had some beneficent tairy
godmother thrown the gift at her feet?
It was a watch, and on, her birthday!
She seized It rapturously and, looking
neither to the right nor left, fled up
the steps of her boarding house, neer
pausing until she stood In the hall room
she called her home She lighted the
gas and drew down the shaire, then
breathlessly examined her new found
treasure The small hunting case was
of gold, with no mark to identify it,
and set in diamonds
"You little beauty," whispered the
girl as she caressed it with her fingers
Then, with woman's curiosity, she tried
to open the back It was difficult, but
at last Myra gasped with surprise The
face of a young man, with honest eyes
and kindly mouth, looked into her own
"I wonder if he owns the watch?"
she thought "Xo, it's a woman's trin
TOM H PRESENTE MTR VH'HH  GOL
WTCH,
kct He must hae gien it to the
girl—and if so he"—
Myra abruptly closed the case But
she could not shut out the face from
ber mental ision
She passed her eening rocking slow
ly in her chair, with a magazine be
tween her fingers, the gentle ticking of
the watch counting the passing hours
That night she dreamed not of the
watch, but of a life which the watch
typified, and through the dream stalked
a man whose face was the face in the
watch
She awoke a little after G to reel
in the delight of knowing the exact
hour and turning luxuriously oer for
another fifteen minutes
ll day she thought about her won
derful acquisition and smiled happily
to herself The other girls noticed it
and twitted her in their good natured
if rather coarse way; Slyra laughed,
but guarded her secret and hurried
home to pass another eening of tle
lightful possession Three days passed,
and, though the watch itself was Personal\
neer failing source of delight, as the
actual realization of her dreams It was
the picture that crept into her heart
She told her secrets to those honest
eyes and called him "dear friend" lie
seemed somehow to understand her
eery whim
"The whole world could trust you,
and— l'd trust you absolutely," she told
him one night ery softly "The otlier
girl trusts you too? The other girl!
How sorry she must be to lose your
picture!"
Then suddenly, without any warning,
Myra awoke to the truth The watch,
the picture, were not hers! She had no
right to keep them She turned to the
window and looked drearily out oer
the roofs of houses
"I neer thought of it, not once
They're not mine They are hers Hers,
and I kept them, it's the same as
stealing 1 neer thought"
•I'btit "iioou she spent half an hour
nflining oer newspaper \ea in tho
library She fotynd thp description la
the "Lost and Found" column anil
made note of ' f he " address with eyea
grown misty
She put oft! the eil day until Sunday
and decided^ to enjoy to the full her
last day of the fairy gift which was to
anish 60 soon She slipped a narrow
blaijk ribbon on the watch and reck
lessly wore it all day She did not
dare to look at It or exhibit it to the
girls, but the knowledge that it was
ticking steadily in her belt brought
;omfort
"Can I see the lady— the one who
lost her \atchjr"' she aafred nnd_she
Fie Cents Per Copy
was at once snown into' a room wnn
luxurious appointments There was a
log fire in the grate, with comfortable
lounging chairs and books hi eery
aailable space It carried Myra back
to those other days now dim in her
memory
"You hae found my watch? How
glad I am!" The speaker came close
to Myra, with outstretched hands and
eager smile She was as beautiful as
any of the women whom Myra sered
during business hours
The girl laid the watch In the other's
hand Surely with all Miss Shepherd
possessed she could hae spared this
toy, but It was hers, and she must hae
it
"It was my mother's,"  said Miss
Shepherd softly "That is why I can
not thank you enough nd you will
accept this little acknowledgment?"
she said, trying to press a roll of bills
into Myra's clenched hand
"No," "said Myra "It's yours L I 
want nothing"
"But I promised a liberal reward" i
"nd I had it— all the week The
watch was such good company" She
did not mention the picture
nd to all Miss Shepherd's argu
ments and entreaties Myra reiterated
"No" The picture held her firm She
could not take the money for that
In the end she allowed herself to
be persuaded to remain until the rain
ceased and to drink a cup of tea
• "Here's Tom You must meet him!"
exclaimed her hostess proudly as the
door swung open and there entered the
original of the photograph
One look from Myra, and then her
lashes drooped in embarrassment The
others discussed the watch and its re
coery t first Myra could scarcely
follow what they said, but they were
so kind, so full of interest about her
and her little  experiences, that she
soon found herself chatting freely and
laughing at Tom's funny sayings; still
she rose hi trepidation to find how
late it had become
Tom (she had not discoered his oth
er name) insisted that as his automo
bile was at the door he would take her 
home, i
"Oh, no!" gasped Myra in distress,
turning to her hostess "I'd rather
take a car"
"on't you like motors?" questioned
Miss Shepherd kindly
"I'e— l'e neer tried one," admit
ted Myra
"Then that settles it," exclaimed
Tom, and Myra found herself hurried
to the door, with Miss Shepherd exact
ing a promise that she would come
again
"Yes, do!" urged Tom as they'went
down the steps "She really means it
Isn't she jolly?"
"She's ery kind How happy she
must be— so pretty and such a beauti
ful home, and— and you"—
Myra had not meant to say that at
all It just slipped out
"You bet She's the best sister that
eer a fellow had" 
"Your sister?" stammered Myra, and
somehow in her surprise she nearly
missed the step of the motor car, but
Tom caught her
"Of course What else did you
think?"
Myra felt her face flush hotly She
trembled a little, but she did not say
just what she thought In fact, Bhe
did not tell him until the following
Christmas Tom had presented Myra
with what had once been the desire of
her heart, a gold watch
"I can't take anything 8o hand
some," she had said, shaking her head
earnestly
Tom only laughed The case flew
back, and there was the one face in all
the world for Myra ' Personal ; V
"Sweetheart, 1 claim a liberal re
ward," said Tom "Please take me
too"
THE CHRYSNTHEMUM
The first chrysanthemum show was
held hi Norwich, England, In 1829

The first chrysanthemums brought to
Europe were taken from China by skip
pers of the tea trading ships
fter the chrysanthemum is potted
leae it for a little time in the shade
Then gie it all the sun that is possible
The chrysanthemum was introduced
into England 200 years ago from Chi
na It was grown first in Holland aft
er its emigration
The chrysanthemum is one of the
easiest of garden flowers to grow, but
it needs careful tending after it is
brought into the house in pots when

THE SENTORIL BOOLERS
• Whateer the result of the pros
ecution of the senatorial quartet —
Bunkers, French, Emmons and
Wright — through the criminal
courts, public opinion has already
pronounced a erdict of guilty They
hae betrayed the trust reposed in
them by a too confiding people; for
the paltry sum of $350 they hae
sold themseles, and brought dis
grace upon the state California
has been hard hit by legislatie scan
dals heretofore, but nothing so de
grading has defaced her history as
this latest story of boodle In the
presence of the facts adduced will
the senate expel the unworthy mem
bers That is the question Noone
contends that they should be con
demned unheard They might hae
had their say before the special com
mittee, but not under conditions that
would hae precluded their punish
ment through the courts They
hae no cause for complaint that
they were not allowed to meet sworn
testimony against them, by their
own testimony under oath If they
were able to show, as they claim,
that the whole affair is a conspiracy
to ruin them, the mere refusal to place
them under oath would not hae
caused them to remain dumb They
were figuring to tie the hand of justice
in the courts They did not succeed
But the question of expulsion or
whitewash must be passed upon by
the senate before the trial in court
can be had Let us hope for the
reputation of the state that senators
will manfully face this issue Let it
not go forth that California, through
its chosen representaties, is in sym
pathy with boodle and boodlers
Russia is determined to win a ic
tory before quitting She will listen
to no peace oertures until she has
whipped the Japs ia one standup
fight nd if she were lucky enough
to win one battle she would want to
gain another and another, until she
had crushed her aliant foe The
prospect is slim for a reersal of the
story of misfortune and disaster in
the least degree She has had such
an unchecked career of conquest for
centuries that it is hard to reconcile
herself to the thought that her pol
icy of expansion must be abandoned
Like the ineterate gambler, who
stays with the game until his ability
to do so is exhausted, so Russia
hangs on to her dream of world con
quest, until her military arm is para
Ilyzed by defeat abroad and reolu
tion at home Japan, is doing noble
serice for the world's peace by
soundly thrashing this oergrown
bear, and throwing back her frontier
from Manchuria and the whole Pacific
, coast

lone s the Railroad
[Communicated]
That many of the lone people feel a
little sore oer the extending of the
railroad further eastward, no one will
deny The beautiful little alley city
had been the terminus so long that
many of her citizens had grown to be
liee that it should always be thus
Enterprises that were calculated to be
of lasting benefit to the place are now
being characterized as next to worth
less, and the blame is being laid at the
doors of the railroad extension pro
moters, lone is too stable a town to
be materially injured by the railroad
passing beyond her borders She is
situated at the head of one of the most
fertile alleys in the state, and in close
proximity to another equally as good,
whose products must be marketed with
her business men Large holdings in
these fruitful alleys must be sub
diided, population increased, now in
dustries fostered, and it will be but a
matter of a few years before the enter
prising portion of the people of lone
will be reaping a benefit from this new
order of things If we were the owner
of property in lone today, we would
placo just as groat a alue upon it as
formerly The blacksmith may not
hae so many horses to shoe, but he
will hae more plows to sharpen The
hotel proprietors may lose a quarter
now and then from a teamster, but
they will take in a dollar occasionally
from the farmer who has brought his
family into town to buy a month's sup
plies The liery man may miss hiring
his teams to a drummer occasionally at
$225 per day, but the improed condi
tion of our public roads will enable him
to get $00 por day for tho same team
from one of the welltodo young farm
ers in the community, and so on
throughout eery line of business,
lone by koeping her grammar and high
schools on a high piano can and will
become the center of education in the
county Nothing will induce fond par
onts to locate in a community quicker
than superior oducational " facilities
Let the people of the alley town look
to nothing but her educational interests
during tho next few years, and eery
dwelling that, her wealthy men will
erect can be readily filled with desirable
tenants On the other hand, neglect
the educational interests and many of
those already there will be drien away
From our point of iew the future of
lone is in the hands of her own people
and not tho railroad What is for the
best interests of tho many is always, in
the end, beneficial to the few Let the
road be extended to the extreme east
ern portion of tho county, and the
beneficial results will reach beyond its
westorn borders z
VOLCNO ITEMS
Peace, happiness and contentment
reign supreme in our quiet little town
No grumblers, no knockers, but with
eeryone liing and willing to let others
lie we moe quietly on, waiting for
the noise and bustle that is sure to be
ours when the railroad comes, and
when some of our aluable quartz leads
are opened up in proper shape and
made to yield up their hidden treasures
Grillo Bros, hae added a large stock
of goods to those recently purchased
from tho Clute estate, and now hae
one of the neatest and best eauipped
stores to be found in any mountain

supply the demands for goods that are
continually pouring in upon them
Cassinelli Bros, report business better
for this time of tho year than for many
years past They are the owners of
seeral quartz claims, and expend quite
a sum each year doing assessment
work Seeral of their claims are
showing up well
T J Quinn, our blacksmith, says he
is the busiest man in mador county
He has made more wagons and carts
during the last 18 months than any
other one man could make in that time,
and cannot keep one on hand long
enough to exhibit his workmanship
ll agree that T J is a wonderful
worker, and the grocery men, butchers,
and baker are willing to wager their
all that he has the biggest appetite
that can be found any where in the state
Jack Giannini, the town shaer,
closed his doors Sunday at 11Personal30 a m,
and tried to form a combination with
his chair, mug and razors not to do
any work on tho Sabbath day after
that hour His razors had such a keen
edge for business, howeer, that Jack
was oerruled, and continued to lather

30c for his day's work

The editor seems to be a standingPersonalcandi
date for some public position, and does
not appear to be particular as to place
This time he is out for the clerkship of
one of the new courts soon to be put
into operation It is an appointie
office, and if he can show to the go
ernor by facts and figures that the
Record was instrumental in bringing
about the goernor's election two years

cure the appointment If not, we
would adise the officeseeking editor

djudged Insane
W B Vandament, of Oleta, was
brought to Jackson Saturday by con
stable Lessley and adjudged insane by
rs Gall and Endicott He was at the
county hospital boing cared for by
superintendent LeMoin until Tuesday,
when he was taken to t # he state institu
tion at Stockton by deputy sheriff Kay
 This case is peculiar^ The patient
is 72 years of ago, and his affliction has
been coming on for the past two years,
gradually growing worse His mania
takes on the form that he imagines
that he is afflicted with microbes, and
all his energies are concentrated upon
trying to free himself from them He
thinks ho can catch them, tries to dig
them out of his skin, pulls his hair out
under the same impression He would
pack his bedclothes outside and beat
them day after day under the same de
lusion Eerything to him is infected
with microbes s a matter of fact he
is cleanly in his habits; the microbes
exist in his imagination; for all that
they are terribly real to him He thinks
others are afflicted in the same way,
and hence is dangerous, inasmuch as
he is liable to resort to desperate meas
ures to rid others of the imaginary
nuisance Onco he attempted to set
fire to a lady in order to destroy the
microbes On other subjects he is per
fectly sane When the witnesses de
tailed his actions hetold the judge that
they were perfectly correct in their
statements The doctors hold out little
hope of his restoration to a normal
condition
Fined SSO For Refusing to ssist an
Officer
Ignorance of the law sometimes gets
good men into trouble This was the
case with James Bodlnar of mador
City last week, when deputy sheriff 
S Gray asked him to assist in placing
the handcuffs upon the wrists of a man
under arrest No one will dony the
fact that Mr Bodinar is a peaceable,
lawabiding citizen, and would in no
wise iolate the laws of his country if
he properly understood them It is
the duty of eery ablebodied male citi
zen to assist a peace officer in the per
formance of his duty if called upon to
do so This Bodinar flatly refused to
do, and deputy Gray took adantage
of the occasion to gie him an import
ant and rather expensie lesson on the
duty of merican citizenship  war
rant was secured for his arrest and he
was taken before justice Rose, where
ho plead guilty and was fined $50, which
he promptly paid, feeling that a know
ledge of the law sometimes comes high,
but it is worth tho knowing at any
price

John Werly Set Free for ttacking Clough
 dispatch from Oakland dated Feb
1th saysPersonal  jury decided today that
it was no crime for John Werly to at
tack Fred R Clough with a pickhandle
one night last Noember when he found
Clough in the company of Mrs, Werly
It was a murderous looking weapon
Werly used, but Clough, it was ex
plained, was a much bigger man
Though Werly did not want to kill
Clough, he wanted to inflict sufficient
injury to impress the idea of a igorous
protest ' fter committing the assault
he was arrested on complaint of Clough,
who charged him with assault with a
deadly weapon The jury was not out
more than long enough to cast ono bal
lot There were no dissenting oices
The testimony showed that Weriy,
who is a middle aged man, had been
made miserable by the attentions paid
his wife He followed the couple down
town on the night of Noember 12, and
waited outside while they had supper
in a Ninth street restaurant While
waiting Policeman Morrison came
along his beat, and seeing Werly in a
doorway asked him what he was doing
Werly thereupon told him his story
and asked Morrison what he would do
in the circumstances, especially if the
man were bigger than he Morrison's
reply was, "I would whittle him down
to my size and then go for him"
Werly followed the "cop's" adice in
his own way

known in the neighborhood of Pine

BLEW HIS HE OFF
Thomas Blatzer Commits Suicide in Jack
son Valley by Shooting Himself • ;
The body of Thomas Blatzer was
found dead in his cabin on the ranch
of Geo Yager in Jackson alley under
circumstances which indicated suicide
It is thought the act of selfdestruction
was committed on Sunday, as the
neighbors bad not seen him around
since Saturday last eceased was a
young man about 28 years of age, and
for the past year had been employed in
cutting wood on the Yager place near
Buena Vista He lied alone, and from
what transpired at tho inquest gae
not the slightest hint by word or dis
position that the idea of suicide pos
sessed him Geo Yager and a helper
went to the ranch Tuesday morning
for the purpose of catching up some
stock Yager repaired to the dwelling
of Blatzer for the purposo of getting a
piece of rope There he found Blatzer
lying on the floor dead, the top of his
head blown off by the discharge of a
shotgun,  doublebarreled shotgun
lay by his side, one barrel of which was
empty, the other loaded  stick had
been tied to the trigger in such a way
that the weapon might be discharged
by foot pressure The charge had ei
dently' struck the ictim about the
bridge of the nose, shattering the
skull and spattering brain matter about
the walls of the cabin No cause can
be assigned for the deed" Yager said
no trouble had occurred between them
 note or memorandum,' supposed to
hae been written by deceased, was
found It bore neither signature nor
date It was written in German There
were but a few words, which were in
terpreted to meanPersonal "You hae got
my meat, now you can hae my hide"
No pne was abje to throw any light on
this note, and it was all that was found
to coney the idea that the ictim was
brooding oer' something Coroner G
M Huberty held an inquest on 'Tues
day, the jury finding a erdict of sui
cide eceased was a stranger, with
out relaties so, far as known in the
state He was not known to hae re
ceied any letters by mail The re
mains were brought to Jackson and
interred at the county's expense,
 Our Gamp Opra correspondent gies
the following additional particularsPersonal
The dead body was lying on some
barley sacks spread on the floor, the
head resting on a sack of salt ; His
hands grasped a gun barrel The whole
upper right side of his head was blown
off, his brains were spattered all oer
the wall, and a great pool of blood had
formed beside hln» 'The gun rested
across his body Hiß legs were stretched
out straight, so it is supposed that Lo
placed his knees against a stick which
he had whittled to fit against the trig
ger, and holding the muzzle against
his eye socket straightened out his legs
and so discharged the gun Qnly last
week the unfortunate man told one of
the neighbors that in the spring he was
going back to the old country to isit
his aged father and mother fter the
inquest one man, Roy Healy, remained
with the body oer night, holding lone
igil in that desolate cabin with the
unfortunate man The suicide was
neer known to drink liquor, aqd wts
ery' industrious during the whole time
he has been here
The Railroad
The progress of the railroad for the
past two weeks, although considerable,
hardly justifies the hope that the line
will be in running order to Martell's
within the next month Track laying
has adanced some distance beyond
Kerr's station, or Ranlett, as the depot
will be named Freight is being re
ceied as far as this point Seeral
cars of freight stood on the track at
the time we passed there Saturday
The depot building is being erected,
and in a few days eerything will be in
good shapo for business to this point
The heay filling in the neighborhood
of Cyclone station, where the railroad
will cross the wagon road, still lacks a
good deal of completion nd nothing
has been done in grading on the north
side of the road Howeer, from
Cyclone to Martell's the grading work
is insignificant
Struck SO Bock
Fred Greisbach and Owen Gillick, of
Volcano, recently bonded a mine of
Cassinelli Bros, in the Pioneer district
They had barely commenced operations
on the claim when they encountered a
rich ore body We hae not heard full
particulars, but learn that a seam 8
inches wide is easily $0 rock These
men are good prospectors, and will
make a thorough examination of their
find before they make any hurrah
about it We only hope that the en
tire ledge matter will deelop into $0
rock', run' the entire length flf the
claim, and go dowq beyond the $)0Q

MINING NEWS
Gwin— Immediately following the
report that 50 men were let out at the
Gwin, comes another that a fabulously
rich strike was mado in the north drift
of tho lower leel If the half that we
hear is true, the mine will soon be able
to make a showing equal to that made
during its palmiest days
Treadwell — Some thorough pros
pecting is being done under the super
intendency of a man who has spent a
lifetime in quartz mines So far the
results are satisfactory, and operations
will continue indefinitely
 report was receied Monday that
the mining outlook at and near the
efender was most flattering The
rock at the efender is looking better
than at any time for months, and
Superintendent Joyce is congratulat
ing himself that he did not sell when
opportunity offered itself some time
The Newman Miles claim is showing
up splendidly Each day's work shows
the ledge to a better adantage These
men no doubt hae a second efender
The Railroad Situation
 corps of sureyors, haing com
pleted the surey of the route from
Martell's to Sutter Creek aqd^ mador
City, has been engaged for the past
three days in making a surey of the
line into Jackson The engineering
difficulties in bringing the road to Jack
son are trifling in comparison with
those connected with the northward
extension By way of Jackson Gate
the grade is easy The location pf the
depot is not definitely settled, '" The
talk that it would not come nearer to
town than Bright's field was premature
It is now claimed that two aailable
sites are under consideration, either of
which would be satisfactory to the
business interests There is no desire
here to hae the depot located close to
the business center, nor in the midst of
a residence district  site in the
Eudey field, near the junction pf'tbe
forks of the Volcano road, is under
consideration lso at the Ginocchio
lot on the north side of Court street,
which would inple a portion of the
Barton lot t either of these places
ample room for depot purposes can be
secured
H P Hoey, who has been identified
with the Clark road from §alt Jake to
Los ngeles, arried in Tone "on Tues
day last, to assume charge of the new
road The opening of the line for pas
senger traffic will rest upon his judg
ment It is likely that passenger trade
will be delayed until the line is com
pleted to Mountain Springs, which will
be in a few days They are now put
ting in the two trestles at the bend
from Kerr's to Mountain Springs, aqd
these will take perhaps a week to com
plete, after whlob track laying' to the
depot site at the latter place will be
speedily completed
The lone and Eastern Railroad Com
pany hae bought the Rabb stage line;
also McCall's traction outfit, horses,
wagons and oil tanks, together with
the hauling contracts for the arious
mines Mr McCall will hae charge
of the freighting from Ranlett to the
mines, in behalf of the railroad com
pany It is understood that Fred Rabb
will continue to operate the stage lines
at present, or until the railrqad is in
condition to dispense with that mode
of transportation
Ranlett is now a bustling freighting
point  score of teams start out from
there with freight eery day for Jack
son and other points It has greatly
relieed the situation, as twice the load
can be hauled from this point with the
same number of animals that hae
been heretofore required from lone,
and the trip to the mineral belt can be
made in one half the time
LTER—  meeting of those repre
senting the 'company was held yester
day afternoon, Superintendent Hoe
being present The propositions were
discussed and the meeting adjourned
No question was raised about a bonus
from the people for bringing the road
to Jackson Before leaing town, how
oer, a memorandum was left with
Wilford ennis, witli directions to
make known the contents to the towns
folks after tho railroad magnates left
town Mr ennis loft for lone this
morning, so we were unable to see him
personally, but a citizen took a copy of
this document in writing as followsPersonal
Towns of Jackson and Sutter Creek
must each furnish depot site 200x2500
feet and right of way from Oneida
grounds to depot site'; also must pay
$10,000 in cash as soon as line and de
pot and yards are completed, and an
other 810,000 within some reasonable
time therefrom, say one year
We could not erify by personal
interiew this ultimatum to the citizens
of Jackson and Sutter Creek, but we
hae no doubt of its correctness It
has changed the situation materially
The feeling }s struugl expressed in
Jackson at "east, not to "submit to this
holdup business If presented in the
form of an inestment in the road to
the amount stated, it might be con
sidered, but as a gift to the company
bidding for the trade of Jackson and
icinity, we hae not heard a soul raise
a oice In defense of this big stick
proposition
 Marcucci has taken the boot and
shoe repair business in connection with
the Jackson Shoe Store •Parties ha
ing renair work will find him always
on hand for prompt attention to work
in the rear part of the shoo store

BREKING THE
RECOR
Jeanne Caldwell
Copyright, 190, by T C McClure
The man grasped the leer of the
French touring car, and the crimson
demon stopped so suddenly that it
fairly sprang backward The lane waa
narrow, and the girl who stood directly
in the path of the machine had the im
perious carriage of one who felt she
held the key to the situation When
the dust had subsided, the man saw
that aboe the imperious figure rose a
face of singular charm, surrounded by
an aureole of copperish gold H this
he saw in a flash despite his leather
isor and ugly goggles
The girl came to the side of the ma
chine
"You are Mr Benedict's chauffeur?"
The man nodded his head and made
a motion as if to raise his cap The
girl put one foot on the step
"Yes, I recognized the car I want
you to take me to Barrington as fast
as you can make the machine go"
The man stirred uneasily
"But I am meeting some people at
the 11Personal30 train"—
"That makes no difference," said the
girl, sweeping away his objections with
"wniii xou please thank him fob sib?"
true feminine finality "I will answer
to Mr Benedict for your disobeying or
ders  woman is dying in that cot
tage To sae her life the doctor must
hae certain things from his office In
Barrington, and you must take me for
them" \;
Een before she finished the sen
tence he had thrown open the low
door, and she sprang up beside himPersonal
s she settled Into her place the
mighty car swung round in a circle,
and they were off She unfastened the
eil from her big flat hat, tucked the
latter behind her and tied the tulle
oer her hair, which refused, howeer,
to be confined by such gentle measures
The man saw all this from the tall of
his eye despite the goggles
The " road stretched before them,
smooth and leel as asphalt paement
No teams were in sight
"Faster!" cried the girl impatiently
"You can surely make better time than
this!"
"gainst the law," said the man curt
ly
"Very well, break the law I'll pay
the fine if you are arrested Oh, don't
you understand? I'e neer seen any
one die, and we'e got to get back in
time to sae herl"
The car sprang forward The girl
closed her eyes suddenly She had
neer ridden so fast
"ccident?" hissed the man's oice
in her ear
"Yes; 'she fell and cut herself I waa
driing by in my pony cart when I
heard her groan It was dreadful I
bad neer seen blood before, you know
Just then r Herron droe along He
said something about an artery and
went to making bandages I—l don't
think I was much good—l turned sd
faint Then he wanted to drie back
to Barrington for some things, and—l
—I was afraid to stay alone with her
He wrote the list on a paper, and 1
was Just starling with the pony cart
when I heard your machine The doc
tor says she has just one chance in a
hundred You were the chance"
The car stopped at the top of the bill
"Brace yourself," said the man curt
ly Then came the plunge downward
It seemed to the girl as if the wheels
did not strike the ground as they
passed through space When they,
reached the foot of the hill she realized
suddenly that the chauffeur had been
holding her in the car with an arm
firm and unflinching He did not apol
ogize when he remoed Its support
They were turning into the illage
"Which street?" he demanded nd
she pointed to a white gabled cottage
Hewas eidently a well trained chauf
feur of a multimillionaire bachelor
He knew enough to keep his place and
not to take adantage of an awkward
situation
The doctor's wlfo followed her to the
car, talking olubij
"Now, don't you stay around that
place, fretting your soul out, Miss Carle
ton The doctor will get some neigh
bor to stay with her"
Tbe car panted up tbe hill
•Isn't this dreadful?" asked the girl
nerously "Oh, excuse me; I know
yott are making good time, but it
seems as It we were crawling That

woman has the dearest baby She can
oot die and leae the poor little thing
ill alone"
"id you eer think, Miss — Misa
Carleton," said the man, watching her
curiously, "that the baby might be bet
ter off if the mother died? The wom
an is poor You or some other rich
woman might adopt the child end gie
tt n better home than the mother eer
could"
"No, you don't understand So many
men say such things because they do
not understand women — and babies
It isn't the home; it's the loe" She
had forgotten that the man beside her
was a serant She was thinking only
of the baby that had cooed confidingly
in her arms while the doctor worked
oer its mother "I'e seen it curled
in her arms If she died, no arm would
encircle it in just the same way No,
you can't understand, because you are
a man But I— l'e felt always that I
was cheated out of something—some
thing that eery other girl I knew had
— a mother There's a loneliness — I
can't Just tell you what it Is Some
times it comes in the dark when you

The man did not answer, but the ma
chine did It gae a despairing groan
and shot up the incline in a way that
would hae made Its makers proud
The touring car stood outside the
humble cottage until the girl came out
again Her eyes shone like stars
"We got here in time She is alie
I thank you ery much Is Mr Bene
dict coming home today?"
The man nodded and put a hand on
the leer
"Will you please thank him for me?—
and I will do so in person when we
"Mr Benedict, if you are ery good
you may take Miss Carleton out to din
ner," said his hostess "You know she
has deeloped into a haughty Berkshire
beauty"
"Little Mame Carleton?" he mur
mured  VV'
"Yes; only since she is old Charley
Carleton's heiress they spell it with a
•y'— 'Mayme' "
They crossed the room to where Miss
Carleton was chatting with her host
She extended her hand cordially
"I am glad to see Mr Benedict home
again, and' especially glad to hae this
early chance to thank him for his tour
Ing car, which I borrowed so uncere
moniously this afternoon"
"nd my chauffeur?"
t sound of his oice Miss Carleton
looked around as if for support, but
host and hostess had drifted away
"II thought"—
"Of course," he said, with a quizzical
laugh, "it has heen fie years since last
we met— and then there were the gog
gles" He was looking at her hair "I
think I like It best tied down with a
eil," he remarked Irreleantly
"Please send your carriage away and
let me take you home in my car," he
urged She hesitated, then gae the
order, and they went back oer the
Barrington road
"We broke the record right here," he
said gleefully as they slowly climbed
the hill Then his oice turned serious
"I like to break records— and yet here
I'e wasted fie years away from you,
wandering the world oer I neer real

that I was lonesome too I'e been

Once I was assistant to an elderly
doctor in Ontario, who also ran a drug
store He was as peppery as a cay
enne pod, and from time to time cus
tomers and patients sprang jokes on
him just for the fun of hearing him
growl On one occasion a well dressed
young fellow called at the shop and
asked the doctor to prescribe for a
breaking out and a rash on his left
arm The doctor examined the limb
and pronounced It to be a bad case of
eczema   • ' V't
"I suppose, doctor, you can cure itT'
said the patient
"Why, certainly," repliedstbe doctor
"How long will it take to get well?"
"Oh, I guess about two months"
eald the doctor
"Quite sure, sir Is it a bad case?"
"Positiely the worst I'e seen"
"Then I will leae it with you and
call for It again when cured," solemn
ly said the patient, slowly unfastening
his arm, which was an artificial one
and painted for the occasion—Pear

Klnl the Oldest of Bird
In New Zealand is found the kiwi, »
strange bird of the ostrich family Os
triches hae two toes, but the extinct
moas had three toes; so also hae the
existing emus, cassowaries and rheas,
r South merican ostriches The kiwi,
howeer, differs from the other stru
thious birds in haing four toes Fur
ther, the kiwi cannot be said to bo
quite ostrlchllke, for In size it is not
larger than an ordinary barnyard fowL
It has a small head, with a large and
muscular neck and a long slender bill,
with the distinguishing feature that
the nostrils are placed close to its tip
The legs are short, but the muscles on
the thighs are well deeloped, and the
feet are strong and powerful and pro
ided with sharp claws The kiws 
bird deoid of any external trace of
wings, and there is no trace of tall is
ible, while it is coered with long, nar
row hairllke feathers, and on the for»
part of the bead and sides of the face
are straggling hairllke feelers—Chica

I WYS OF THE MOOSE
CHRCTERISTICS OF THE NOBLEST
OF LL WIL NIMLS
Tlie LaiKent of the eer Family, LIT
Ing or Extinct— The lnakiui Bui
Moose nae the Greatest ntler
The Cow and Her Ungainly Calf
Now and then In wanderings througt
the mountain and forest one comes up
on a gigantic blackish brown dcci
which by reason of the great length ol
its yellowish gray legs stands highei
than a tall horse It is clothed ii
coarse, bristly hair, longest on the neci
and shoulders, and it has a rather uglj
oerhanging nose which distlnguishei
it at once from all other kinds of deer
From the throat of the male hangs t
long hair coered appendage known as
the "bell," and in the fall and wintei
he has also a pair of widespreading
antlers, ery heay and much flattened
or "plamated" He stalks the forest
through undergrowth and oer fallen
trunks like a king of giants, or, ii
alarmed, he speeds away at an amaz
ingly swift swinging trot and with a
crashing which resembles the sound o!
falling trees! Such is the moose, th
largest of all deer, liing or extinct
The moose is chiefly an animal of the
northern woods, the southern limit ol
its range being the head of Green ri
er, ' Wyoming It is also found Id
northern Maine, New Brunswick,
southern Canada, Idaho, British Colum
bia, lberta, thabasca, Yukon and
laska It is strictly a dweller of the
forest, seldom enturing to treeless
plains It lies for the most part by
browsing on the leaes, twigs and bark
of trees," particularly young trees In
order to reach the tops of tall saplings
the moose rears up against them, strad,
dling them with his long legs and lit
erally riding them down He is fond
est of birch, hemlock, alder, aspen, wil
low and maple He also eats mosses
and lichens
In May the "cow," as the female
moose is called, gies birth to a long
legged, ungainly, tawny colored calf,
to protect which the mother will fight
any woodland creature to the death
She has no antlers, but she can use
ber great sharp hoofs with the skill of
a prize fighter and has been known to
pound to death a large black bear and
fairly trample his body into the
ground The calf stays with its moth
er for two or three years, or until he
wanders off to seek a mate for him
self One day last summer I came sud
denly upon a coyr moose standing knee
deep in a shallow pond, while from
beneath her neck ber grotesque looking
calf peered out at me with eyes wide
open, as if with astonishment I hur
ried home and returned with a camera,
but when I reached the spot they were
gone
 Like all merican deer, the "bull"
moose sheds and renews his antlers
eery year They become full grown,
hard and sharp about the Ist of Octo
ber, the beginning of the breeding sea
son t thistime of year the bulls are
ery saage and not only fight furious
ly among themseles, but are apt to
attack anything or anybody who comes
In their way
The call of the bull is a long drawn
bawl with seeral loud grunts at the
end If there is a cow within hearing
she will answer with a low cry, and
the bull will come forward to meet
her Hunters often take adantage of
this fact and attract tbe bull by an
Imitation of the call of the cow, exe
cuted on a cone shaped horn made of
birch bark Lying concealed on the
bank of a lake or stream, they gie
out the call, and when the bull comes
Within range they shoot him But as
this trick Is usually played at night
and as the bull sometimes neer gies
any warning of his coming until he Is
almost on the spot the sport is apt to
be dangerous The bull at such a time
Is in no mood to be trifled with, and
unless the hunter is cool headed and a
good shot the moose Is not only willing
but ery able to kill him and a dozen
like him if they happen to be on the
spot
Probably the largest moose of which
there is reliable record was shot by
Carl Rungius, the animnl painter, in
New Brunswick in 1901 This great
beast stood seen feet high at the
shoulders, and the length of its head
and body together was nine feet seen
Inches The laskan moose hae the
largest antlers, and one pair from an
animal shot on the Kenai peninsula
lias a spread of seentyeight and a
half inches and has thirtyfour points
With the dry skull to which they are
attached these antlers weigh ninety
three and a quarter pounds, a weight
which nothing but an animal of gigan
tic strength could carry at top speed
jer the roughest ground and through
thickly wooded country
In the winter, when the snow is deep,
the moose, sometimes seeral families
together, will gather in a certain sec
tion of woodland and be breaking out
paths for themseles oer a space of
perhaps seeral acres from what is
known as a "yard," where, if not dis
turbed, they may stay for weeks to
gether But the moose is able to trael
(eil at all seasons, and een in deep
jnow his long legs enable him to moe
it a pace which astonishes any hunter
iho tries to run him down on snow
shoes
 wild, frc% life is the only one on
which a moose can lie and thrie In
taptilty it is much less nerous than
most deer and is disposed to be gentle
md affectionate But, as a rule, it will
lie but a short time, een though It
jets the same food which it had in its
aatie woods It may apnear to relish
Its food, but it will grow to no great
size and in a short time will probably
|le of inflammation of the stomach
This is one of the noblest wild ani
mals in the world, and it should he gl
su adequate protection throughout Its
range — Bangor Commercial
