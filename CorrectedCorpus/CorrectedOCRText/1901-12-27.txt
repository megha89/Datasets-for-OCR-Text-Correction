Silence You Can See
There is no such thing as silence In
this world It is an Impossibility That
Is partly tbe reason why science has en
abled us to see it >-%\ ! fe
The explanation of the paradox Is
thisPersonal Silence, as we understand It sim
ply means, that there are Personal sound* too
delicate or too loud for the ear to ipis
ter In other words, when we cau't
hear anything we calftbat conditlou
"silence" But whereer you are there
are sounds around you Een In the
deepest mine^the air ibrates- anil
makes a sound An instrument lias
been inented  that will catch these
sounds and permit of the ibrations tie
ing represented pictorlally on a screen,
and in that way you may see-siU'iirr
and properly understand what j it
means I 
; By comparing the pictures of noises
with those of that condition of thins?
known as silence we gain an Idea of the
difference, between  a noisy uigiit for
Instance, and one when "absolute si
lence reigns," as the noelist puts it It
Is rather surprising to find so much dis
turbance at the time wheu eeryihiii;Personal
appears to be perfectly quiet-— Pear

Diplomatic
The late Lord Saile"iised to say ac
cording '• to The Candid Friend, "that
high diplomatists had always to-be on
their guard against intriguing wouiru
mainly Russian agents, who would use
any wile to extract information Dur
ing the Russo-Turkisb war when Eu
rope was always on the erge of a
crisis and   Russian statesmen  were
most anxious to know what England
would do under gien circumstances
a lady came up to him suddenly at a
ball and saidPersonal
"I-hear that the Russians hae made
a forced march and entered Constan
tinople," hoping no doubt that he would
be surprised Into some Indiscreet ex

He merely repliedPersonal "* ~
"Ineed! And I suppose tbe sultan

Wood Too Hard to Barn
There are certain kinds of- wood that
are too hard to burn, or refuse to Ignitp
for some otber reason, such as Iron
wood and the good brier root, but It Is
a curiosity to come across a piece of
common deal— the soft light wood of
which so many boxes are made— that
cannot be set fire to  -, ••
 Tbe piece of wood ln question was
common white deal from Sweden, but
was remarkable for its comparatie
weight It bad formed part of a boat
belonging to a whaler and bad been
dragged below the surface of the wa
ter-to the depth of more than half a
mile by a harpooned whale The
length of line and tbe short distance
from the point of descent after being
struck at which tbe whale rose to the
surface was a proof of tbe depth I to
which it had dragged the boat
Only part of the boat came np again
at the end of the line, and It was taken
on board when the whale had been
killed That piece of wood was jso
hard that it! would not burn in a gas

pressed it— London Standard
Birds' Songs
A French writer, Henri Coupon, says
that, notwithstanding the fact of their
simplicity, the songs of birds cannot be
imitated with musical Instruments be
cause of the impossibility of reproduc

musical scale, also include ibrations

Monkeys
; "All well— all happy— 3lols

One day a keeper accident-
ally broke a bottle of Scott's
Emulsion near the monkey
cage and tl\e monkeys eagerly
lapped it up from \ the floor
This suggested the idea that it
might do them good Since
then the monkeys hae receied
regular doses and the keepers

THE FIRST AERONAUT
HIS INITIAL FLIGHT INTO SPACE WAS
AT PARIS IN 1783
Pllatre dea Rosier* Wu the Pioneer
of the Long Llue at During Spirit*
; Who Perished In Their Attempts to
Naigate the Air
The first attempts to make ascen
sions by means of balloons were made
in' Paris in the year 1783 Pilatre dcs
Hosiers was the first-and most illustri
ous of the'lonVlist of aeronauts 'who
hae fallen ictims to their desire to
adance the artof aerostatics '
In July and 'August of the yearl7B3
balloons filled with hydrogen gas were
sent up from Paris, and in September
at Versailles the first balloon was gent
up freighted with liing animals ' -
In the same year Montgolfler i con
structed a  balloon which be claimed
would be/ capable of carrying passen
gers, "his workshop being In the gardens
of the Faubourg St Antoine The bal
loon was sixty feet in height and forty
eight ' broad* Its exterior was richly
painted and embroidered, there being
represented upon it the twele signs of
the zodiac, the arms of the king; of
France and numberless fleurs-de-lis and
lower down, amid a crowd of grotesque
heads and garlands of flowers, a flock
of eagles, with extended wings, that
seemed to be flying and supporting the
huge balloon upon their shoulders
Below the balloon proper was con
structed a circular platform of wicker
work, coered with silk, which was
used as a car This platform was ery
large and was surrounded by a balus
trade to preent the aeronauts j from
falling out In the center of this plat
form or car was an opening,; below
which was suspended by chains an Iron
stoe, which was to be used for rarefy
ing the air ln the balloon, while ln one
corner was a magazine intended for the
storing up of an immense quantity; of
straw, which sered as fuel   • gj 
) Pilatre dcs Rosters,' generally alone,"
but at one time accompanied by "the
Marquis d'Arlandes and on another oc
casion by M Girond de Villette, had as
cended in the balloon without cutting
the rope which , held it captie to a
height of 1290 feet
' Rosters had much difficulty in obtain
ing permission from the king to make
an ascent without being held down by
the rope, bin consent was at last se
cured, and  on the 20th of Noembjer,
1783, eerything was made ready Dur
ing the day the wind and rain were io
lent and iPersonal was > found necessary jto
postpone thi- ascent The nest day,' the
21st, the weather was more faorable,
and at 1Personal30 in the afternoon In the pres
ence of the dauphin and his suit Pi
latre dcs Rosiei-s and the Marquis d'Ar
landes set out together from the Jar
dins de la Muette upon the first aerial
oyage eer attempted and performed
The wind was still ery rough and the
weather stormy, but in 'spite of these
disadantages the balloon rose rapidly
Haing [Kissed oer Paris and be
come free from all fear of getting en
tangled among the buildings of the city,
the aeronauts suffered themseles ito
descend considerably until they found
themseles in a fresh current of | air,
which bore them in a southerly direc
tion ' r_
After proceeding a few miles farther
the fire 'was allowed to die out, and the
balloon descended about fie inilesTrom
Paris When the aeronauts returned to
the Chateau de la Muette, they were
greeted with the utmost enthusiasm by
the assembled crowds Benjamin Frank
lin was a witness of the whole specta
cle, and when asked what he thought
af it be replied, "I hae seen a child
born -which may one day be a man" i
Aerostatics had adanced to such a
ilegree that on ; the j 7th of January,
1785, Blanchard, a rial of Rosters,
crossed oer the channel from Doer
to Calais '
Rosters was spurred on by Blanch
ard's success and set to work con
structing a balloon which, when com
pleted, he called an aeromontgolfier
It consisted of an Immense balloon of
hydrogen gas, with a large cylinder
placed under it, the use of it being to
rarefy the air without losing gas
! When a faorable day had arried,
Pllatre for the last time made his
preparations He was assisted by a
Boulogne pbysician named Romaln,
and on June 15, 1785, they stepped Into
the basket, the ropes were cast off and
the balloon rose with the utmost maj
esty from the earth 
When it had risen about 200 feet It
struck a fresh current of air which
took it directly toward the sea It soon
found another current which rapidly
carried it back again It possibly may
hae been the desire of the iu>rouauts
to descend to find a more faorable cur
rent of air, for while opening the ale
to let the cold air Into his cylinder un
fortunately a huge rent was made jin
the balloonPersonal The consequences were
Immediate and horrible At ttat time
the ba)loon was 1,700 feet aboe the
jurface of the earth A few moments
ifterward the two aeronauts lay on
the ground dead and horribly muti
lated •  <;'-';? ;\  Personal
Near the spot where Pilatre dcs Ro
siers was burled a monument Personal was
erected ln 1853 to commemorate the al
most miraculous crossing of the sea by
Blanchard, upon the ery spot of earth
on which that Intrepid aeronaut de
scended He had become for France
a hero, and numbers of inscriptions are
still readable— New York Times Personal

Cords, or 16,000,000 feet, of birch'an

each spool large enough to carry 200

NEW YORK CROWDS
The Different Ways In Which They
Impressed Two Men
"What I like about New York," re^
marked a westerner, "is its tremen
dous energy  The crowds anil bustle
hae upon me JJie exhilarating effect
of a stimulant As I moe along among
the masses on the sidewalks aud look
upon the perpetual stream of ehicles
of all descriptions in the streets I am
conscious of a buoyancy of spirit and
•n increased physical energy
"I ! feel like going all the time, my
mind ' Is brighter and clearer, and,  in
fact, my whole being seems toned np Personal
New York j and its crowds are more
beneficial to me than any resort I hae
eer struck After a two weeks' stay
here I return home feeling like another
man"
"Well, that is strange," said the per
son to whom this statement was made
"Do you know New York has upon me
Just exactly the opposite effect To me
what I might term the surplusage of
Hfe_ here is depressing I am by no
means fond of solitude I hae lied in
a moderate sized city all my life, and
It bores me to stay In the country for
any great length of time, but when I
come to New York and am caught In
the tides of humanity, see the oer
crowded tenements and hae my ears
assaulted with the perpetual din of the
streets I become positiely melancholy
' "I feel what'an Insignificant atom I
am, after all— no more than a drop of
water In a great rier— and the feel-
Ing oppresses me It seems so like
there was nobody here who cared what
became of anybody The only relief I
find from the feeling in In the theaters
I go to a show eery night while I am
here, and of course I enjoy that Im
mensely -But as soon as I hae made
the rounds of the shows I am ready to
return Personal home where 1 know most e
erybody and there are many who care"

Why His Clock Was Slow
There is an Italian fruit dealer, with
a well stocked store near one of the
suburban railway stations, who bas
adopted a unique deice, and one
which shows a deep knowledge of hu
man nature, to hold his own In com
petition with ' another dealer, whose
stand Is some fifty yards nearer the
station than his own A  commuter*
was leisurely peeling a banana in his
store the ottier day when the Italian
remarked Personal
"You gotta fly* minute before your
train" • '•
"No; twenty," replied the commuter,
glancing at a big clock on the wall
"Thata clock fifteen minute slow,"
said the Italian "I keepa it slow

Met His Hatch
That well known historical person
age, Augustus the Strong, elector of
Saxony, has furnished the subject for
many a tale of bis wonderful muscular
power We need refer only to' one
characteristic story in which, howeer,
be met bis match On the occasion in
question be entered a blacksmith's
shop To show his suit bow strong be
was, picking up seeral horseshoes, he
broke one after the other, asking the
blacksmith whether he had no better
When It came f&- paying the bill, the
Elector Augustus threw a six dollar
piece on the anil It was a ery
thick coin The blacksmith took it up,
broke It in half, saying, "Pardon me,
but I hae gien you a good horseshoe,
and I expect a good coin in return"
Another sjx dollar piece was gien
him, but he broke that and fie or six
others, when the humiliated elector put
an end to the performance by handing
the blacksmith a loulsd'or, pacifying
him by saying, "The dollars were prob
ably made of bad metal, but this gold
piece, I hope, is good"
Searching For a Soul

Malte-Brun had Just died On the een

ber,* each proided with a lantern,
slowly made the circuit of the garden,
as If they were searching for something
In the walks When they came to a
large heap of stones, they turned each
one of them oer and then re-entered
the bouse
This curious procession Is an old Nor
man custom The dead person was a

fore interring the dead it is necessary,
according to the tradition, to inesti
gate and see that the soul of the de
ceased Is not concealed In a corner of

Loach Prices and Dinner Prices
Any one who will take the trouble to
compare the lunch and dinner menu
cards of some of the leading restau
rants of New York will make a rather
surprising discoery He will ascertain
that the prices on many dishes are cut
on the dinner card fi'orn 10 cents to 20
cents
A gentleman whose curiosity was
aroused by this singular practice to the
extent that he went to the head waiter
for a mor<i satisfactory reason than the
table waiter could adance was gien
tMs explanationPersonal
"You see," said the waiter, "the gen
erality of men don't care for a heay
lunch- One dish and a glass of milk or
a cup of coffee, with bread and butter,
are sufficient for them; consequently to
preent them from getting off too
cheap we hae to put up the price of
single dishes At dinner time it is dif
ferent A man wants a number of dish
es for dinner, and so we can afford to
make our meats and fish cheaper"
"But do you think that Is exactly"—
"Honest? Why not? It is always
honest to take what people are willing
to pay you for what you hae to sell Is
it not?"— New York Times
Why Hindoos Don't G» Itfad,
,Why are there so few lunatic asy

tion which many a traeler has won
derlngly asked

tirely In accordance with their religion—
that is, their working, eating, sleeping,
as well ns what we usually regard as
our "life" in the religious sense of the
word Eerything Is arranged for them,
and they follow the rules now Just as
they did 2,000 years ago This constant
obserance of the same rules for twen
ty centuries has molded tho brains of
the race Into one shape, ns it were, and
although their rites are queer enough,
yef there |s but an occasional example
of that striking deiation from the
common which is called Insanity in
countries inhabited by the white race
They are fatalists too With them It
is a case of "what Is to be will be"
carried •to the extreme This has In
time gien them the power to take all
things calmly and so freed them from
the anxiety that dries so many white
men into the lunatic asylums

DogPersonal and Wolf
There has been some dispute as to
fbe descent of the dog— whether It Is
an improed progeny of the wolf or a
distinct ariety That it Is a different
species is proed by the fact that the
dog and the wolf will mate and pro
duce offspring Neertheless It is prob
able that the dog is merely descended
from the same original stock with the
wolf
Gnliot's Father
Gulzot lied through the most eent
ful periods of modern France He was
born in 1787 amid the mutterings of the
reolution Gnlzof s parents were mar
ried by a proscribed Protestant pastor,
and his birth was neer legally regis
tered His father, who was an ado
cate, used his talent for public speak
ing in the interests of the persecuted
Protestants and became a marked man
After liing for seeral weeks In dan
ger of his life he was at last arrested,
unwillingly enough, by a gendarme who
knew and respected him
"Shall I let you escape?" said the
man
"Are you married?" replied M Gul
zot
"Yes I hae two children"
"And so hae* I," replied the prisoner,
"but you would hae to pay for me
Let us go on"
They went on, and M Gulzot died on
the scaffold a few days later At this
time Francois, the future statesman,
who was the elder of the two children,
was six and a half years old and al
ways presered the recollection of go
ing to see his father In prison, or what
was euphemistically called the bouse of

He was from the country and stood

"I want twele yards of blue predom

"What?" demanded the startled clerk
"T-twele yards of b-b-blue predom

"I'm sure 1 don't know what you

Not In Order
In a certain Lanarkshire illage a
meeting was called to consider the ad
isability of erecting a bridge oer a
creek which had been heretofore cross
ed by means of stepping stones
The schoolmaster, who presided oer

erection of a bridge in an eloquent
speech, when a local worthy, who was
something of a character and noted for
his outspokenness, got up and Inter

spoke of It as one which tempted him

FOR A RAILROAD
The imports into Placerille by
the railroad, for the year 1901, are
gien at 7000 tons, and the exports
at 4750 tons, making a total of nearly
12,000 tons This is an aerage of
oer 30 tons per day They are now
talking of extending the' line' to the
timber belt beyond Placerille
Thirty tons per day is not a large
business for a railroad, it is true,
but it must be remembered that this
is freight handled at Placerille
alone, and does not include the busi
ness at any other depot A rail
road from lone to Jackson, would
command, in a ery short time,
many times that amount of traffic
It is said that we hae nothing to
ship out That is a statement we
cannot accept Because we are ex
porting comparatiely little now, is
no foundation for the assertion that
we would hae no export business
for a railroad The truth is, we do
not know what resources a railroad
would deelop We hae a fruit
growing country equal to the region
around Placerille; we hae inex
haustible deposits of marble of ex-
cellent quality, all dormant because
of the expense, of getting the pro
*duct to market We do not indorse
the opinion that a good wagon road
will dispense with the necessity of a
railroad Wagon roads are all well
in their place, but they can neer
stimulate business like a railroad
There is nothing in the freighting
business at $350 and $4 per ton the
year round A railroad could haul
freight between lone and Jackson at
$2 per ton and make money That
• would be a high rate for 12 miles of
haulmg — 17 cents per ton per mile
Still we beliee the people of Ama
dor county would not object to pay
ing that rate for the adantages of
railroad communication with the
mineral belt It would be an im
mense improement upon the exist
ing order of things -With ample
power right at our doors in the
Standard Electric Company's works,
it certainly should be a feasible busi
ness proposition to orgauize an elec
tric railroad to bridge the distance
between Jackson and the present
terminus at lone
DEPARTMENT OF MINES
Congressman S D Woods, of this
district, has introduced a bill to
establish the department of mines
and mining The mining interests
of this country hae become so ast
as to demand a special department
of the goernment for their proper
superision The bill, which has
been referred to the committee on
mines and mining, proides that a
cabinet officer, to be known as the
secretary of mines and mining, shall
be at the head of the department,
which officer shall be appointed by
the president, the same as other
cabinet officers, and shall receie a
salary of $8000 per year; an assist
ant secretary is proided for at a
salary of $4000, a chief clerk at
$1800 and such other clerks as may
be authorized by law The geologi
cal surey office is to be transferred
to this proposed department, and
the business of gathering, compiling
and publishing information relating
to the mining industry is to be per
formed by this department The
jurisdiction, superision and control
of mines and mining lands now ex
ercised by the Interior Department
are to be transferred to department
of mines and mining ' An effort was
made years ago to establish a de
partment deoted specially to the
mining interests At that time it
was deemed inadisable to do so
Since then, howeer, the demand
has become so general and strong
that it is more than probable that it
will be acceded to
GET REGISTEREDPersonal
All oters are required to re
register to entitle them to ote at

the present law, reregistration is
required for eery general election
Registration will commence after
the first of next month Quite a
number of citizens hae lost their
otes in this county of late years 
owing to failure to register in time
We hope this coming year this mat
ter will be attended to in ample time
by all republicans The arious
clubs in the county should reorganize
as soon as possible It is in the di
rection of looking after registration
that the clubs can render aluable 
serice to the party We want to
poll eery ote we are entitled to at
the next election, and this result
can be secured by the arious clubs
paying special attention, not only to
seeing that republicans are register
ed, but also that they are registered
in their proper precincts
ECONOMY IN MINING
The San Francisco Chronicle of
the 23d contains the following in
regard to the two 1 great mines of
Amador county, the Kennedy and
OneidaPersonal
Qn the mother lode a reolution
in the economics of mining has taken
place since the early seenties
Then the cost of mining and milling
amounted to $9 per ton, and it was
considered scarcely worth while
handling ore containing less than
$12 per ton In those years the
ein in the Oneida mine in Amador
county was being explored at a big
loss, because the ore was too low
grade to pay expenses At that
time the mine workings were aboe
the 1000-foot leel Now the opera
tions are conducted between the
1200 and 2000 foot leels The re
port for the year ending August
31st shows that the total operating
expenses affecting the mining and
milling of 69,511J tons of ore ex
tracted during the year aeraged
$2,886 per ton The ore yielded
$4,090 per ton, leaing $1,204 per
ton profit An amount equal to
$0,745 was expended on construc
tion account, which raised the total
cost of operating the mine aerage
to $3,631 of eery ton of ore extract
ed In this mine crude petroleum
was recently introduced asa substi
tute for wood as fuel for the opera
tion of the hoisting works, and a
saing of 35 per cent secured through
it Besides, says the superintend
ent in his report, it is more cleanly
and easy to handle Employing this
fuel, the total operating expenses in
August were reduced $0,603 per ton,
and the superintendent is confident
that hereafter these expenses can
be lowered to an aerage of $226
per ton >
In the Kennedy mine, adjoining
the Oneida on the same lode, a er
tical shaft 2600 feet deep has been
sunk and the same equipped with a
rapid hoist for the purpose of re
ducing the cost of operation In
this mine, one of the largest gold
bearing bodies in the State is being
worked On the 2250-foot leel it is
ninety feet in width — all good mill
ing ore Working the mine through
two incline shafts following the dip
of the lode has cost an aerage of
$5 per ton for mining and milling
These shafts hae been ery expen
sie to keep in working order The
new ertical shaft is in the country
rock and may neer need repairs
It is confidently expected that the
total cost of gold-winning will be
brought to the same figure as in the
Oneida— s22s per ton In this mine
there is now in sight 125,000 tons of
workable ore If the ore body on
thc 2250-foot leel is of equal width
on the 2600-foot leel, the olume of
ore in sight will be tremendously
increased

McKinley National Memorial
Judge William R Day, ox -secretary
of state and president of the McKinley
National Memorial Association, has
issued the following- statement to the
public adopted by the trustees at thoir
meeting in Washington, December 7thPersonal
The McKinley National Memorial As
sociation was organized by the imme
diate'personal friends of President Mc-
Kinley to afford an opportunity for the
people of the United States to express
theii- personal loe and deotion to the
late president by the erection of a fitting
memorial at his grae The trustees
were appointed by the president of the
United States, the first meeting for or
ganization haing been held at Clee
land, October 10th It is the distinct
purpose of the association to erect such
a memorial as will fittingly typify those
oxalted qualities of character, simplici
ty, dignity, deotion to duty, and high
ideals that were so f minently exempli
fied in his life and purposes This
memorial is to rise aboe the grae at
Canton, Ohio, whero ho will finally
rest in accord with his own expressed
wish
In bringing tho pnrpo^es of this asso
ciation before the people? the earlier
work has 'been nctajarily one of organ
ization This has progressed rapidly
and satisfactorily It is desired that an
organization be perfected in eery state
and territory, and local organization in
cities, towns, and rural districts, with a
committee in chargo working in connec
tion with the state auxiliary is urged
The public should be gien the fullest
opportunity to subscribe
The trustees desire to express their
deep sense of obligation to the press of
the country for its earnest support thus
far, and to recommend that all news
papers act as agents for the receipt of
subscriptions
By a resolution passed by the Ameri
can Bankers' Association, all banks
hae been designated depositors for
subscriptions All postmasters will re
ceie and forward moneys, and all ex
press companies will issue money orders
free of charge, and, when -necessary,
forward money free •
In foreign countries the ambassadors,
ministers, and consuls of the United
States will receie and forward sub
scriptions
In eery case the name and address
of the subscriber should be forwarded
to the treasurer, Myron C Herrick, 
Cleeland, , Ohio, for preseration in
the permanent archies of the associa
tion, and in order that souenir certi
ficates may be sent to each  The
souenir certificate adopted by the
trustees will be worthy of presera
tion as a work of art and as eidence
of the holder's participation in the
erection of the national memorial It
has engraed upon it a portrait of
President McKinley and, in shadow,
pictures of the president's home at
Canton, the Capitol, and White House
-The public is especially cautioned
against any enterprise attempting to
make capital out of the sentiments of
affection which inspired the desire to
rear at the grae of our late president
a memorial which shall fittingly honor
his memory It is the desire of the
trustees that all contributions shall be
the free-will offering of the people, and
they respectfully request the public to
discourage all propositions which may
seem to hae as their object the ob
taining of money by giing all or part
of the proceeds to the memorial fund
The public is hereby notified that the
McKinley National Memorial Associa
tion has no connection with or relation
to any other association or to any en
terprise of a cemmercial nature
After a conference at this meeting
with the representaties of the William
McKinley Memorial Arch Association
of Washington, the following resolu
tion was adoptedPersonal
Resoled, That it be the sense of the
trustees of the' McKinley Memorial As
sociation that the field of popular sub
scription should bo left to it for raising
the sum necessary to proide a suitable
memorial to the late president at Can
ton, where his body lies; and that this
association should join with the Wil
liam McKinley Memorial Arch Associa
tion of Washington in memorializing
Congress to erect a national memorial
at the Capitol of our country to com
memorate his serices to the nation
The Arch Association acquiesced in
this resolution and has properly ceased
to solicit popular subscriptions, leaing
the field to the McKinley National
Memorial Association, through which
the people of the United States will
build a memorial of affection at the
last resting place of their beloed
president, William McKinley

It seems that there must be some
mistake about the deposit in the
Hibernia saings-bank of San^Fran
cisco in faor of-M C McKinnon, and
which was adertised last week as a
deposit that had been left untouched
for 10 years S N Spagnoli, who
has attended to his business for seeral
years; says that within the past month
he forwarded the pass-book of Mc-
Kinnon to the bank for posting the
semi-annual interest, at the same time
sonding $5 to be added to the deposit
McKinnon is in his old haunts in the
mountains, and was no doubt surprised
to find his name among the list of un
claimed accounts •

JACKSON MINING OUTLOOK
Sinking Continues at the
Argonaut
Negotiations for the Purchase of the
Good Hope— Repairing the Shaft
at the Zeila
Zeila— Mining has been suspended
at the Zeila, on account of the necessity
of repairing the shaft A large force
is working in the shaft, and it is be
lieed that it will be in working order
again by the firstPersonal of February The
sulphurets works cominue in operation
as Usual, the quantity of sulphurets on
band being sufficient to keep the reduc
tion works going until the resumption
of work at the mill, unless something
unlooked for occurs to delay the work
in the shaft- ,
Amador Queen —lt is reported
that a chunk of ore was taken out of
the Amador Queen No 2 last Saturday
that contained about $400 in gold The
mine is being worked on a lease, and
work is directed exclusi ely to hunting
for rich pock V ets "' - ; 
Argonaut — Sinking, operations are
being pushed steadily Ten stamps of
the mill are kept running on half time
on ore from the Hoffman ground The
point where the ore is being extracted
is about 2000 feet from the Argonaut
shaft, and work is much hampered by
distance and lack- of entilation We
understand, - howeer, that tho ore
body improes in size and quality, and
there is scarcely, any room to doubt
that a paying mine has been discoered
within tho limits of the Hoffman ranch
The property is owned exclusiely by
W F Detert The Argonaut company
has the option to purchase Should
that company fail to purchase it other
arrangements will no doubt, be made
for deeloping the property
i J H Tibbits was in Jackson Satur
day He paid off, in behalf of C W
Trotter of New York, claims due for
labor in doing the annual assessment
work on the group of mines owned by
the Trotter interest at Middle Bar
The same parties own the Amador
Queen No 1 Mr Tibbitts informed
us that it is probable that work will be
resumed on this property next spring
By a° decision of the court rendered last
spring the English company, known as
the Jackson Deelopment Company,
was declared to own only the 60-stamp
mill, and was allowed fie years time
in which to remoe said mill Upon
its remoal the ground reerts to the
Now York owners, and all rights of the
English company are therefore con
cluded, as far as the Amador Queen
ground is concerned
Good Hope— Negotiations are in
progress for the sale of this property
to capitalists who are able to work it
We are not in a position to state any
thing definite The pood Hope com
pany has signified its willingness to ac
cept $35,000 cash for the' property
The offer is under discussion It is
thought likely that the deal will be
consummated It will be decided one
way or another within the next month
The Good Hope is considered by min
ing experts to be one of the most
promising locations on the lode It
lies partly within the townsite, and
the deelopment of a paying mine
would Impart an impetus to the town
that has* j not been  experienced for
many years The Anita company,
owning the claim adjoining the Good
Hope on the west, spent a large sum
in prospecting, under the impression
that the Kennedy fissure would be
found therein After a thorough ex
ploration to the depth of 800 feet with
out discoering anything of sufficient
alue to continue prospecting, work
was abandoned about four years ago
The effort to purchase the Good Hope
creates the impression that the Anita
folks are now inclined to the belief that
the gold bearing ein lies to the east
A number of the stockholders of the
Anita are also largely interested in the
Kennedy, and if the sale goes through,
actie operations will soon, thereafter
be started, and prosecuted on a scale
that will set at rest the moot question
whether the main gold belt passes
within the Good Hope boundaries

The Streets
Two teams are at work hauling rock
from the Argonaut dump to the road
between Hoffman's and the brewery
This has always been a, bad' pieco of
road, and is now being treated to a
coating of metal which will make it
compare with any portion of the Ken
nedy grade The rock from the Argo
naut shaft is the hardest kind of green
stone, and ery suitable for road pur
poses When this piece of road is fin
ishedother "portions of Jackson's
street are to be treated in like manner
It is encouraging to see that some at
tention is at last being paid to tbe town
streets by the county authorities Let
us hope that we hae seen the end of
the practical application of the theory
that the streets of the towns are not
subject to superisor control, but
must be looked after at the additional
expense of the" occupants and property
holders Main street, Jackson, has ten
times the amount of traffic of any out
side road, and at the same time has re
ceied about one-tenth of the conside
ration in the way of expenditure of
county funds for its improement

Awaiting Examination for Insanity
There are three patients awaiting
examination for insanity Two of them
are confined in the insane wards at the
hospital, *and one in the basement of
the hall of records One of them has
boon held for nearly three weeks, and
no sign of improement Another was
brought from Sutter Creek a few days
ago His name is William Cassana
It is thought that he may get well in a
short time There is some doubt since
the new lunacy law has been declared
unconstitutional, as to the mode of pro
cedure to commit persons to the insane
asylum The law now in force re
quires that the examination and testi
mony must be taken in open court and
in the presence of the person charged
with insanity The general superin
tendent of state hospitals, F H Hatch,
has had prepared by the attorney gen
eral a set of forms to be used in com
mitting insane persons to the state hos
pitals Samples of these forms hae
been sent to our district attorney
The blanks include affidait of insanity,
order of arrest, order fixing time for
hearing, blanks for physicians', exami
nation, physicians' certificate of insan
ity, judgment of insanity, commitment
of insane persons, and the state of
financial ability of the patient When
filled out, these are to be filed with the
superintendent of the asylum and coun
ty clerk
A ' Collision
As J E Batchelder, wife and child
were returning from Jackson Gate in a
buggy Christmas eening, they mot
with an experience they will not soon
forget The ehicle was being drien
by a boy about 12 years old— a brother
in-law of Batcbelder It was about 6
o'clock, and dark On ascending the
grade at Newmanille, another team
was heard approaching from behind at
a rapid gait The horse of % the Batch
elder party was old and slow, and rea
lizing the danger Batchelder seized the
lines, and endeaored to get out of the
way The carriage from behind, how
eer, ran full tilt into them, swinging
the buggy half round, and finally
capsizing it The occupants were all
thrown out Batchelder escaped ' with
a few bruises about the leg His wife
was badly shaken up, and at first it
was feared that she was seriously in
jured, but happily this proed incor
rect No bones were broken, but the
soreness confined her to bed all next
day The child, two years old, escaped
unhurt ! It was asleep in its mother's
arms at the time of the accident, and
did not wake up until after it was all
oer The occupants of the carriage
that were driing so furiously in the
dark are unknown They did not stop
to render assistance  Batchelder's
buggy was damaged somewhat,  but
not as badly as might be supposed

the building and the arrangement of
the stage scenery were superb, The
pupils, in their rendering ; of arious

Don't Be AfraHl of Work
One thing | that -keeps young men
down Is their fear of work They aim
to find genteel so they
can dress, well, not soil their clothes
and handle things" with the tips of
their fingers t ' They j do not like to
get their shoulders [ under the wheel,
and they* prefer' to gie orders to oth
ers or figure as rwsters and let some
one else do the drudgery »; There Is no
tloubt that; indolence and laziness are
the chief obstacles to success
When we' see a boy who has just se
cured a position take hold of eery
thing with '-both- hands and "jump
right into his work" as if he meant to
succeed, we- hae confidence that ho
will 'prosper-* But if he stands arouud
nnd ; asks questions when told ' to do
hnythlngrif he tells you that this or
that belongs to some other boy to do,
foj it ls not his work; if he does not
try to carry out his "orders In the cor
rect 1 way;' if he wants a thousand ex
planations when asked to t run an er
rand and makes his employer think
that he could, hae done the' whole
thing himself, one feels like discharging
such a boy on the spot, for he Is con
inced that he was not cut out for suc
cess That boy will bo cursed with
mediocrity or will be a failure There
Is no place in this century for the lazy
man He will be pushed to the wall—
Success
Shoulder Protection
In the steel curb shoulder protection
which now forms a part of the equip
ment of almost all caalry the troops
hae a permanent reminder of one of
the most exciting adentures which be
fell Sir [ George Luck, the lieutenant
general commanding the Bengal forces
During the Afghan operations of 1878
to 18S0 he took his regiment, the Fif
teenth hussars,' up to Kandahar and en
countered at Takht-I-Pul a strong body
of hlllmen led by Afghan sowars, who
made things pretty warm for him for a
few minutes In the hand to band
fighting he became engaged with a gi
gantic Pathan, who broke down his
guard and would hae cloen him from
shoulder to belt but that his wife had
sewed on bis shoulders In the lining of
his tunic a couple of steel curb chains,
one of which broke the force of the
slash
The Incident so Impressed the mili
tary authorities in India that what Is
now known as the Luck or "lucky"
shoulder curb was soon afterward In
troduced—Military Mail
A Last Joke
John D Long, In the Massachusetts
campaign of 1878, was making his first
run for goernor General Ben
Butler, who had ' captured the Demo
cratic nomination, and Judge Josiah (',
Abbott, who was the candidate of the
old line Democrats | r U r  1 '- - -
The late Judge Thompson was mak
ing a speech for Abbott before a big
Democratic audience and, after pra is-
Ing the candidate as a jurist and n
statesman, asked sarcastically, ,"And
now who Is this John L-Lr-Long?" So
one answering, he proceededPersonal "They
say he has made a translation of Ho
mer's 'Iliad!' What g-g-good is that to
us? All Democrats read llomer in the
original" ,^ Personal^Personal"' 
At this the person to whom the judge
was telling the story  laughed  but tho
judge continuedPersonal "Tli-th-tlint's not tlie
nal joke nt all! The real joke is that
not a in-ui-uinn In the audience so much
as smiled!"
Where She Differed From Pnal
A Scotch clergyman called upon a
parishioner not long since, "an old wom
an who was  not blessed with many
irtues, but who possessed a ery a
ried assortment of ices He took the
latter as a text for a sermon and spoke
to her at considerable length upon tho
subject, concluding with some extracts
from one of St Paul's epistles which
he felt to be apropos
She didn't gpeak for seeral minutes
after be had finished, and he thought
that he bad made an impression upon
her at last He was mistaken, how
eer, for ; she  suddenly turned round
with' the remarkPersonal "Humph! That" s
Just where Paul and I hae differed
these ten years"
The argument was not continued
Man loes to be praised for his Intui
tion, woman for her logic As a rule
neither possesses either— Smart Set

His One Dally Heal
Dr George Fordyce, the  celebrated
anatomist Personal and lecturer, on chemistry,
used to eat one meal a day and' one
meal only, but >it was a ' mighty one,'
washed down with liberal drafts of
wine and beer ; At 4 o'clock eery day
he used to enter a certain' chophouse
and take his seat at a table always re
sered for him A siler tankard con
taining a quart of strong ale, c full
bottle of port and a quarter of a pint of
brandy were placed before him imme
diately - 
Tho moment the waiter announced
the doctor's r arrial the  cook ' put a
pound and a half of rump steak on the
fire, and to' while away the time until
the 'steak should be properly broiled
the waiter brought the doctor some
tempting morsel like a broiled chicken
or a plate of fish When he had eaten
this, Dr Fordyce drank half of his
brandy and then began on his steak
While eating the steak he drank the
tankard of ale aid after that the rest
of tho brandy ' The waiter then un
corked •!;•' 1-nttle of port, nnd the doc
tor proceeded slowly to enjoy it unlil It
was all gone He spent an hour and a
half daily at his one meal and after It
returned home to gie his lectures on
chemistry, which are still quoted as
classics of that science He ate nothing
else uiitil the next day, j when ' he re
turned at the same hour to the same'

The Weight of Ice
The teemin and • the coalman are
often suspected of giing short weights
— mnybe oftener suspected than guilty;
niaj-bo oftener guilty than suspected
The means •of testing the weight of
from ten to thirty  pounds of Ice are
-not always at hand In the house, but a
close estimate of the weight can, be
reached by multiplying together the
length, breadth and thickness of the
block in Inches and diiding the prod
uct by thirty This will gie ery
closely the weight in pounds, j Thus, If
a block of ice Is 10 by 10 by 9, the prod
uct is 000, and this diided by thirty
gies thirty pounds as the correct
weight A block 10 by 10 by G weighs
twenty pounds This simple method
enn be easily applied, aud it may sere
to remoe unjust suspicion or to detect
short weights

She Needed Them
"I wish, John," she said regretfully,
"I had had sense enough not to destroy
all the letters you wrote me during the
year and a half of your courtship"' '
He smiled in a gratified way "1
knew you would regret that some time,"
he said
"Indeed I do," she replied "I need a
little change the worst sort of way,
and the man who buys rags and old pa
per was here today How "wasteful we
are In our youthl"

Fnrnltnre Polish
A recipe for a" ery superior furni
ture polish gien by a dealer in musical
Instruments to a housewife as the
cause for the shining surfaces of the
pianos In his rooms consists of four
tablespoonfuls of sweet oil, four table
spoonfuls of turpentine, a teaspoonful
of lemon juice and ten drops of house
hold ammonia • This polish must be
thoroughly shaken before using and ap
plied with an old flannel or silk cloth
Rub briskly and thoroughly, which is
at least a third of the merit of all pol
ishes Use a second cloth to rub the
mixture Into the grain of the wood and
a third for the final polish -
Eating a Pineapple
A Florida fruit grower states that the
naties of the pineapple district neer
think of cutting a pineapple across
They pare it, cut it lengthwise, slice It
or not, and, with the trlmm4d crown as
a handle, eat It much as a New Eng
lander does his green corn, rejecting
the core This, th» writer states, not
only improes the flaor, but lessens
the strings of fiber that get In the

An American - capitalist ' who has
made a fortune running far Into the
millions likes to tell a story of his first
business enture and how he saddened
the local grocer At this time he was
fond of frequenting a public salesroom
near his home where all sorts of bar
gains were offeredPersonal *~  '
Personal One day l noticed seeral boxes of
soap of a certain brand which I had
if ten been sent to buy at the corner
grocery I thought to myself, "That
will go cheap," so I ran to the grocery
and receied a promise from the man
In charge to buy as much of the soap
at a certain figure as I could furnish
Of course  he neer suspected that t
could furnish any of it - ' •
I returned to  the salesroom, and
when the soap was put tip I bid It In,
and It was knocked down to me My
name was demanded, and when I gae
It in a shrill oice eerybody laughed,
for I was then only eleen years or
age  ;
Amused as they were at the sale, the
bystanders were amazed when I bid In
the whole lot of twenty-two boxes I
had them carried oer to the grocery
and receied - the price 'agreed upon
The grocer wore a weary look when he
heard  how j I had obtained the soap
He saidPersonal -
"Well, I guess I could hae done that
myself"Personal
I replied that I guessed he could, too,
but he hadn't— Youth's Companion  '
Han Wto Named America
Few Americans are aware of the fact
that the name of their continent is due
to a German scholar In 1507 Martin
Waldseemuller, also known as  Hyla
eomylus, of St Die, In the Vosges,
edited a book called "Cosmographite
Introdnctlo," In which he gae a trans
lation of Amerigo Vespucci's descrip
tion of his oyages
That was just the time when Ameri
go's fame filled the world, while Colum
bus' disgrace oershadowed his merit,
and eidently his name  had 'Personal neer
reached the quiet illage in the Vosges
when Amerigo trumpeted forth his own
glory So Hylacomylus proposed that,
since the new continent was, after all
not a part of the Indies, no name would
suit it better than that of his famous
explorer, Amerigo ,
The book was read far and wide, and
so quickly was the proposition accepted
that, when later on the true discoerer
was i known, the name was already
rooted too  deeply in general use to
be abolished, and was een extended
to the north part of the continent, while
Hylacomylus had only meant It for
the present South America,— National

For Tired Sixes
j Eyes will be greatly strengthened by
putting the face down Into a glass or
eyecup of water the first thing in the
morning and opening them under wa

at first, but If the water for two or
three days be tepid and gradually made
colder by Imperceptible degrees until
it ls no shock to put the face into quite
cold water It will Boon become' quite
easy and is ery Inigorating and re
