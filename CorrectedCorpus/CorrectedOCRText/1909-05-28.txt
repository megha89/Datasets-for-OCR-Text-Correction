THE TWO HORSE BRAND || \
DEFAULTER OF OVER $6000
Cltas. 11. Turner, Grand Secretary
of N. S. G. W.,' Short to That Ex
tent.
Chns. 11. Turner, graud Bearetnry
of JNutive sons, tins been fonnd ebort
in bis account lo the liuin of over
?(i(MH). An expert examination of bis
books fliovva this defalcation during
tlm iinst year. It Is supposed tbat
the beginning of th.a leakage dates
further baok. Ho has held tbe olllco
nf graud treasurer for six yours and
was n candidate for reelection before
the lost grand purlor which wns bold
In Maryßvillo last mouUi. Charges
were preferred agaiust him at Unit
time. Nothing definite was dovelop
ed, but a certain suspicions entry in
bis accounts led to the belief tbat
something was wrong. When bis
successor Fred U. Juug, was elected,
an expert examination was started,
and soon disclosed tbat a systom of
embezzlement bad linen going on, tbe
leakage beiug 86000 during tbe one
year. lurner passed his early years
in Jackson. Here be was schooled
and lived during the years of bis
minority. . Here he was married.
Many years ago tbe family removed
to San Francisco, where be has most-
Iv resided over since. His wife ia a
sister of A. Cnmiuetti of this county.
Hia friends nud Tolativcs keenly feel
the blow resulting from bis dishonest
actions. - The Call of tbo 26th says of
this attair:
The discovery was made yesterday
by grand trustee Liouis li. Mooser
and an expert accountant delegated
by tbe grand parlor to examine '.tur
ner's books. Tbe National surety
company, which was on Turner's
bonds during bis inoumbency, was
notified of tbe defalcations yesterday,
and today criminal proceedings will
be taken against the former official.
Irregularities were discovered" in
Tinner's books during the week prior
to the meeting ot tbe grand parlor' at
Marysville, but the dlsoovery waa not
complete and as it then appeared
from a cursory examination of the
books that Turner bad made good bis
peculation tbe grand officers com
promised with tbe man, telling him
tbat if be would not run for re-elec
tion bis conduct would not he
exposed.
After tbe grand parlor bas adjourn
ed a more extensive examination was
made of Turner's books, with tbe
result tbat it was found that be bad
misappropriated more than 30,000
during the last year. Of 'this sum
83,400 waa taken from tbe per capita
tax fund of tbe order and tbe balance
from returns on supplies sold by tbe
grand parlor to tbe subordinate par
lors.
Jt is said tbat Turner bas admitted
liia thefts to tbe otHoers of tbe grand
parlor, explaining tbat be bad no
system of stealing, "but tbat be took
tbe money when be needed it."
' Turner shortly betore bad changed
the system of booking in the oflloe.
A new sot of books had been started
and arbitrary balancea established.
On Friday, April 23, there was a
meeting nf tbe grand officers held in
tbo local headquarters of tbe order in
tlio Uelbert bunding, Van Ness
areuue and U'Farrell street.
Tbe grand officers asked Mooser at
tbat time tor bis report ou tbe
finances of the order. Mooser replied
tbat tie could not aooept the books as
tboy stood, owing to tbe recent
change in bookkeeping. lie added
tbat in tbe books aa they stood be
bad found that during tbe months of
April and May, 1008, Turner bad
turned in 11,000, wbiob was not
charged to any fund. Tbat seemed a
susplolous entry.
Turner admitted, it is stated, tbat
be bad borrowed 31,000 from tbo
funds of tbe order aud had paid the
sum buck in tbat crude aud unwieldy
way.
Immediately, when tbat breaob of
faith was made known, tbe grand
