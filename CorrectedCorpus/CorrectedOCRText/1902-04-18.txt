THE ROA TO YSPEPSIA
Why So Many Persons Suffer From
Thla istressing- Trouble
It requires about fie hours for the
stomach to work on an ordinary meal
and pass it out of itself, when it falls
into a state of repose; hence If a man
eats three times a day his  stomach
must i work j fifteen hours 'out jof ; the
twenty-f^ourM After & night's sleep we
wake up with a certain amount of bod
ily igor which Is faithfully portioned
out to eery muscle of the system and
eery set of muscles, each its rightful
share, the stomach among others
When the external body gets weary
after a long day's work, the stomach
bears Its share of the fatigue) but If,
when the body Is weary with the day's
toil, we put it to bed, giing the atom-,
ach meanwhile a fie hours' task which
must be performed, ;we impose upon
the erybes&friend WB t ha"ej-tho one
that gies us one of 'the largest amounts
of earthly enjoyment— and if this oer
taxing Is continued It must as certain
ly wear out prematurely as the body
itself will if it is oerworked eery
day
And, ' if  persons ' eat between meals,
then the  stomach has ! np rest from
breakfast In th,e morning until 1, 2,' 3
or 4 o'clock next day; hence it is that

Fatten I nar For Murrlmtt
The marriageable girl in Tunis has a
trying ordeal to go through after her
betrothal to the man not of her choice,
but whose choice she Is She has to be
fattened to the required size-before the
ceremony can take place ' ; -•-•
As soon as the'betrothal takes place
she is taken to a room and there coop
ed up till the fattening process is con
cluded Siler shackles are fastened
round her wrists and ankles, and the
task of her parents and future hus
band is to increase her bulk till her
wrists and ankles fill up the shackles
If the husband is a widower or has
"discharged" his first wife, the girl has
the shackles of the first spouse placed
on her, and she must fill them out
It takes a long time to do this, as a
rule, 1 and sometimes it cannot be ac
complished In spite of all efforts It is
then open to the future husband to cry
off the bargain or waie the' condition
In the case of a bachelor he takes care
to see that the bracelets and anklets
are not too large— that is, if he is fond
of the girl— but If he is being forced
into the marriage by his parents he is
a great stickler for custom Stout girls

SENSITIVE TO SOUN
ACUTE POWERS OF HEARING WITH
WHICH FISH ARE ENOWE \
  1
Some Interesting Experiments That
Were Made to etermine last What
Manner of Noises or Motions Would
Startle Trout, - '
„ There are  three -'phases of sense in
fisUi particularly, interesting to the an
gler—their exquisite powers of hearing,
of seeing and their subtle, abnormal
sensitieness to atmospheric influence
With all our experience and study it is
doubtful if we hae arried at any
thing like a full estimate of the acute
sensitieness with which fish are' en
dowed I deote this article to hear
ing Br hearing I must obiously be
understood to meap their power of ap
preciating the ibration caused by
sound, the conductor being either solid,
aerial or liquid
In nian sound detonates the eardrum,
and in that way when we are under
water we discoer little intelligible
meaning from sounds But the same
ibrations are undoubtedly receied by
the exquisitely sensitie hearing Intel
ligence of a fish, if I may use the
term, ( in a different and far more im
pressie wa j*- " By intelligence jI j mean
an instinctie* recognition by their
bodies of some disturbance, just as
man recognizes a passing breath of ah*
It takes the form of feeling
I came to the conclusion that I
would make a few experiments Here
are one or two factsPersonal A friend entered
into it with me, and we bethought our
seles of certain well known trout in
our presere which were "always
there" Then we placed thatched hur
dles a day or two beforehand so that
the fish might get accustomed to them
in such a way that we could approach
close to their haunts without being
seen and watch the unsuspecting trout
through a small hole cut in the straw
When one was not at borne, the other
generally was My friend undertook
the noise making, I the obseration
From the sound of a gunshot 500
yards away,' which made our trout dis
tinctly start, to the breaking of a twig
three yards from the fish, which did
the same, we tried all kinds of sounds,
shrill and dull and at arying dis
tances, and the sum of our experiments
coninced us of thisPersonal That our sensi
tiely organized friends felt the dis
placements of molecules through ether,
which we call sound, and the further
ibrating disturbance through what we
call water, which I erily beliee con
ducts sensation to the fish as readily
as glass permits the penetration of
light to' this paper, in proportion to the
distances and the character of the
sound, but that they did hear, or feel
rather, and with incredible quickness,
too, was conclusiely demonstrated
What they heard and were not alarm
ed at I cannot tell, but when they were
alarmed it was eident enough by the
same kind of start they gie when their
chief enemy suddenly peeps oer the
bank In only two cases could I dis
coer actual fright, the fright that
sends them down— a gunshot behind
the hurdle and a heay stamp of the
foot near by It is noteworthy that the
shrill sounds seemed to startle them
most For instance, a policeman's whis
tle at ten yards sent one out into the
stream as if looking about for some
source of danger, whereas a shout at
the same distance caused no detected
moement Their way of shifting a
little farther from the bank when they
hae an inkling of danger is a ery
pretty side moement, well known no
doubt It seems for the purpose of
watching the bank at a better angle
The common manner of showing
their alarm was by a sudden quier,
sometimes followed by a sinking down
an inch or two, as much as to say,
"What's up?" I ery much doubt if I
eer crept up to my peephole without
being detected, and yet I was careful,
for If you notice, a trout once on the
qul ie gies no sign of alarm at a
second moement or noise Once pre
pared he is immoable till he suddenly
darts off You may throw your great
coat at him, and he either braes it stol
idly or bolts cleans away Fie minutes'
perfect stillness and they settle back to
confidence, and then they were again
easily startled I fancy the laws of re
fraction had something to do with It
and that een from the sky they some
times perceied my moements I bad
often suspected this before
I Another conclusionPersonal I beliee they
heard much they appeared not to A
sudden smack of the hands together,
and there was a decided quier, but a
bird rattle, begun ery softly and grad
ually brought up to Its ery loudest,
and no notice seemed to be taken But
doubtless, like ourseles, howeer loud
the noise, the gradient robs it of its
startle Howeer fanciful it may
sound, of this I am thoroughly con
inced — that water is such an immedi
ate transmitter of ibration to fish that
they recognize sound from the air near
ly as quickly as man It Is no argu
ment to say we do not when in it We
hae no need Fish hae And be
cause they haye^they are proidentially
endowed with super sensitieness to that
particular nerous influence among

FLOATING ISLANS
One Island, J Coering Two Aero,
Seen In the GnU Stream
 Of all , passengers | carried'Personal by  ocean
currents floating islands ore thePersonal most
Interesting ' Many of them hae been
found oyaging on the Atlantic These
Islands - were ; originally ' parts of
lying rier banks which broke away
under stress of storm of j flood and
floated ont to'BearThe Orinoco, the
Amazon, the La -Plata and other trop
icPersonal! 1 riers often send forth such pieces
of their, shores  , Some r of the bits of
land are of large size and enrry ani
mals Insects and egetation, een at
times including trees, the roots of
which sere to hold the land Intact,
while their branches and leaes sere
as sails for the wind' Generally the
waes break up these Islands shortly
after they put to sea, but sometimes,'
under faorable conditions, they trael
long distances ', !
The longest oyage of a floating Is
land, according to goernment records,'
took place In 1893 This island was
first seen off Florida, and apparently It
had an area of two acres It bore no
trees, but It was thickly coered with
Imshes and in' one place It was thirty'
feet high aboe the sea leel ' It was
In the gulf stream, traeling slowly
and with occasional undulations to
show where the ground swell was
working beneath It p Probably It got
away from its rier anchorage In the
spring of the year, for toward the lat
ter part of July It had reached the lat
itude of Wilmington, el
No large animal life had been seen
on it, though there must hae been
myriads of the small creeping things
which abound In the tropics ! By the
end of August It had passed Cape Cod
and was eering toward the Grand
banks It followed the steamer lane
routes quite accurately, and seeral
essels reported It One month later
It was in midocean northwest of the
Azores, and its oyage eidently was
beginning to tell on it It was tnm-h
smaller and less compact It was not
seen again, and probably it met de
struction in the October gales But it
had traeled at least 1,000 miles, and
If, as was thought, it came from the
Orinoco, it must hae coered twice
that distance
It Is quite possible that floating is
lands larger than this one under more
faoring circumstances, might during
past ages hae made the complete Jour
ney from America to Europe 6r Africa
and so brought about a distribution of
animal species Of course it Is not ab
solutely certain that this island went
to pieces In October It might though
this is not probable, hae floated down
into the region of calms and seaweed,
where it would be longer presered—

went on the bishop
 "Well, the people are religious That's
what makes me think so"
"What do you call religious? o they

"Some of them do, and some do not"

The Basking; Shark
The ferocity of sharks la not necessa

bo called because of its habit of lying
motionless at the surface of the water
It often attains a length of nearly forty
feet but its teeth are small compara
tiely, and it probably neer attacks
man, depending upon small fishes and
Crustacea for lta diet- Another name
for this species is "sail fish," because
of its great back fin, which shows out
of the water like a sail when it Is
basking
Although sluggish ordinarily and eas
ily harpooned, It exhibits great actiity
and enormous strength when struck,
diing immediately to tbe bottom and
requiring a great length of rope to bold
It These basking sharks are caught
for their liers off the coast of Iceland,
and the oil obtained Is used to adulter

made are nurtured ' and cared for al
most as carefully, as are race horses
Most of them are reared in a mountain

nourished on milk alone and are neer
allowed , to eat Personal grass, as ~that' would

Catted States Bays , Three-fifths of
World's Output
 The world has neer seen and in no
other part of the world is there now to
be seen anything like America's Jewel
madness as shown by the conditions of
today, when more than 300 New York
establishments are engaged solely in
the Importation of precious stones,
when agents of American dealers are
ecarcblng ; Europe for the white gem
and hopelessly endeaoring to 'supply
American appeals for rubies and emer
alds and when 6,000 men in South Af
rica • are toiling to  obtain diamonds,
more than half of which are to add to
the beauty and happiness of the Amer
ican woman   -
It is she that has caused the United
States to become the greatest diamond
market in the world For her we hae
imported in a single year $20,000,000
worth of precious stones, for her at
one period we smuggled them in at the
rate of $7,000,000 a year, for her we
annually buy something like $12,000,-
OOO^worth of diamonds and thus for
her sake heartlessly jj leae of the 1
world's total output of diamonds only
some $8,000,000 worth to satisfy the
anity of all the rest of the women on
earth
For her adornment we annually
cause to be brought to this country
diamonds weighing In the aggregate
1,200 pounds, a weight three times that
of the total output of the famous Kini
berley field and practically the equal of
that of tbe whole of South Africa, the
world's greatest diamond mine— Frank

Fond of Smoking
 Smoking In church Is a utch cus
tom utchmen are such ineterate
smokers that one of them is rarely
seen without his pipe He finds him
self unable to deprie himself of the
Indulgence een for the short period
of a church serice A similar practice
exists in seeral churches in South
America Smoking In churches In Great
Britain is said to hae been prealent
at the end of the sixteenth and the be
ginning of -the seenteenth century
At one time smoking was carried to
such an excess In Seille cathedral that
the chapter applied to the pope for
power to repress the abuse Urban
VIII, yielding to their wish, Issued a
bull, which was promulgated Jan 30,
1642 '
In Wales smoking In church was In
dulged in as late as 1850 In one church
the communion table stood In the aisle,
and the farmers were in the habit of
putting their hats upon it, and when
the serice began they, lighted their
pipes and smoked, without any thought
of irreerence In the act— Youth's

A Way of Cooking Rodents
The negro slaes of Jamaica used to
regard rats as a dainty, their masters
not  proiding them with any other
meat Their method of cooking the
toothsome rodents' was to Impale each
one on a long wooden skewer after
cleaning the animal and cutting off the
tail, turning it briskly around oer a
fire until the hahPersonal was all burned off
Then It was scraped until free from
fur, and finally the end of the skewer
was stuck into the ground, inclined to
ward the fire, until It was toasted dry
and crisp, thus being made ready for
the meal
The Heart
That wonderful piece of mechanism,
the heart appears to work continually
day and night from birth to death, but
in reality there are short pauses or
rests between each beat which, though
minute in themseles, mount up In the
aggregate to eight hours out of eery
twenty-four These short pauses ena
ble the heart to repair the waste which
constant work entails and without
which rests It would break down
Used to Smoke In Church
The Bey r Parr, when perpetual
curate of Hatton, Warwickshire, which
liing he held from 1783 to 1790, regu
larly smoked in the estry while the
congregation were singing long hymns,
chosen for the purpose, immediately be
fore the sermon The doctor was wont
to exclaim, i'My people like long
hymns, but I prefer a long pipe"— All

AN EXPRESS PACKAGE '
Wnhr the Shipper Wonld Not esign
nate Its Value
"What is the alue?"" asked an ex
press agent in "a Broadway office of a
keen eyed customer who had handed
him a package to be sent to a western
city The man addressed did not an
swer at once, but glanced at a printed
card on the wall that reads, "Always
state the alue of your shipment" ,  
"If I state the alue, will your com
pany pay me that amount in case the
package is lost?' asked the man In his
turn
"Certainly not, unless that is proed
to be Its alue," answered the agent
"If I state the alue, can I proe a
greater alue If It Is lost?"   \ ,
"You will hae to ask a lawyer that
question," replied the agent
"That isn't necessary, for I happen to
know the law," said the shipper "Yonr
company is trying to establish an un
fair rule, because M works only one
way You are right when yon say that
my statement cannot bind yon,' for In
case of loss you can proe the alue,
but my statement would bind' me, for
the court would say that I was 'estop
ped' by my declaration as to the clue
'If a shipper should underalue his
shipment, thinking that thereby he
would reduce the charges, he would
hae to stand by his statement and
your notice Is calculated to make him
da that ery thing You can mark my
shipment 'No alue stated,' and then if
we meet In the courts it will be on an

The Miles We Walk
How many miles a man walks In his
lifetime depends naturally upon how
much he walks a day on the aerage,
but the man who walks the least co
ers a ast number of miles before he
dies Some men walk two miles a day,
some four or fie and some as many as
ten If a man walks two miles a day
and lies to be thirty years old, he will
coer 21,000 miles At the same age a
man who walks three miles a day will
hae walked 32,850 miles Almost e
ery man walks between two and three
miles a day  just In going about the
house, the office, the shop, and In going
to and from the cars, etc
A man who walks fie miles a day,
finds that at the age of thirty he 'has
coered 54,750 miles and at the age of
sixty 109,500 From this should, strict
ly speaking, be subtracted the few,
months or a year, when he was a baby,
unable to walk, but the result would
not be affected materially ;
Now, the circumference of the earth
at the equator Is only 24,899 miles, so
therefore a man who at the age of six
ty has aeraged fie miles a day since
he was able to walk has walked
enbugb miles to hae encircled the
earth four times and hae a good
many miles left oer toward the fifth

RAILWAY MAPS
A isgruntled Passenger's Comments
on the Straight Line Variety  '
"Look at that" said an ill natured
passenger, pointing to a large map on*
the wall of the railway station "Isn't
that an abominable fraud?'
"What's the matter with it?" asked 9
his mild companion
"Look how it Is distorted," said the,
other "There is a map of a railway
system from Chicago to New York It
is made to appear as following a'
straight line between these two cities,
and yet on the map It appears to pass
through eery large town within 800
miles of that line
"Just notice that towns like Cincin
nati and Cleeland are so nfisplaced as
to appear only a few miles apart and
Nashille, Term, is pulled 500 miles
from its real location I wonder thejj
hae not transported New Orleans a
thousand miles northeast, so as to
bring it on the line of their railway

fake," he continued, "and punish hea

Births, deaths, marriages, accidents, amuse

tween towns in the coy  need not be men
tioned, but isits from oi >o places beyond the
county may be recorded
The Chinese exclusion bill which
had been framed by the western
senators and representaties and'
passed by the house was defeated in
the senate on the 16th inst', and by
a ote of 48 against 33 the bill of
Plattof Connecticut was substitut
ed When the substitution had
been made it was supported by all
the senators present except Hoar,
and the ote stood 76 to 1 It will
now go to the house as a new bill
originating in the senate There is
little doubt of its passing the house,
and while it may be called a com
promise between the extremesis
pro and con, it is far preferable to
no restriction The Platt measure
proides for the continuation of the
present Geary Act to 1904, and ex
tends the proisions of that law to
all insular territory under the juris
diction of the United States
Up to this time nothing definite
has been reached in the peace nego
tiations existing between the Brit
ish and the Boers The St James
Gazette predicts an early public an
nouncement of the progress of the
peace negotiations The paper says
there is little doubt that if the Brit
ish and Boers arrie at an under
standing on the main points of the
proposal, peace will ensue, the ban
ishment proclamation will be with
drawn, and minor points like re
stocking the farms, will be referred
— to a board composed of British and
Boer representaties It is belieed
that discord exists between the
British cabinet and Lord Milner,
the British High Commissioner in
South Africa, oer the terms for ob
taining peace, proposed by Lord
 Milner There is good reason to be
liee that the Boers are igorously
demanding a representatie goern
ment, which demand is opposed with
equal igor by the British repre
sentaties
Bad Break in the Bitch
Last Friday a break occurred in the
old ditch of the Standard Electric
Company, causing considerable incon
enience and expense The water had
been turned into the Page reseroir,
preparatory to running it into the Ta
beaud lake through the new waste
gate Owing to the location of the
Page reseroir and the character and
formation of the earth and rock in
which it is built, some doubt has ex
isted in the minds of the engineers as
to the ultimate success of confiningPersonal the
water at that place These conditions
howeer could be ascertained only
after the work had been done and the
experiment tried
When the water was first turned in
some trouble was caused, but the dam
age was repaired and a further test
was required Accordingly the gate
aboe was again opened, allowing the
reseroir to fill Friday the hillside
on the south gae way aboe the ditch
which supplies the old plant and the
New York Ranch reseroir, carrying
away the ditch for a distance of four
hundred feet A force of carpenters
were set to work immediately fluming
the break, the work being rushed with
all possible speed, being completed the
following Tuesday In this space of
time the old plant was forced to close,
and the water supply on the Sutter
creek side fell off considerably, causing
one of the mines to prepare for steam
power On Tuesday the -water was
again running in the old ditch as usual
A flume is now being run through the
Page reseroir to the head of the pipe
line, and the company will soon test
the big plant

reel and down skip and men went to
ward the center of the earth at an
alarming rate The men thought they
were "goners" as three hundred feet of
perpendicular space were between them
and the bottom of the shaft To their
good fortune, howeer, the slack of
the cable caught on a set-screw and
stopped the downward moe As it
was they only went down about twenty
feet, but that was enough to gie them
a number of bruises about the arms
and back, besides a bad scare

NOTICE-^ rf 1 
When you are about to buy a suit
of clothes, it would be absurd to go
to a carpenter's shop When, in
need of medicine, you would not, call
on the blacksmith to prescribe for
you To reasonable people it will
appear, that to buy a suit there is
but one place, and that is the tailor
shop, where your suit can be iitted
on you before being made up; and
where you can select your goods,
not from a piece of scrap on paper,
where in nine cases, out of ten when
your suit arries it isn't at all what
you selected If you buy it home
you can select your goods from a
large assortment of piece goods, and
can soe what you are getting for
your money Your ready made
suits are pressed and remodeled with
no e^tra charge; this I guarantee
Remember mine is the only place in
Jackson where you- can hae this
done free of charge" 
Hae just receied a brand new
line of spring and summer goods all
ready made and to be made up to
order Men's, Youth's and child-
ren's clothing of the latest styles
Trusting to receie a call from
you, and thankiug you for your past
faors, and soliciting the same in
the future,

The Economic Gas Engine
E H Schmitz of Sutter Creek, for

power is needed, combined with effic

be only one-third that of gasoline or
electricity or water This fact must
recommend it as worthy of attention
by tljose needing power Crude oil is
the fuel used, and the cheapness , of
this material, as compared with other
fuel, explains the immense difference
in running expenses Mr Schmitz has
only taken hold of the matter a few
days, and is meeting with substantial
encouragement, as the merits of this
engine is explained We are informed
that the county rock breaker, which
takes at least $3 worth of gasoline per
day to operate it for eight hours, could
be operated by this engine at less than
51 50 ' Eery person using power
should look into this oil usiqg engine

A MOST ARING HOL-UP
Lone Bobber Holds Up Pic-
cardo's Saloon
Gets Only $25 in Cash— A Couple of
Shots Fired at Intruder, Who
is Certainly Wounded 
One of the most, daring attempts in
the highwayman line that has occurred
In this county for many years, took
place Friday eening of last week at
PiiPersonalcardo's Baloon, on the road to Jack
son Gate It was in the early part of
the eening, shortly after 8 o'clock
The saloon was filled with people; at
least 8 persons were congregated there
At the hour named a medium sized
man stepped into the room at a brisk
walk, haing a black cloth masking
his face, and- wearing a long linen
duster He walked lnt» the middle of
the saloon, holding an ugly looking
pistol in his hand, and haing a spare
gun sticking out from a belt that
girdled his waist It was eident that
he was a road agent that meant busi
ness Ho coered A Piccardo with his
gun, and kept his eye on Louis Pic
cardo, and commanded them in em
phatic language to throw up their
hands, which of course they, all did
He then commanded all except Piccardo
and his son, to get into the cellar, or
room behind the saloon One of the
company was a new comer from Sunny
Italy, and was not sufficiently posted
in English to understand his command
He therefore, unwittingly hesitated,
when the intruder gae him a kick,
which had the effect of hurrying his
exit Tho stranger next ordered Pic
cardo and Louie in the office, and when
there he told them to "open the safe,
and be quick about it" The safe
was not locked So the front door was
thrown open, but the inside portion
was locked, and Piccardo was in no
hurry to find the keys The' robber
was nerous at the delay He ordered
Piccardo to hand oer the cash he had
about him, also the contents of the till;
altogether he corralled about $25, and
thereupon turned to leae the place
Now Louie Piccardo kept a shotgun
in the corner of the office It was not
in iew of the robber as he stood at the
office door, and he was eidently
ignorant of its presence there It was
not loaded, but there were a number of
loaded shells close by, loaded with No
6 bird shot Louie seized the gun as
soon as the man's back was turned ,
and slipped a couple ot shells In, and as
the robber had just got to the front
door, about 40 feet away, fired both
barrels in quick succession The free
booter fell just as he got through the
door He got up instantly, howeer,
and made his escape A pistol—be
lieed to be the one he carried in his
belt — was picked up, where he fell
Also an old black felt hat, with the
lining all torn out, was found about one
hundred feet from the front door, on
the road toward Jackson Gate A
man who lies just beyond Piccardo's,
and who keeps an electric light in
front of his premises, says he saw a
man examining himself by means of
the light It was no doubt the robber,
trying to size up his damage
The shots shattered the lower pane
of glass in each door Shot marks are
isible from below the glass to the top
of the doors How the shot came to
scatter so widely in so short a distance,
is explained by some on the theory that
some of the shot struck the pistol the
man held in his hand, and deflected,
some upward and some downward, ac
cording to the upper or lower part of
the barrel strucs From this it la in
ferred that the bandit did not escape
without carrying some small shot with
him Indeed, it was utterly impossible
for him to hae escaped being hit if he
was in the doorway when the shots
were fired No blood, howeer, could
be found anywhere If struck at all,
it was in the lower part of the body,
and might not interfere with his flight
The officers were promptly notified,
and started out to hunt up clews
The search was continued through
the night, all day Saturday, and ' Sat
urday night, but nothing of importance
was found On Sunday a linen duster,
ragged and torn, with a hole shot
through the left side of it, made by the
discharge of a shotgun, a belt and pis
tol holster, also riddled by fine shot,
and a large pistol were found hidden in
the skip at the Bellwether mine Con
siderable blood ' stains were found on
the duster, indicating that the robber
was pretty badly wounded The
search was continued with renewed
igor, but up to this time nothing of
importance has been found The man
seems to hae disappeared as mysteri
ously as he came, i

time to tell Sunday eening a swarm
of bees lit on a tree opposite Casslnelli'a
fruit store Jack procured a box and
an old broom, and endeaored to sur
round and herd them into it, but his

fact that many of the bees introduced
their warm end to Jack's anatomy,
with the result that he retreated  and

like it had been bit with a sledge ham

With the light of heaen thereon;
And the dear little hands, like rose leaes

Nome and Its Concomitants
It is natural for human beings when
hearing of some place they hae not
seen to draw a mental picture of it, and
people it according to its note The
farther it is away, the greater the
place grows in mental importance
Sometimes they see it raising its walls
in stupendous grandeur, and then they
paint in gorgeous colors and people it
with figures, and een raise it into god
heads surpassing in conception features
in both man and mansion,' unique, curi
ous, grotesque, and fanciful Had the
excaation of Pompeii and Herculan
eum begun in the year following that
of 79, passing into that century the
matter deeloped would hae hardly
excited curiosity, but as it has lain
silent and still for a little more than
eighteen hundred years its interest in
creased in proportion with the decay
ing centuries, and has become' the fic
tion of fact and the curio of fanciful
expectation Man's mind is prone to
grasp, bold, and shelter theories mold
ed into fancies so extraagant and
erroneous as to create a glamoring im
pression in the human j mind, carrying
it away in ecstasy of fictitious delight,
but- when the real comes, which' it
often does, how strange the difference
The place that sprang into being
through the conception of the ideal
crumbles from stupendous grandeur
and drops with a crash into the ruins
of commonalty - *- V '
The gorgeous picture they hae
drawn in their mental ision fades like
a glamoring shadow away Upon this
mental theordrical hypothesis, mental
pictures of land of the midnight sun
becomes erroneous, extraagant, ridic
ulous, and imperfect To know is to
see, to see is to illustrate, then all
guess work passes into shadowy realms
of its own, and certainty stands' eman
cipated as a fact before you Nome
then, to those far off, is the ideal
Golconda of wealth and magnificence,
but when you stand in the streets of
the city itself the fairy picture you
hae molded in your Imagination be
comes a accum of incongruity and
stands haggard and j grotesque ' before
you The place you see is cosmopoli
tan, for eery shade of humanity is
represented therein The latin race,
dark and sinuey, permeates this mass
of aried humanity The Scandinai
ans find a habitation similar to that of
their own The Laplander habited in
their pinkish blouse coming only to
their knees, below which is a skin
tight arctic stocking, Liliputan in
stature, and wearing a jaunty red cap,
make them the target of jest and the
cynosure of all eyes As they go along
the streets carrying a great load upon
their backs, supported by a head strap,
and bending under the weight, a curi
ous crowd gaze at them with all the
curiosity of a person iewing mon
strosities of a passing menagerie The
Esquimaux is so common on the streets
that they fail to attract attention
They end their merchandise along the
city thoroughfare, and go with a swag
gering, unconcerned gait, and with
that nonchalance of all curiosity as if
they had lied a lifetime amid the curi
ous charms of ciilization Their type
in facial mold Is Japanese, and when
they dress In American fashion, as they
sometimes do, so similar would they
appear that you would not know with
out being told but what it were a Jap
anese standing or walking before  you
Like the reindeer they are gregarous
in character In summer they lie
under their inerted walros skin beats
that carry them from place to place on
the sea, and shelter them from the fall
ing rain upon the land In winter they
lie In engloos, ] which are excaated
houses, with entrances enclosed almost
hermetrically, shutting out the cold
winds that sweep from the Arctic sea
with penetrating deadly ' force Com
ing from their engloos habited in furs
when the thermometer is 50 or 60
below zero, they go in search of the
walros, and when they return they
die again into their abode, leaing
the icy wind that has fanned them for
hours and the sudden change, too often
produce pulmonary diseases, destruc;
tion and death So rapidly is death
following their footsteps that a decade
or two more will mark them' with the
last of the Mohegans
Nome supports no superb buildings
From the ordinary building it drops
into shacks, and ends in canas tents
So deep is the mud in places that it
renders disgust, and merges on to the
ridiculous In passing along the
streets— if I am permitted to use a
misnomer — back from Stedman Aenue
I came upon a new wagon almost out of
sight in mud,' four or fie inches of the
upper portion of the wheels projected
A play card fluttered aboe it, held by
a twine string, and reading, "Claim
this wagon by right of discoery"
Only when the winter winds sweep
with icy breath, bringing the ice and
freezing the surface of the ground, is
Nome in all its glory Then pedes
trians with bradded boots or shoes go
in safety eerywhere, without danger
of dropping to their waist in mud
Nome sports a railroad of the reduced
pattern It is known as the Wild
Goose railroad and runs from the Spit
on the west side of Snake rier to
claim No 7on Anil creek Passenger
rates are $1, and freight $40 per ton
Financially it is a success, but in com
parison of railroads in general, it
dwindles into utter insignificance
When I first saw it, it made me think
of an incident of trael in 1875 I was
on the southbound train going to Los
Angeles There were no sleepers on
the train and passengers could either
stay awake or sleep as best they could
It was 12 o'clock at night, and I was
dozing in my seat I was suddenly
awakened by the hoarse oice of the
conductor sayingPersonal "If you want to go
to Los Angeles stay on this train, that
horse car there goes to Visalia" I
looked up and saw an old man and
woman standing beside the conductor
abashed and disappointed We were
at Goshen junction, and I smiled as I
looked at the small pattern of an en
gine and passenger car standing on the
Vlsalla track It was so small as It
stood beside our panting monster that
for an Instant I imagined it an infant
Quadruped following its mother Such
then is the Wild Goose railroad
Nome Ideal is a dog I *aw the I
honest thtwsrH
;, You can gn mote wear out oT\ei
St ru w & Co's copper ttrtd
oymlb than any other brand
Wild Goose engine stopped in order to j
drie some dogs from the track A
dog Is rated at from $75 to $125 A ;
Mrs Phillips was raising six young
puppies One day when feeding them I
she said to mePersonal "This is my pin money
At 9 months old I'll get $60 apiece for;
these pups" That beats chicken rais
ing in comparison of profits ' So my
lady friends of California will be
obliged to doff their hats to the women
of Nome Lawyers are thicker than l?
priests in Rome There are close to a
hundred of them I heard it stated
that oer one hundred saloons were in'
Nome Among ' the greater are the
Hub, Second Class, Hunter, Waldrof,
El orado, and Madden House Last
summer Main street was planked, '
which made a decided improement
thereon To see is to know, and the
ideal of Nome is before you

HE WAS EXCUSE
But the Talesman Bungled His Ex-
cuse For Eading Jury uly
A young man whose features and
flashing eyes betokened great earnest
ness was summoned before a judge of
the city court the other day for jury
duty He immediately asked to be ex
cused When the ' Judge asked, him
what excuse he had for not sering, he
repliedPersonal , a
 "I beliee it Is a rule of the court
that the jury Is the sole Judge of the
facts and the court of the law— that
the juror should only weigh the facts
as presented by the eidence, not tak
ing into consideration any of the rules
of law goerning the case,- wherefore
all lawyers are exempt from jury
duty"
"But are you a lawyer?" asked the
judge-
"No, but I hae been a close student
of the law for many years"
"I am afraid that I cannot excuse

"Now doctor," said the woman,  '*I

Fresh 'Water Sponges
 That certain sponges can do a great
deal of hnnn Is now maintained by a
French scientist According to him, the
water supply of some cities and towns
has been polluted by them, and the wa
ter supply of others may be polluted if
steps are not taken to preent it 
 Sponges of this kind are found only
in fresh water and are known as "cor
nacuspongice" A close examination
shows that each of the  arious parts
of such a sponge is composed of three
layers First, there is a flattened layer
of epithelial cells, which coers the
outer surface; next, there Is a digestie
layer of cells,; each of which\is sur
rounded by a collar, , from which pro
jects a little thong or whip, and, finally,
between these two there is a third lay
er, containing the reproductie cells as
well as the spicules and fibers which
form the skeleton ' '' •'
In some sponges the spicnles are com
posed of silica and in others of calcium
carbonate ,"   •;  • • fc 
After some time sponges of this type
decay, and If the water Inhabited by
them is used for- drinking purposes the
pollution caused by them is likely, ac
cording to the French scientist; to
proe | injurious to the public health,
and therefore he recommends that the
water be cleared of such sponges wher
eer it is possible to do so
i There ' are sponges of this kind in
many riers and ponds in this country*
Mosart and Beethoen
The stories of how men of genius
hae had future fame predicted for
them in their early youth must gener
ally be taken with a considerable grain
of salt As authentic as most is the
account of the first meeting of Mozart
with the young Beethoen, which took
place on the letter's first isit to Vien
na in the year 1787 Mozart, then at
the height of his fame, asked him to
play, but, thinking his performance
a prepared piece, paid little attention
to it Beethoen, seeing this, entreated
Mozart to gie him a subject, which he
did, and the boy, getting excited with
the occasion, played so finely that the
composer of "on Gioanni," stepping
softly into the next room, said to his
friends therePersonal "Pay 'attention to him

The Scorpion's Wonderful Ear
I hae studied the habits of the scor
pion for many years and hae often
noticed how ery sensitie scorpions
arc to the most delicate sound, musical
or otherwise Under the thorax the
scorpion has two comblike  append
ages, which are the antennas (pecti
natK) It is pretty well settled by
physiologists and entomologists that in
Insects the antenna? represent the or
gans of hearing These delicate struc
tures are easily affected by the ibra
tions of sound, and there can be no
doubt whateer that they, are also af
fected by sounds quite inaudible to the
human ear ' ' ' ,
z The slightest ibration of the atmos
phere from any cause whateer at once
puts in motion the delicate structures
which compose* the antennae, to which
organs Insects  owe the power' of pro
tecting themseles against danger as
well as the means of recognising the
approach of one another— London

Horseshoe Nail Rings
Finger rings made of horseshoe nails!
They are certainly not pretty or grace

To be a genuine charm the ring must
be made from a nail taken from a
horseshoe found by the owner herself
and nobody else \ This Is taken to a
Jeweler, who bends it to fit her little
finger and cuts off the superfluous
length ' ' •
I The ring is not welded together, and
the head of the nail stands for the set
ting There's no way of proing it, but
those who hae adopted these orna

luck as a horseshoe itself hung oer the
door with ends up— New York Herald
