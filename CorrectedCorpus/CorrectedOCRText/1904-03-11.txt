THE; ABUSE OYSTER

The oyster In his glory is a rich, dark
colored, shapely inhabitant of salt wa

and_ has a delicious, Incomparable shlty
flaor which nobody who really, knows
him and has the taste  to appreciate
him would eer dream of spoiling with
crude condiments ''•' But rarely will the
oysterman send such an exquisite crea
ture to market'; It is "not fat enough or
white enough for the ulgar crowd So
he puts it in fresh, or nearly fresh, wa
ter to "fatten"— that is, he draws off
the fine natural Juices by a process of
osmosis* I and  substitutes therefor a
quantity of "water 'which distends'" it
like Personala " balloon and ' makes ' it  Just as
tasteless But it looks fat ' like a
scrawny Christmas turkey Judiciously

A RINK OF WATER
Why It Is a Gootl Plan to Take One
Before renkfitNt
In the morning the stomach contains
a  considerable Personal quantity of  mucus,
spread oer and adherent to its walls
If food enters at this time the tena
cious mucus will interfere to some ex
tent with the Personal direct contact between
the food and the stomach necessary to
prooke the secretion of gastric Juice
A" glass of water taken before break
fast passes through the stomach into
the small intestines ' In a continuous
and ' uninterrupted flow If partially
distends the stomach; it ; thins and
washes out most of tho tenacious mu
cusit increases the fullness of the
capillaries of the stomach directly if
the" water is warm andtndirectly in n
reactionary way if lt Is cold Cm re
must be taken not to take cold water
when the circulation,  either local or
general, ?is so feeble as to make re
action Improbable We should'nbt risk
lt In an adanced age nor in the feeble,
whether old or young, nor should it be
taken in local troubles 7 like gastric
catarrh In these cases lt is best to
gie warm or hot water The addition

was the kubya Kubya means a small

Columbus and the Gulf Stream
I It Is curious to note in tho history
of the gulf stream how great Its influ

new world Before  the discoery of
America strange woodsPersonal and ' fruits
were frequently found on the shores of
Europe and off lying Islands Some of
these were seen and examined by Co
lumbus, and to his thoughtful mind
they 'were confirming eidence of the
fact that strange lands were not far
to the westward These woods were
carried by the gulf stream and by the
preailing winds from the American
continent, so that in part the gulf
stream is responsible for the discoery

I Commonly, the first symptom of a "cold "
is a chilly feeling, accompanied by sneez

frequent of external causes are draughts,
wet or cold feet, or going from hot rooms
suddenly into cold ones More frequently
there is an inner cause — namely the stagna
tion of the blood caused by constipation or
biliousness Almost the first symptom is
the feeling of cold in the feet and increased
discharge from the nose'

mpoerished blood and exhaustion of nere
force Personal Tonics consisting of large portions
of alcohol, iron or cod lier oil do not bring
the desired changes in the blood, because
they do not enter the system and are not
absorbed into the blood, with the exception
of the alcohol, which shriels up the red
blood corpuscles when it does come in
contact with them We recommend the
botanical extract of r Fierce because it
contains no alcohol, and offers a reasonable
and scientific method of treating the blood,

AMERICAN SYMPATHY WITH
JAPAN
; There is a small minority of
American citizens whose sympathies
are with Russia in the war now being
waged between that country ; and
Japan This leaning occasionally
finds expression in the  press, al
though it is undoubtedly true that
ninetenths of the American people
are with Japan We are told by the
proRussiau element that the United
States owes a debt of gratitude to
Russia because of the friendly atti
tude of that goernment in our great
ciil war In' that desperate  strug
gle for national unity, Russia was
almost alone among the nations of
Europe in wishing for' the ultimate
success of the federal cause It may
be that selfish interests more or less
influenced the Russian people in this
direction— the fact that other
powers which stood in the way; of
Russian aggressions were leaning to
the southern side of the controersy
Be this as it may, it is beyond denial
that Russia was prepared in case of
international complications to rally
to the support of the United 'States
at tjhat time The American people
were appreciatie of this moral sup
port at the time, and hae not for
gotten it up to ' the present time
But we fail to see in this any reason
why the ' sympathy of America
should go ont toward Russia in the
imbroglio which is now being fought
out in the far east It does not fol
low that we must support Russia hi
eery moe that restless power, may
make in its insatiable greed for
territory'; Let those who, beliee
that Russia has right on her side in
the present war justify her if they
can Personal But certainly it is un reason 
able for this class to preach to those
who deem her course in the far east
nothing less than a bold attempt at
the' robbery of other nations, that
they ought to applaud the larceny
because of Russia's stand toward
America forty years ago The truth
is Russia is, and has been for the last
hundred years or more, the most
grasping, insatiable power in the
world Her greed for, expansion of
territory is in the nature of a mania
It does not arise from the necessity
imposed by oerpopulation, because
her territory both in Europe and
Asia is the most sparsely settled
portion of the ciilized world, and
will remain so probably for the next
hundred years But the greed for
land afflicts the ; goerning  class
The more she adds to her national
domain, the greater her thirsts for
further acquisition By diplomatic
'cunning, by all the artifices of de
ception and chicanery, she has pur
sued the een tenor of her way in
making additions to her real estate
at the expense of other \ and weaker
nations And notwithstanding all
her professions of fair treatment to
other jfeople in the way of open
ports and free commerce, it is a fact
thaWhereerthe Russian standard
is unfurled there follows, a studious
and carefully carried out plan to ex
clude foreigners from trade competi
tion^ It is Russian trade for Russian
people, not byPersonal the fostering care of
a protectie tariff, as in the United
States, but rather by a system of
oppression of those who hae been
induced by her to build up industrial
interests' within her borders She
first inites foreign capital to ex
ploit her undeeloped territories,
and when these industries become
fairly established, the foreign arti
sans are slowly displaced byVthc
Russians, and finally the owners are
also displaced in the same way
That is the way her new territories
are Russianized Russia has really
weakened herself by expansion  She
has expanded until the immensity of
her land area — all contiguous terri
tory though it be— is a source of
danger rather than security Japan,
the only progressie Asiatic nation;
is also the only power that has dared
to call her hand for the last fifty
years She does this because she is
coninced, from* the settled policy
which Russia has followed in the
orient so long, that it is imperatie
to call a halt in her career of in
corporating the whole of Asia in her
dominions
In one respect the proceedings of
the board of superisors, which we
present in another column, willbe
perused with more than ordinary in
terest by our readers The Ledger
for years has denounced the practice
which has been followed for years in
Amador county, of the superisors
putting in bills in their own names
forthe road work done in their re
spectie districts, haing the bills
lumped on the minutes, and drawing
the money therefor, the same as their
salary or mileage claims, in their own
names We hae contended ; that
'•  > ' T ! 7\'<Personal;ni '•;;
   •
the practice is contrary to law," and
keeps the taxpayers in the dark as
to how the road funds are expended"
Its tendency is/pernicious|in other
ways ;The k matter; was broucrht^up
before the'last grand jury, arid that
body recommended that the practice
be discontinued [By the proceed
ings this month, it will be noticed
that the superisors are abandoning
this illegal method of putting in road
bllls^r Superisors Burke and  Grillo
put in complete itemized bills, sworn
to by the] parties doing the! work?
thereby complying with the law on
this subject They are the new
superisors, and it may_ be assumed
they were anxious to get away) from
the system from the outset of their
official career '^'ThVold members^ of
the board r are'breaking~away gradu
ally Moore's name no
longer appears In the list'of payees
for road work— In districts one and
two the bills are partly itemized and
partly consolidated claims ' It may
be safely predicted that all bills for
road work will soon be presented
and sworn to by the parties actually
interested "For one man to appear
on the records as drawing hundreds
of dollars for labor in one month, will
awaken as much comment as if the
bills were allowed solely in the name
of the ' superisors as i ' heretofore
The Ledger has persistently kept up
the agitation against an • innoation
of longstanding, and public senti
ment was so thoroughly aroused
against it, that it had to fall
; The supreme court has held that
a county recorder is not entitled to
extra compensation for making an
abstract of ' mortgages, notwith
standing that the statute, says that
the superisors may fix his compen
sation < for such' work' It is held
that the law giing the superisors
such* power is unconstitutional

THE AMAOR LEGERPersonal JACKSON, JCAIiIFORyiA; 'FBIAY^f MARCH 11/90
The Public Graeyard
Jackson is now, ' and ' has been for
many years, particularly unfortunate
in the uncaredfor condition of its pub
lic burying ground The cemetery is
not under the control of an association
or trustees No organization was eer
formed specially to take charge of it
It has simply been filled up with graes
without any regard to arrangement or
order Family plate hae been fenced
off in the same way, the size of ! the
plats In no way being influenced by the
probable needs of the family • The pre
ailing Impression has been that the
'grounds are subject to no particular
authority, other than those who hae
relaties buried tberein; ' that the
owners of family plats hae exclusie
control oer such plats, notwithstand
ing that they hae neer paid for the
ground, and hae no title other than
that acquired by preempting the plats
for Personal burial purpose It has been as
sumed that they hae a right to cut
shade trees, or grant , permission to
others to do so whether for firewood
or other purposes , The patients 'from
the hospital are being buried therein,
and to this cause, more than any other,
is due the present congested state' of
the cemetery There has been no plat
of the graeyard made, and no register
or record of the persons buried therein,
other than the headstones erected  by
the friends 'of the ' decedents " In
perhaps the majority of instances
these headstones, or boards, hae long
since fallen In decay, the inscriptions
entirely obliterated, and the mounds
that once marked the graes hae dis
appeared It Is now impossible to tell
from surface indications where the
ashes of the dead repose, and therefore
in opening a grae nowadays, such is
the oercrowded state of the cemetery,
the chances are strongly in faor of
breaking into an old grae, and dis
turbing, human remains placed there
years ago As a matter of fact, it is
asserted that caskets rest one on top of
another in many cases, either from
oerpopulation of this city of tho dead,
or from lack of knowledge as to prei
ous interments Such a condition of
affairs ought not to be tolerated in any
Christian community It is a reflection
not only upon Jackson, but upon Ama
dor county generally It Is made | a
felony to wantonly disturb the remains
of the dead There is little question
that to knowingly reopen an old grae
for\ the purpose ; of burying another
decedent aboe the remains  already
there is also a iolation of the  law
Oercrowding cannot be pleaded as an
excuse, it might be a mitigation of the
offense If it is oerpopulated to such
an extent that  interments cannot be
made without serious risk of desecrat
ing existing graes, it is the business
of those haing authority oer, the
matter to close it against further bur
ials, and proide a new cemetery
', It has been a moot question, who
has authority oer the Jackson ceme
tery This question was brought to
the front this week The preailing
idea has been that no one in particular
but eeryone in general had authority
in the premises But the thought that
in an" enlightened nation a burying
ground should be left at the mercy of
any one who might see fit to operate
therein, is repugmant to all' our con
ceptions of law and justice'; Happily;
the law is not so defectie Last week
it was discoered that a , number of
trees had been felled within the grae
yard for firewood Some ladies inter
ested themseles in the matter to the
extent of trying to stop it It has de
oled upon the' ladies to collect by
public subscription' for the repair of
the fences, and the payment of water
charges, and it is no more than right if
tho growing trees hae a commercial
alue, they should help to pay the
necessary expenses On Monday the
women ] presented the matter to Personal the
superisors The  members went to
the cemetery to Inestigate the condi
tions therein, but seemed disinclined to
interfere, claiming that it was  not
within their jurisdiction Here was a
pretty dilemma A public graeyard —
more populous than the town of Jack
son itself— without a legal guardian;
an orphaned cemetery as It were! They
were not satisfied ! with this iew, and
looked up the law for themseles The
board of superisors had adjourned jj in
the meantime ; The following sections
of the codes are conclusie of the whole
matterPersonal
The public cemeteries of cities, towns,
illages, or neighborhoods must be in
closed and laid off into lots, and the
general management, conduct, and
regulation of Interments, permits to
inter, or remoe interred bodies, the
disposition of lots and keeping the
same order, is under the jurisdiction
and control of tho cities and towns
owning the same, if incorporated; if
not, then  under the jurisdiction and
control of the Board of Superisors of
the country in which they are situated
Eery person, who mutilates, disin
ters, or  remoes ' from the place of
sepulture the dead body of a human bo
ing without authority of law is guilty of
felony But the proisions of this sec,
tlon do not apply to any person who re
moes the dead body of a relatie or
friend for reinterment 3

i  McCall of lone, who has taken a
leading part in the Introduction of the
traction engine on the lone road, and
also in the lumbering  interest of the
county, is interiewing/the people in
different towns in the interest of a
steam railroad from Sutter hill to the
icinity of the Amador Lumber Com
pany's saw mill on Tiger creek The
proposed road is 25 miles In length, and
the object in iew in its construction is
the supply of the mines of the mother
lode region with fuel, logs and lumber
from the resources of Amador county
As it is now this ast trade, amounting
to oer $100,000 annually, is brought
from outside the county, excepting the
round timbers, and een In this respect
the margin is so narrow that,  as the
timber belt is pressed further up  the
mountains," these also aro likoly in a
short time to be brought fronrthe out
side The effoct / has ' hoan greatly to
the detriment of the eustorn section of
the county, and the eil will doubtless
be intensified with the  lapse of time,
unless something Is done to restore this
important trade to Amador county
In addition to the "timber resources,
there are ast deposits oT marble and
granite along the route of the proposed
railroad  These are now dormant,'
owing to difficulties <of transportation, 
but with cheap and rapid transporta
tion they would proe aluable sources
of wealth The proposition is to build
a narrow gauge line, the rails and roll
Ing stock of which can be' purchased at
a low rate second  hand The cost of
construction is roughly estimated at
$100,000, or $000 per mile With a
subscribed capital of $20,000, it is
thought the balance could, be readily
rajisbd by floating bonds The plan
dojes not include building to lone It
is not designed to antagonize or thwart
that project in any way But it is felt
that to undertake the entire length of
nearly 50 miles, would bo too heay, a
load to carry through Furthermore,
the promoters beliee that the opening
up of the eastern section of the county
is more desirable at present ' than ' the
construction of a road from lone to the
mineral belt There is ] room for a
diersity, of opinion on this point
Howeer, there is no question that the
line proposed would be ery adantag
eous to Amador, county It ought to
be encouraged There is no danger of
the railroad business being oerdone
Vast sums of money are being sent out
of the county Personal for the purchase of sup
plies, which would be spent for wages
and material among our own people if
we had railroad facilities like 'the one
proposed  The Ledger wishes Mr
McCall and his coworkers success in
this "enterprise, belieing that it is big
with promise of prosperity for the
whole county
