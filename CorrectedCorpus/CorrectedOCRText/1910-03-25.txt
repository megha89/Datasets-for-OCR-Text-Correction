Easer's Meaning
Easer is a day of joy for all Chris
ians The resurrecion was he pledge
of he riumph of Chrisianiy I
proes 'ha Chris is God; ha he
whom he Jews crucified was he son
of he mos high ; ha he fire which he
came o cas upon he earh was fire
from heaen ; ha he docrines which
he announced bore upon hem he samp
and seal of diine auhoriy Many a
wonderful miracle had Jesus wrough in
he course of his public minisry
Healing wen ou from he ery hem 'of
his garmen, and his oice had power
oer he deils who had orm2ned he
possessed He had made he blind o
see, and he dumb o speck, nay, he had
broken down he barrier ha sunders
he liing and he dead Bu grea
hough hese miracles were, ye no up
on hese did he choose o es he proof
of his mission He again and again
old he fac ha he would rise from he
dead; snd on his he was conen o
es he asseiion of his diiniy
Here, hen, is he hinge on which
urns he Chrisian's faih; and so rue
o his, ha S Paul does no hesiae
o say, "If Chris be no risen, hen
ain is your faih and ain is our
preaching" Nor is i wonderful ha i
should be so Surely, in he supen
dous fac of he resurrecion from he
dead, all mus recognize he hand of
him who is omnipoen Grea is he
power of mau, wonderful his skill; bu
hey hae heir clearly ascerained
limis Men hae power upon he
earh, and hae used i wih wonderful
resuls; hey hae drawn from naure
her mos cherished secres, and hae
forced he unsable elemens o reeal
he laws by which hey are goerned;
bu one hing man canno do, he canno
lif his head among he grae cloher,
nor bring back he ide of blood o he
pulseless hear Only God can do his
Chris, hen, by raising hiself from he
dead, proed himself God, indicaed
his claim o diiniy, and supplied his
aposles wih a guaranee, which none
migh Quesion, of he ruh of he
message hey announced
 las Jesus has riumphed, "He is
arisen, he is no here"

BILL PSSER
Prisoner Passed Confed
erae Money on His
Vicims
 Braghero, who was arresed In
Sacrameno las Thursday as saed in
he Ledger las week, was brough back
o Jackson by depuy sheriff Connors, on
Saurday, and is now confined in he
couny jail, awaiing furher acion I
appears ha he was handling paper
money issued by he confederae goern
mens in war imes  he same ime
he was engaged in selling los in Sunny
side disric in San Francisco The
paricular offense ha led o his appre
hension was he passing of a con
federae §5 bill upon Louis Galln
New Chicago He ried o work off
some of he same suff on Frank Gaz
zera in Uryown, bu Gazzera was sus
picious From he appearance of he
proffered money in paymen for drinks
he concluded ha i was no accoun, and
old Braghero so, and ha he could hae
he drinks free, bu he would no ake
his paper money I seems he had
quie a sock of he bills He ried he
gams on Cappelini, in New Chicago,
and failed  Jos Poinelli's place on
Suer hill he offered a 820 bill The
proprieor saying he had no change, he
endered a $10 noe of he same sus
picious hue— of a yellowish color This
being declined on he same ground of
lack of change, he produced a $5 bill,
bu Poinelli did no wan any of ha
sor of money
fer he escaped from consable
Tule on Suer hill, while he officer
was enroue win his prisoner o Jackson
o lodge him in jail, he wen o Suer
Creek, and passed he nigh liere a he
house of an Ialian Nex morning he
came on o Jackson and had breakfas,
assing hough his ciy while he
oeffiers were searching for him in he
alley He wen on o Paloma, and
hence o Sacrameno, where he
officers go on his rail and capured
him I appears ha he offense of
passing confederae money did no come
wihin he jurisdicion of he federal
cours The money is no counerfei,
alhough jus as worhless The disric
aorney has been looking ino he
maer, and finds ha s an offense
under he sae law— passing ficiious
money So ha he accused will be
prosecued in he superior cour on a
felony charge
The $5 bill passed on Galls in he
hands of he officers, aJso anoher con
