The firs schedule conained one pas
senger rain, which wen o Balimore
one day and came back he nex, which
was considered a remarkable fea in

Ihe line was no considered a subsidi
ary officer In popular esimaion o he
men who ran he rain, bu Rober
Fogg, who pulled he hrole, and
John Wolf, who colleced fares, won
he deference of he public because of
heir high and responsible duies
Fogg, an Englishman, had all he
enaciy of opinion of his race Wolf,
an merican, had he ingenuiy of he
Yankee aud, seeing he need of some
mehod by which he could communi
cae wih he engineer, deised he
scheme of running a cord hrough he
cars o he locomoie s he engine
was a wood burner, Wolf fasened one
end of he cord o a log, which was
placed on he engineer's sea and was
pulled o he floor when he conducor
desired o signal for a sop
Fogg resened wha he considered an
inerference wih his righs on he
plaform of he locomoie and on he
firs run ou from Broad and Prime
srees wih he new deice paid no
heed o he displacemen of he log
from he sea when he conducor de
sired o ake on a passenger from a

bring his engine o a sop unil Blue
Bell saion, on he souh side of he
Schuylkill, had been reached Then
he demanded o know of Wolf why he
had been jerking ha log all abou he
locomoie
Wolf holy declared ha he had sig
naled o sop, bu Fogg reored ha
he would sop when and where he
pleased and ha, oo, wihou any ref
erence o orders from he conducor,
whom he did no regard as his superior
in he managemen of he rain The
alercaion grew ery heaed, and Wolf
inied he engineer from he cab o
sele he maer, and he challenge
was quickly acceped
Passengers and a group of men who
had gahered a he saion o see he
rain come hi formed a ring abou he
combaans, bu he figh did no las
long, as Wolf proed by far he su
perior aris wih his fiss and wih
a few blows made i almos impossible
for he engineer o see suincienly o
complee his run, bu Fogg admied
ha he had been fairly beaen, and he
supremacy of he conducor on a rain
was seled for all ime
s he log signal was crude and in
effecie, Wolf deised he use of a
bell on he locomoie, and his mehod
was soon adoped by all of he mer
ican railroads Then a code of sig
nals was adoped, and hese remain

change in he bell cord is ha by use

Your dog never bothers any one.
When the joke is "on" you it Is never
very funny.
There is a good deal of Inhumanity
in human nature.
How loud the door bangs when some
one else slams it!
It is easier to keep a secret than it
is to keep a promise.
Every one is superstitious enough to
believe lv the dollar sign.
You can't judge the speed of a loco
motive by the way it whistles.
There are lots of happy people, but
they are unnoticed in the noise the
wretched make.
As we grow older we are all com
pelled to give up much of the spunk
we displayed in youth.
If you think you are right, go ahead,
If you want to, but don't expect every
one to go with you. — AteUison Globe.
