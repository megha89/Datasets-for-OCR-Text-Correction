The nex morning Jack Rowlands

The nex morning Edih and her

words she old him she had "broken"
wih Jack, bu he could learn nohing
furher She was erribly upse and
unhappy,
"O, now much she loed him! How

THE BON REPELING
ORINNCE
The lone Echo says' ha be ordi
nance passed by be superisors, re
pealing subdiision 3 of secion 5 o
Ordinance No 118, relaing o he gi
ing of bonds by hn  engaged in he
sale of liquor, is defecie, and con
flics wih he consiuion n ex
aminaion of be ordinance as prined
is sufficien o show ha his con
enion is probably correc Secion
2 of ricle i of be sae consiu
ion reads as followsPersonal
, ; No law shall be reised
or amended by reference o is ile;
bu in such case he ac reised or
secion amended shall be reenaced
and published a lengh as reised or
amended
 I will no be dispued ha his
proision applies o laws passed by
he superisors, as well as general
'laws passed by he legislaure Now
he ordinance referred o disposes of
he maer in his offhand fashion
The board of superisors of he
oouny of mador, sae of Califor
nia, do ordain as follows Personal
Secion 1 Subdiision 3of secion
5 of ordinance No 118, proiding for
he filing of a bond in be sum of
one housand dollars, in suppor o
a permi being graned o conduc a
saloon for reailing liquor and cigars
in he oouny of mador, sae of
California, passed and approed by
be board of superisors of he coun
y of mador, sae of California, on
he 7h day of June, 190, is hereby
repealed
The whole of secion 5 is no re
enaced nor published a lengh, bu
merely subdiision 3 hereof
The quesion arises if his repeal
ing ordinance is inalid and oid by
reason of his noncompliance wih
he proisions of he organic law,
how will i effec hose persons en
gaged in he liquor business who ac
under is proisions I may be said
ha be ordinance is law unil i
has been declared oherwise by he
oour Bu in be een of a es
case, and be cour holding ha be
ordinance was improperly passed, and
herefore oid, i would simply
reie he subdiision as i sood be
fore; ha is be proision regarding
he $1000 bonds would sill be in
force Would be bondsmen be liable
for he acion of he principal in be
selling of liquor wihin be prescrib
ed limis of he Preson school?
These are quesions ha should be
carefully looked ino, and no doub
will be fully considered before any
decisie sep is aken 
N RGUMENT FOR
INCORPORTION
Las week we called aenion o
he fac ha mador couny, hrough
is board of superisors, had ignored
a reques for a donaion oward he
repair of he cemeery fence, which
inoloses he burying place of he de
cedens from he couny hospial
This acion is so pregnan wih mean
ing o he ciizens of Jackson ha we
hink i no ou of place o discuss
i a greaer lengh We are free o
say ha he urning down of so jus a
reques was perhaps due o prejudice
agains he couny sea, raher han
he resul of deliberaie acion afer
a fair and careful inesigaion of he
meris of he proposiion Whaeer
moie promped hem, we canno
beliee heir repudiaion of he coun
y's dead will be susained by he un
prejudiced ciizen, no maer in wha
par of he couny his lo may be cas
The argumen, if we may dignify i
by ha erm, ha because he hos
pial is locaed a Jackson, s he
duy of Jackson's people, and no of
he people of he enire couny, o
look afer he burial place of he hos
pial's dead, needs no refuaion
I is oo preposerons o require an
answer I would be jus as reason
able o ask Jackson o feed and clohe
and mainain he hospial paiens
during life, as o require ha he
own ake charge of heir remains
afer deah The one duy inoles a
much larger expendiure han he
oher, bu hey boh sand on he same
fooing The auhoriy ha is charged
wih he duy of mainaing he
liing indigens, canno escape he
responsibiliy of proiding and caring
for he place of inermen Bu be
cause he own of Jackson has in a'
grea measure relieed he couny of

n old widow lady, named Mrs Phoebe

ion being a grandson, Cheser Maker,
now seeneen years old This boy's
moher died when he was hree years
of age, ad since ha een be has
made his booie wih bis grandmoher
The boy was educaed here, and did
he work abou he place oo as well
as could be expeoed of one of his
years There is a small orchard con
neced wih he dwelling, and a few
bows were kep, which were dependen
upon he grandson's care Ou a rac
of 160 acres abou balf a mile away,
Mrs Williams raised a few bead of
3ock, eigh or en in he course of
a year, and in his way managed o
9ke ou a lielihood, and wih noh
ing o spare
uring Monday nigh he cows and
cales se up an unusual bellowing,
which was coninued Tuesday morn
ing This awakened a suspicion ha
somehing was amiss The cale
plainly showed ha hey had been
negleced So a boy, Clarence Crail,
was sen o he Williams' place o see
if he old lady was sick, and o ener
he house if necessary The door was
unlocked, and no signs o human life
were isible Timidly he wele
year old boy opened he door, wild was
in he room used as he sleeping apa
nien of Mrs Williams He wen up
o he bed, upon which Mrs Williams
was apparenly reclining  pillow
was oer he face Bu ou reaching
he bed he beheld a grea quaniy of
blood, a he sigh o which he fled
error sricken from he house, and
repored o he neighbors wha be bad
Then all was exciemen in he com
muniy I required lile inesiga
ion o impress he belief ha a foul
iurder had been commied, Mrs
Williams being he icim Reino
iug he pillow from he ace, he wom
an's hroa was cu, no doub us she
lay upon he bed There was no sign
of a siuggle The body was badly
ilecomposed, indicaing ha deah bad
aken place hiry or fory hours be
fore Moreoer he boy Maker was
missing He bad no been seen since
Sunday nigh This deepened he
mysery, as he was looked upon as a
quie inoffensie young man No one
hough ha he as implicaed in
he crime
The officers i Jackson were uoifled
by elephoue, and coroner H libery
sared early Tuesday afernoon o
bold an inques Sheriff Norman and
disric aorney Vieiui lef for
he scene, and also ie fiudico
and Gall o make he posmorem ex
Reaching he bouse of horror, he
officers made a searching examina
ion of he enire premises The cir
cumsances lef no oher conclusion
han ha a errible murder had been
perperaed Een admiing ha
he deah cus migh be selfinfliced,
he oher circumsances proed con
clusiely ha i was no a case of
suicide Bu he possibiliy of he
slashes in he hroa being selfin
fleced is dispued There were hree
disinc ous across he hroa One
reaching from he middle of he
hroa, o he lef ear noher par
allel slash, in he same direcion
Boh cus seered he windpipe and
he arery noher smaller ou, and
of a superficial characer, may hae
been made as he sharp insrumen
was wihdrawn from one of he oher
faal wounds The deceased was
dressed, all he clohing being
complee " excep he shoes and
oerdress The icim ' had ei
denly no reired for he nigh
when he murderous work was
accomplished The pillow placed
oei he face concealed he sabs, l
he opinion of he medical expers,
he knife was probably jabbed ino
he hroa wih some force, and hen
drawn o he lef One of he knife
Jezebel
hruss peneraed o he roos of he
ongue bou all he blood in he
body had passed hrough he
wounds The crimson fluid had
soaked hrough he wo maresses,
and formed a grea pool of coagulaed
blood on he flour under he bed
Thfe wo fron rooms were used as
bedrooms, one occupied by Mrs
Williams and he oher by her grand
son From he room where he body
lay, blood spos on he floor led o
he oher bedroom These are sup
posed o hae dripped from he reek
ing knife or fingers of he assassin
The bedclohing in he boy's room
showed ha i had no been slep in
since made On one aricle of he
bedclohes a blood pach was found
i seemed as if made by he laying of
a knife or oher insrumen hereon
The piece of clohing was cu from
he blanke and presered by he
sheriff as eidence No knife or
bloody insrumen was fqund in he
house or abou he premises This
fac iiself was conclusie proof of
murder,
n inques was held on Tuesday
afernoon The jury brough in a
erdic ha he deceased oame o her
deah from wounds in he hroa, in
fliced by paries unknown
The disappearance of young Maker
is one of he inexplicable circum
sances I seems ha on Saurday
las he wen o lone, and purchased a
pair of shoes for playing baseball
These shoes was of a peculiar make
Only one oher boy in Lanoha Plana
has a like pair Maker is belieed
o hae worn hose shoes when he
lef Qq Sunday morning he wen o
he rier o Hah He reurned abou
noon I ia said ha he fell in he
rier and his clohing was eoakccl In
he afenoon be played baseball wih
some boys, wearing he we clohing
On his reurn home he changed bn
olohes, hanging hem up by he
soo o dry This was done while
he eening meal was preparing
The wo are supposed o hae par
aken of supper Sunday eening
fer ha Maker whs seen in he il
lage in fron of he saloon This was
beween eigh and nine o'cock I
waa cusomary for he old lady o
summon him home by ringing a bell
I was he boy's habi o go o he
illage of an eening, and cha wih
his boy friends The neighbors heard
he bellringing ha nigh abou 9
o'clock Some say jhe was seen alie
abou ha hour  any rae, he
noes of he bell are inerpreed as
proof ha she was alie and well a
ha hour; ha he murder had no
been perperaed when he boy was
las seen in Lancha • Plana The
crime is belieed o hae been com
mied beween 9 and 11 o'clock Sun
day nigh
Fooprins of hese peculiar shoes
worn by Maker were seen along he
Mokelumne rier below Lancha
Plana, a a poin where an iron pipe
line crosses he rier He is sup
posed o hae orossed ino Calaeras
couny oer he pipe abou 11 o'clock
In he pocke of he oeralls of
Maker hung up near he soe was
found a purse conaining he sum of
$975 In he under maress of he
boy's bed was found 65c— a 500 piece,
a dime and a nickel  ren had
been made in he icking I seemed
like an old ear or ren I is sur
mised ha his place was where he
old lady or he boy kep ruouey
Wheher robbery waa he moie of
he murder, can only be cojecured
I was repored ha Mrs Williams
was in lone in pril las, and sold
some cale This, howeer, was no
so I has since been learned ha
she sold wo head of cale o he
buchers i Camp Seco, and was paid
$10 on accoun, he bucher owing
$15 sill on he ransacion One
opinion preails ha he old lady
had money, alhough here seems
lile foundaion for his belief I
is srange, if robbery was he in
cenie, ha he Cj cens should
hae been lef, and he money in
he boy's oeralls
I is known ha he grandmoher
and grandson had lile spas, no
iolen quarrels I is said he old
lady had made a deed coneying all
her real esae o Cheser; i was
placed in he hands of a hird pary,
who now holds i She chided he
boy u imes or no looking aer he
place beer Sill he was regarded
by hose who knew him bes as a
good, inoffensie boy; ha he
grandparen was inclined o be oo
exacing, and ha in fac he child
did beer han he aerage boy of his
years
There are wo heories of he crime
One, ha he deed was he work of
ousiders; ha gain was he promp
ing moie; ha he murderers made
away wih he boy, afer aking him
away from he house This belief has
many supporers in he iciniy of he
homicide Lanoha Plana people scou
he noion of he boy being he slayer
Sill here is no he slighes ei
dence cf search for plunder haing
been made Nohing was disurbed
Furhermore, he hamle is off he
rack of rael; ramps are rarely
seen, and srangers enering he place
could hardly aoid being noiced
The oher heory, adhered o by nou^
residens, poins o he grandson as
he criminal; ha i was done in a
momen of anger, following harsh
words beween he wo 
Meanwhile search for young Maker
has been made in eery direcion, bu
no he slighes clew o his where
abous has been discoered Excep
for he prins of he rubber soled

TUKN HIM DOWN.
Pretty maid, if you discover
That your ardent, pleading lover
Spends his time in loafing idly 'round
the town;
If the hair is carried bangy
Qn bis forehead, and he's slangy,
Don't you hesitate a moment- -
Turn him down.
If you note his eyebrows fusing
O'er the nose that he is using,
And the very least annoyance makes
He nas got a disposition
• That may land you in perdition,
And you'd better nerve yourself and
Turn him down;
If he pays no marked attention,
Doesn't even give it mention
When you meot him in a new and
charming gown,
Show him the door politely.
Tell him that his Sunday nigutly
Visits must be discontinued —
Turn him down.
If he talks about the races,
Calls the silver dollars "cases,"
Tells you how he "done up" Smith
and Jones and Brown;
If he meets you with a swagger,
And you catch the sniff of lager,
(jet your nerve in proper trim and
Turn him down.
Study well your pleading lover,
Or you may too late discover
That he'll place more thorns than
roses in your crown;
And if anything about him
Gives you slightest cause to doubt
him,
Do it in a gentle way, but
Turn him down.
HOW ANIMALS ESCAPE
EXXERMIN ATIO N.
How ia the balance of life on the
globe maintained? Why hare not spe
cies exterminated species? Why have
not tbe birds exterminated tbe insects
and hawks ant 1 owls exterminated the
birds? Because the insects are so
much more prolific than the birds
and the birds so tuucb . more prolific
than the hawks and owls. The hawks
and owls are more restricted as to
food. The more adaptive an animal is
the greater are the chances of surviv
ing. If wolves and foxes could browse
like deer and sheep and rabbits, they
would be as numerous as these latter
species.
The potato bug has unduly increas
ed in the East because its food is
abundant, and its enemies have not
appeared. The forest worms threaten
ed to destroy the maple woods of some
sections till its enemy, the ichnuman
fly> appeared. Kabbits have increas
ed unduly in Australia because their
natural enemies have not kept pace. —
Outiut;.
KEEPING AT IT.
It is a great mistake to suppose that
the best work of the world is done by
1 people of great strength and great op
portunities. It is unquestionably an
advantage to have both these things,
but neither of them, quoting from the
"Manufacturer ami Builder," is a
necessity to the man who has the spirit
and the pluck to achieve great results.
Some of the greatest work of our time
has been dove by men of physical
feebleness. No. man has left a more
distinct impressiou of himself on this
generation than Charles Darwin, and
there have boon few men who have had
to struggle against such prostrating
ill health. Darwin was rarely able to
work long at a time. He accomplish
ed his great work by having a single
aim, and putting every ounce of his
force and every hour of his time into
the task which he had set before him.
He never scattered his energy, he
never wasted au hour, and by steadily
keeping at it, in spite of continual ill
health and of long intervals of semi
invalidism, he did a great work, and
has left tho impression upon the
world of a man of extraordinary en
ergy end workiug capacity. Success
is rarely a matter of accident; always
a matter of character. The reason
why so mauy men fail is that so few
men are willing to pay tbe price of
self-denial and hard work which suo-
There is a Difference.
The diffeieuue between Kennedy's
Laxative Honey and Tar and all other
Cougb Syrups is that it moves the
bowels, thus expelling a cold from
the system. This relaxes the nerve
tissues and by its healing effect on tbe
throat and lungs tbe cough is relieved
—cured entirely. Kennedy's is the
original Laxitive Honey and Tar and
contains no opiates. Good alike tor
young or old. Tastes good. Sold by
