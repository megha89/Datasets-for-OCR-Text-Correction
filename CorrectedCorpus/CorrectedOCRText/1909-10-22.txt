TOO COMPLICTE
Tho Reason We Say "You" Insead of

•'you" Insead of "uou"ha I origi
naed us n I'ad of couresy— may ex
plain is origin, bu Is uniersal adop
ion is due o a deeper reason— namely,
ha he second person singular of he
erb Is a complicaed and difficul
form, while he second person plural
Is simple o he las degree ,
Wllh eery principal erb In he lan
guage and wih eery auxiliary excep
"mus" he pronoun "hou" requires a
special change in he form of he erb,
which is ofen he only break in an
oherwise uniform series Thus in he
presen ense of eery erb, wih he
single excepion of he erb "be" he
pronoun "you" employs he unchanged
roo form of he erb, as "you loe,
hae, can do shall, will" ec while
"hou" requires a change of form, as
"hou loes has, cans, dos, shal
wil" ec
In eery such choice he unchanged
roo form has always ho righ of way
Thus "you" has become eerywhere
