Scattered Too llneh
' "It always pays to be conseratie,"
said the careful man" "Now, I recall
the case of the man from yersille,
yer county, Tenu
"'I can lick any man In yersille,
he announced one day In the main
street of that illage
"There was no response 'I can lick
any man in yer county,' he then pro
claimed
"Still there was no reply to the chal
lenge Emboldened by the success of
hla bluff, the man shouted, 'I can lick
any man in Tennessee!'
"At that a long, lank mountaineer

Exhausted Brain Cells
 Nere specialists say that a great
many suicides are the direct results of
exhausted brain cells When you find
yourself becoming morose and despond
ent, when you are conscious that the
pest of life is eaporating, that you are
losing the edge of your former keen in
terest in things generally and that
your life is becoming a bore, you may
be pretty s4re that you need more
sleep; that you need country or out
door exercise If you get these, you
will find that all the old enthusiasm
will return A few days of exercise' in
the country rambling oer the hills and
meadows will erase the dark pictures
which haunt you and will restore buoy
ancy to your animal spirits— Success
Getting Into a Life Buoy
1 The aerage person in danger of
drowning usually attempts to lift a life
buoy oer bis bead, with the result
that he is immediately pJunged deeper
Into the water A good swimmer can
do this with a sudden upward jerk, but
with the nonswimmer it is almost an
Impossible feat
What he should do when he has
seized the buoy is to place both hands,
palms downward, on the buoy 6n the
part nearest the body, pressing it
downward and slightly away, when the
farther part of the buoy will rise out of
the water and actually fall oer the
head The arms can then be put
through easily, "and there you are"

"KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT"
People Who Say Little and rtnlt
Leas "Get There" Ofteneat
"Help me to catch him, mister," said
the small boy as he dashed by in pant
Ing pursuit of his juenile enemy
"Keep your mouth shut, and you'll
catch him," adised the man, and the
boy understood in an instant and, un
derstanding, closed his mouth and ran
on, easily running down the object of
his pursuit, who had been running
rpen mouthed and • was soon doubled
up with a stitch In his side
There Is a good deal in keeping your
mouth shut There are more people In
the world who neer open a mouth
without putting a foot in It than you
hae any Idea of You may be a fool,
but If you keep your mouth shut
who's to know it? Generally you can
size up the fellows who'll get there,
are getting there or hae got there by
the way their lower Jaw hangs You
may occasionally meet a wise man
wandering around with his mouth
open, but not as a usual thing
It's what people say and drink chief
ly that cause them to appear before
the police magistrate If they had
kept their mouths shut they would
not hae said It or drunk it More fool
ish fish are caught with hooks in the
mouth than through the tall The fel
low who goes around with his mouth
open may catch a few flies In the
aperture, but he Isn't likely to catch

The Cipher,
It has not been definitely established
that zero was in use any earlier than
400 A  About this time it was used
In India, and seeral centuries later
the Arabs began to employ it Through
the Arabs its use became known to
Europeans during the twelfth century
It was not generally adopted In Europe
until seeral centuries later, notwith
standing its great adantages For a
considerable time there were two par
ties among the European educators
One party, known as the algorists, far
ored the adoption of the pindoo sys
tem of notation (falsely called Arabic),
with its position alues, while the oth
er, known as the abacists, faored the
Roman notation, without zero or posi
tion alue
The general adoption of the Hindoo
system was greatly facilitated by the
facts that It was explained In most of
the calendars for more than a century,
beginning with 1300, and that the
mediaeal uniersities frequently of
fered courses deoted to the use of this
notation— G A Miller in Science
The ArtiHt and the Woman
, Eery actress Is sensitiely alie to
the pleasure of a warm reception— that
being the technical term for the ap
plause with which the audience greets
the first appearance of an artist before
any word baa been spoken Generally
speaking, it signifies a courteous greet
ing corresponding to a lifted hat and
pleasant salutation But on occasions
when the actress is a special faorite
the reception, enthusiastic and long
continued, becomes a demonstration
which is inartistic and destructie of
the illusion of the play, since it drags
the actress out of her part and in her
bowing, curtseying and smiling she
becomes Miss Jones or Miss Morris re

an would not be human who did not
enjoy to the last drop of her blood just

"FRIAY JUNE 19, 1903
 The persecution, of the Jews in
 Bessarabia and other parts of Russia
"'has gien birth to some discussion
?as to the propriety of other nations
» protesting against such atrocities,
ilt is out of the usual course, for
nation to interfere in the in
ternal affairs of another Russia,
j perhaps, of all the ciilized nations,
lis touchy on a proposition of this
; nature She will brook neither in
S terfererice nor adice from the out
j;sidel"' But there is historical prece
tdent for protest against religious
In the day^s of the
English Commonwealth the'Pta_B__u
tion of the peasantry in the~*PU
denses led to a igorous protest from
Protector Cromwell He intimated
to the authorities that unless' these
were stopped a fleet
" would be dispatched there for busi
 ness , And the persecutions ceased
without further action
Personal The newspapers of San Francisco
hae entered into a trust scheme
rThe Call, Chronicle, and Examiner
announce that after July Ist the sub
scription price will be $8 per year
by mail, or 75 cents per montn by
carrier This is an adance of 10
cents per month by carrier The
Examiner gets the best of this com
bine It has always, been a higher
priced paper than its cotemporaries
In getting its two morning competi
tors to jump the subscription price,
20 cents in the case of the Chronicle,
and $2 for the Call, while its own
price remains about the same, it has
got decidedly the best of the bargain
The plea that blank paper has ad
anced in price, and wages are on
the upgrade, is gauzy Tt seems
out of tune with the Examiner's
rabid antitrust pretensions, to join
in a combination to raise the price
of news Consistency is not one of
the irtues of yellow journalism
History records no darker deed
than the murder of the king and
queen of Seria Alexander was not
a model king, raga was far from
being a pattern of moral worth, but
their taking off at the hands of a
brutal and cowardly soldiery, for no
particular reason except that the
reolted army wanted a change of
dynasty, is calculated to lift them
from the rank of mediocrity to the
plane of martrydom The midnight
surprise of the royal pair, their pit
eous pleadings for life, in their ab
ject helplessness in the presence of
the military officers who by the laws
of the land and their indiidual
oaths were pledged to protect and
defend them; the brutal conduct of
the regicides after they had imbrued
their hands in the blood of their so
ereigns; the gloating of the excited
populace oer the assassinations,
and the burial of the dead in secret
at midnight, with scant ceremony,
after the fashion of plagueinfected
corpses,, are all ! strangely out of
joint with this enlightened age The
pretender Peter mounts to the
throne of Seria as the result of the
double regicide The crown is hand
ed to him crimsondyed with assass
ination And the strange part of it
is that those who accomplished this
reolution are not to be prosecuted
They are guaranteed immunity for
their misdeeds And Russia, whose
protege and faorite the new king of
Seria is said to be, refuses to con
sent to the trial of the murderers
Why?
President Rooseelt has incurred
the displeasure of the executie com
mittee of the Western Federation of
Miners because federal troops were
ordered to Morenci to presere the
peace which was seriously threaten
ed by the strike of the miners in that
camp He is denounced as a tmitor
to the principles of organized labor,
and the toilers are urged to ote
solidly at the next presidential elec
tion against a system that requires
for its perpetuation a resort to such
"murderous implements of barbar
ism" Wherefore this rabid denun
ciation of the chief executie of the
nation? Nothing more intemperate
has been heard in # the councils of
anarchists A strike leader, accom
panied by a number of men, waited
upon the superintendent of the
principal mine of the camp The
leader was well equipped with all
the implements of gun warfare The
superintendent was gien one minute
to close his mine In the presence
of superior force he wisely concluded
to obey the selfconstituted authority
that for the time being was para
mount to the United States Arizona
is a territory, and the cry for help
was promptly, responded to by a
squad of soldiers being hurriedly dis
patched to the spot to restore order
Under the protecting wing of federal
authority the leading agitators were
jailed, and peace returned We are
at a loss to understand what par
ticular principles of organized labor
President Rooseelt has betrayed
Certainly he has by this action dem
onstrated his fideUty to the princi
ples of the constitution and the laws
of his country, which he had taken a
solemn oath to defend It is safe to
say President Rooseelt will not lose
much sleep on account of this di
tribe; neither will he lose many otes
in consequence thereof

Guaging Station on the Mokelnmne
The subject of "storage of flood
waters" has been a subject that has
been freely discussed by the press dur
ing the past two years, but the public
do not realize the amount of work that
is being done in that direction by the
goernment, particularly so in Cali
fornia • Thirty guaging 'stations hae
been established throughout" the stato
on the arious riers of importance
The Mokelumne has been selected as
one of the riers necessary for fur
nishing data, and a station has recently
been established on the rier, a few
hundred yards below Electra George
House,' the machinist at the plant, has
been instructed in the work ad will
do the guaging and readings required
by Uncle Sam i,S G Bennett of the
U S geologicalsurey, is superintend
ing the work, and selected the location,
which is at a place I where the stream
runs smoothly and quietly Tha rier
iB about 100 yards wide at this point
A strong cable is stretched from bank
to bank, and suspended from which is
a trolly car capable of holding two
persons The car is used to ferry the
guager across the stream At interals
of about eery ten feet the depth of the
water is measured, and the elocity of
the current is registered by mean of
an electric current meter^ by which
the olume of water passing may be
determined This work is done at all
stages of the flow of the rier, and in
due time the records will show the
amount of water that is annually pass
ing down the stream, which will be of
material benefit to the goernment in
the cause of irrigation At the present
time about 2000 cubic feet of water is
passing in a second If it was properly
cared for,' the , number of thousand
acres of land that it would irrigate is
almost beyond imagination

eafness is caused by an inflamed con

flamed you hae a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can be
taken out and this tube restored to its

HIGH SCHOOL CARRIES
Union istrict for the Taller Commands
Strong Majority
The question of the establishment
of a union high school to be cared out
of eight school districts in township two
was submitted to popular ote in all
the districts Interested last Saturday
Outside of lone the ote polled was
small In lone the election awakened
much interest, eidenced by the ery
heay ote polled It was a foregone
conclusion that as lone went so would
go the district And the sentiment for
the high school was oerwhelming, in
deed almost unanimous for the school
The election was a onesided affair
Only two districts gae an aderse
ote, Lancha Plana and Camp Opra
The ote in the respectie districts was
as followsPersonal
Yes No Total
Camp Opra 3 4 7
Lancha Plana 0 14  14
Mount Echo 8 0 8
Mount Pleasant 3 1 4
Mt Springs 7 0 7
Carbondale 7^ 0 7
Union 6 4 10
lone 141 22 163
Total 175 45 220
Majority for 130
The next step is the location of the
school There will be no contest on
this point lone is the central part of
the district, and the most populous,
and the school will unquestionably be
there They hae had practically a
high school for seeral years, known
as the academy The high school will
simply take the place of this institu
tion The formal proceedings of locat
ing the school will be carried out by
the schooi superintendent, who within
15 days after receiing the returns of the
election, will direct each district to call
a meeting of the electors to select one
representatie The representaties so
chosen must thereafter meet and name
the school, and determine the location
If they fail to agree unanimously, the
matter must be then reported to the
school superintendent, whose duty it
will then be to call an election to select
where the school shall be located In
the present case, the location is irtu
ally fixed The academy closed the
term last Friday The high school
will probably be opened in September
Excursion to Stockton
A great oent is planned for Stock
ton on Tuesday the 23rd inst, when
the Business Men's Association of "that
place will run their first excursion It
is to be made a grand occasion intended
to show the people of the interior
towns how really good a trading center
Stockton has become Within the
past year new life and energy hae
been infused into the city until it has
become one of the busiest places of the
interior, and as an eidence of their
goaheadatieness the merchants hae
got together and projected a grand ex
cursion which leaes lone on tho morn
ing of the 23rd at 8Personal00 o'clock, reach
ing Stockton at 9Personal55 Returning this
train leaes Stockton at 5Personal00 p m,
reaching lone at 6Personal55 Thus giing
the people a fine day's outing and al
lowing them tp return to lone on the
same day, or, if preferred, they may
remain oer and take any returning
train on the following day (Wednes
day) It will be a jolly occasion, and
will no doubt draw people by the
thousands, as almost eery merchant
in the city has made a special sale day
of it, and besides cutting prices beyond
all precedent, will gie away some
bpautiful and useful article ranging in
alue from $2 to $40; eery isitor to
tho arious stores being gien a cou
ppn entitling him to a chance in the
article to bo "gien away, without mak
ing any purchases whateer By this
plan eerybody gets a chance at eery
store and as tho gifts in the aggregate
amount in aluo to nearly $300 it is
certainly a prize worth going for A
fine band will be in attendance all day
and escort the excursionists to and
from the depot, as well, and other at
tractions will be offered, the details of
which hae not as yet been fully de
cided upon The fare for the round
trip will be the same as a single trip
ticket or $335 from Jackson and re
turn, so we infer that on Tuesday,
June 23rd, Jackson and the surround
ing towns will be practically deserted
Fishing at Siler Lake
Constable Laerone and Vie Rocco
started out oer two weeks ago for
Siler lake for the purpose of getting
a load of trout for market All kinds
of rumors hae been afloat to explain
their long absence The weather since
they set forth has been unusually cold,
with probably heay storms in the lake
region It was reported that they were
srrow bound All disquieting rumors
hae been set at rest by the arrial of
Johnny Allen and Grant Shealor from
the lakes with 50 dozen fish They
captured the game in the lower part of
the lake, whereas Laerone and Rocco
went to the upper part, in the pejghbor
hood of Plasse r s ranch They brought
down the news that the absence of the
pair is owing to indifferent fishing
They hae tarried in the hope of get
ting a load U» justify the time and ex
pense incurred Fish hae been slow
to bite The run from the streamlets
to the lake had scarcely commenced,
and this is the time— being the spawn
ing season — when the trout are readily
taken The two fishermen are de
termined to fight it out with the
denizens of j the lake if ij, takes all
summer

gathering The isitors were from
eery part of the county, some trael
ing from the other side of Oleta The
day was unusually cold and chilly for
the season of the year' Indeed, it was
anything but picnic weather, and this
in some respects militated against the
affair, especially the financial part, of
it The sale of ice cream and ice cold
beer was not as rushing as it would
hae been under other conditions
Neertheless a thoroughly enjoyable
time was had For the juenile part
of the gathering a merrygoround and

come of this departure from long
established usage It was the same
wjth the hpj§eless cajriaee in t(]ecit|es
omestic animals soon became accus
tomed to the change, and now are no
more afraid of the automobile than a
street car It will be the same with
the introduction of the traction engine
in this county Some trouble may be
experienced at tho outset, but in a com
paratiely brief space this method of
freighting will be looked uppp as com
monplace It is not the intention of
the company to inade the towns with
the traction engine The deliery of
oil and other supplies to the mines will
be done with horse teams as heretofore
We understand that a depot will be es
tablished in the neighborhood of Mar
tell's station This will be the terminus
of trael for the traction engine From
this point the material will be taken to
the different mines with horse power
At one trip the engine will be able to
haul up from 30 to 40 tons, enough to
keep one or two teams busy in coney
ing the same to nearby mines  The
road from lone to within about a mile
of Mountain Springs has been placed
in tolerably smooth condition for trac
tion engine trael The rough and
rocky portion of tho highway from
Mountain Springs to the bottom of the
Morrow grade, is likely to test the en
durance of this kind of coneyance
No doubt this difficulty can be oer
come At the Gwln mine the traction
engine has gien such satisfaction that
auother and larger engine has been or
is to be put on the road The first one
was a secondhand machine, put on
the road as an experiment Now it is
reported that the experimental stage
has been passed, and arrangements are
being made \o adopt the method of
hauling as a permanent and profitable
business
The engine was expected to start
work early this week, but owing to
some fixing required the initial trip
had to be postponed It may make
the first trip today, or at the latest
Monday

Grapes in Amador County
J H BARBER
To ride through the ineyards of
Amador county at this time of year
and note the luxuriant growth of the
ines, or later in the season, at the
height of the intage, to iew them
loaded with purpie clusters of luscious
grapes, is to be coninced beyond
doubt that the hillsides of this county
are preeminently adapted to grape
growing  Closer inestigation of the
character of the soil, of the grapes
produced on it and the quality ot the
wine made from them by good methods,
leads to the belief that our foothills
can compete in the production of high
grade wines with the foothills of the
coast range, which themseles are
competing successfully with the best
wine regions of the old world
It is true that in quantity of product
the foothill ineyards cannot hope to
rial those of the alley, regions, but in
quality the hill lands easily surpass the
richer, heaier soils of the alleys
This is as true in the foothills of the
Sierra as in those of the coast range,
and it is a point worth remembering,
as indicating the end toward which the
foothill ineyardist should strie In
the production of lowgrade, cheap
wines he can neer compete with the
alleys; but in the making of light,
dry wines of high quality he has a
field into which they cannot enter 
Winemaking methods in this county
are as yet comparatiely crude, the
wine going mostly intp t^e local market
on accoqnt ot the lack of cheap and
easy transportation out of the county
But already some wine is being shipped
east, and with better transportation
facilities and more modern methods of
wine making the outside market could
be easily and rapidly extended
More attention must be gien also to
the planting of the better arieties qf
winegraßes, wtyhout whlph'it is not
possible  make high class winesPersonal So
far, planting has been largely confined
to the most productie arieties, re
gardless of quality, b,qt thc inqr care
ful |neyarqists whq make their pwn
wines are gradually introducing better
kinds fqr blending with the Mission
and other arieties of large crops but
poor quality
A ery interesting question in this
connection is the relatie yield of dif
ferent arieties on our foothill soils A
good idea of this may be gained from
the following figures taken from the
records pf tjie tf S Agricultural Ex
periment Station of California in this
county The list includes the best red
wine arieties at the station, combin
ing quality with good bearing, and
gies the approximate yield of each for
the past flye yearg r Personal , • "
Bach ariety at the station is planted
on both red and granite soil The red
soil gies the best crops so far, and this
is the preailing toil of the foothills
which would naturally be used for ine
yards It is interesting, howeer, to
note also the yield on the poorer, de
composed granite soil The ines were
bet out from 1889 to 1892, with some
later planting to fill acancies in the
rows, wherg the original ines bailed to
grow They hae neer been irrigated,
but hae had good cultiationPersonal

Aramon makes a good light wine of
moderate color but not high flaor It
should be blended with a ariety of
heaier character and deeper color,
such as the Malbec
Carignane, Mataro and Mourastel,
make good wines of fair body and
quality  •*
Charbono grows well and bears well
een on poor soil It yields a wine of
good color, but ueutral in character
and not of high quality; ery useful
for blending with arieties of more
astringency
Malbec makes wine of doeu color,
with good body and astringency
Should be a good grape to blend with
the Mission, so oommon In local ine
yards, to gie color and character to
the poor product of the latter
Mission (also known locally as the
"California grape") is wellknown as a
igorous grower and heay bearer,
yielding well een with indifferent care
It gies a ery poor wine, howeer,
lacking in color, character, and eery
thing else that goes to make a good
red wine Fair wines might be made
from it by proper blending with a
ariety of pronounced character and
color like the Malbec or Mondeuse; or
if neutral wine of good color were de
sired, the Charbono Color alone would
be best imparted to it by a small pro
portion of one of the "color" grapes
Teinturier or Bouschet
Mondeuse is an excellent grape, gi
ing wine of good color and body and
high quality
Tinta Valdepenas is described by
Professor Bjoletti as "one of the grapes
most suited to the hotter parts of the
state for the production of dry red
wines" 
Tinta Amarella and Tinta Madeira
are good grapes of the port type The
latter makes flue port of high quality,
which is improed by blending with
Tinta Amarella The last named has
less character than the T Madeira,
but as a rule bears bettor
These brief notes are culled from the
reports of iticultural work at the
agricultural department of the Uni
ersity of California, including practical
winemaking tests of the different
arieties

A Stubborn Hnsband
A most interesting phenomenon is
the stubborn husband He is not a bad
man He is contrary, and he has to be
managed He Is usually married to a
cleer little woman, who is constantly
deising schemes to accomplish tho
things which make their joint lies a
success
He has no suspicion of this If he
had, he would be so mad he could un
doubtedly eat her So all through life
she goes on swinging a turnip ahead
of his nose to make him go the same as
though he were a balky mule She is
a cheery little body, and she grows
plump with eery year, and she does
her smiling behind the door or she
chuckles In her sleee when he is not
by The stubborn husband is as inter
esting as a bug— London Standard

nddhlst Prayer Wheels
In the sacred city of Ourga, the head
quarters of Mongolian Buddhism, are
numerous "prayer ' wheels," inscribed
with prayers and dedications to Bud
dha, and the more they are turned the
more religious they make you Many
of the more deout persons turn small
er wheels held in the left hand while
manipulating the large oue with the
right hand Curious bits of rags fly
ing aboe the palisades of the Inclo
sures of the town are "prayer flags"
No Mongolian house is without them—
the more the better— for each one is
supposed to coney a prayer to Bud

A FISH OUT OF WATEP
The Unfortunate Frolic That Canned
Its Untimely eath
A German scientist— he could only
hae been a German— once conceied,
we are told, a plan to train a fish to
lie out of water J He placed a thri
ing little carp in a small tank and with
infinite patience and great exactness
remoed from the tank one spoonful
of water eery day, at the same time
Increasing gradually the amount of
»xygen in the water In time the wa
ter barely coered the carp, and still it
thried The quantity of water con
tinued to diminish, and, by slowly
adapting Its method of breathing to
the new conditions, the flsh began to
breathe air and Indeed became i quite
terrestrial In its habits before the tank
was entirely dry The scientist had
grown to loe the carp He fed It from
his own hand,, and now that it was li
ing in the same element 'with himself
he took it from the tank and left It as
free to follow its own deices as was
the family cat The little flsh also
loed its muster It followed him about
from place to place, flopping along aft
er him, stopping only occasionally to
leap for a passing fly One day the
scientist was crossing a bridge The
carp, as usual, was at his heels, enjoy
ing the pleasant air of the countryside
and uttering from time to time a little
sound expressie of delight and con
tentment About the middle of the
bridge a fat housefly was sunning it
self on the rail The carp spied the
fly and jumped for it, but miscalculat
ing the distance went' oer the rail Into
the rier— and was drowned — Great

Language is the subtlest instrument
eer played on by man Its ariations
are illimitable— that is, they are limit
ed only by the powers of the human
mind and soul in all possible situations
The power of words or speech exceeds
that of music because language is more
than music and een Includes music
Language In the hands of a master Is
pregnant with eery meaning
A nation's language is at once an ex
pression and a mold of Its character,
reflecting from century to century the
deelopment of Its ciilization and its
adance In Intellectual and moral cul
ture, In learning and refinement The
flexible Greek tongue was the product
and the instrument of the subtle Greek
intellect The distinctie qualities of
the classic speech of the Roman de
clare the dignity and the irile energy
which were inseparable from tbe old
Roman— Portland Oregonlan
How Romans Tools Their Food
 The Romans reclined at their ban
quets on couches, all supporting them
seles on one elbow and eating with
their fingers from dishes placed In the
center of the table Each was supplied
with a napkin, and knies were used,
though it does not appear that eery
one was supplied with one Nothing,
It would seem, could be more fatiguing
than to partake of a repast In such an
awkward posture or less conducie to
neatness, It being almost impossible to
keep the hands clean een with water
supplied by the slaes or to preent the
food and wine from falling on the
clothing and the draperies of the couch
This manner of eating disappeared
during the dark ages so far as the
couch was concerned, but the peculiar
ity of taking the food with fingers from
a common dish continued afterward
for more than 1,000 years
Tbe Hind nrlnar Sleep
"uring sleep," says an authority on
mental subjects, "the workings of the
mind are under no control, and yet It
seems to hae a wonderful faculty of
building up and arranging scenes and
Incidents I remember once haing a
iid dream of going into a house the
furniture and inmates of which ' be
longed to the middle ages So clear
was the dream that I had no difficulty
in recalling it, and then as I went oer
each detail of dress, armor, Jewelry, or
naments and other objects seen in my
ision I realized that eerything I had
beheld was historically accurate— that
is to say, that probably in a fraction of
a second my mind had conjured up a
scene to construct which, with tbe
same faithfulness to detail, while
awake would hae taken me seeral
hours"
Marelous Memories
Among men noted for wonderful
memories were Milton, who was said
to be able to repeat Homer; Professor
Lawson, who boasted that he could re
peat the whole of the Bible, except a
few erses; Lord Macaulay, who made
the same boast about "Pilgrim's Prog
ress" and "Paradise Lost;" r Lerden,
a friend of Sir Walter Scott, who could
repeat an act of parliament on hearing
it read but once, and a London report
er, who took no notes, but could write
out an unexpected debate erbatim
Henry Clay could not memorize a sin
gle stanza of a poem, but neer forgot
a name, a face or an argument

How to Sell Goods
 " Tou must know how to talk with a
customer so that, she will buy,' is one
of the things the'buyer says oer and
oer again in his lectures down in the
basement Een when the girl is be
hind the counter •at work the buyer
will often step up and gie her a hint
For Instance, he will gie a new name
to an old piece of goods There is e
erything in a name He came up to
me one day and said, 'Call that line of
goods the Marlborough,' and it was not
long before I had sold the entire stock
The sweller a name Is the better, of
course Cumberland pins will sell much
better than plain pins een if they are
the same thing French names are
much In ogue, too, and they are some
times coined Names taken from swell
sports are also ery good sellers An
other thing, of course, which helps a
girl sell the goods Is genuine knowl

Australians' Blgr Appetite
Perhaps the most astonishing statis
tics in • Mr Cougblan's book, "Seen
Colonies of Australasia," are those that
describe what the aerage Australian
eats and drinks Apparently ' he has
the best appetite, if not the best diges
tion, of any human being on the planet
He eats eery year 264 pounds of meat,
which works out an aerage of two
cheep and onefifth of a bullock for e
ery man, woman and baby in Australa
sia He eats more than twice as much
meat as the aerage Englishman, three
times as much as the aerage French
man and four times as much as the a
erage German or Swiss He eats, In
addition, about 875 pounds of wheat,
225 pounds of potatoes and almost 100
pounds of sugar If he is a Tasma
nlan, he eats a quarter of a ton of po
tatoes in a year, a quite surprising feat
A Rare Old Boole
The second book printed in the Eng
lish language was "The Game and
Playe of the Chess," which the title
page says was "Fynyshid the last day
of Marche, the yer of our lord god a
thousande foure hondred and LXXIIJ"
Only twele copies of the work are
now known to exist In 1818 an Eng
lishman of the name of Alchorne sold
his copy for a sum equal to $270 in
United States currency Fiftysix years
later, in 18(10, the same olume (an im
perfect copy) was sold for $2,150 The
British museum has refused an offer of
$10,000 for its copy, which is imper
fect to the extent of haing seen

Not the Same
"If s a merciful dispensation of Pro
idence that makes consumpties al
ways hopeful It's just heaen's mercy
that keeps them from realizing' how
bad they are"
"Huh! And what is it that keeps
some singers from realizing how bad
they are? Would you call that hea

Times
Marriage by Capture
Marriage by capture is a ery old
and ery widely spread custom It
preails among the Hindoos, the Kal
mucks and Circassians and the primi
tie races of Australia, New Zealand
and America, but instead of abduction
being considered an outrage by these
half ciilized peoples it is looked upon
as a preliminary marriage rite, and, as
a general rule, the coy damsel is by no
means aerse to the mild iolence"
Abduction became so common In Eng
land in the reigns of the Tudor princes
that a statute was passed on the sub
ject, and this was followed by an act
of Elizabeth which took away the ben
efit of clergy from the offender, and It
was not till so late as the reign of
George IV that the crime ceased to be
a capital offense and punishable with
death
What the White House Is
To the American people the White
House represents the personality of the
president of the United States To the
politician the magic words may stand
for the goal of an ambition too often
associated with the deepest and most
poignant disappointment, while to the
historian the name may typify deci
sions that hae marked epochs in the
affairs of nations In the mind of the
people, howeer, the official character
of the building has always been subor
dinate to its domestic uses Popularly
speaking, the White House is the place
not where the president works, but
where he entertains— Charles Moore in
Century
•  The Nurse
The London Hospital complains that
the word "nurse" means too many dif
ferent things, from the board school
girl of fourteen, who gets 2 shillings a
week for minding the baby, to the
highly skilled nurse who follows the
army doctor to the ery battlefield
