SPOILED THEIR BAY
THE CADET 3 HAD A LAUGH AT '
OFFICERS' EXPENSE
flow s Billiard Table Was Smug; T
' Into the Barracks at 'West Pi I
and the Story of Its Accident 
, Di»covery
There are many traditions and str
ries of escapades at the Military acade
my at West Point that are handed
down from class to class, and one of
the most Interesting of these is that re
lating to the billiard table Shortly
after the civil war the cadets, always
on the alert for some new scheme for
amusement, decided that they, would
like to have a billiard table and ac
cordingly organized a billiard club A
collection was taken up with which to
purchase a table, and a suitable place
was sought In which to set it up Until
the present steam heating apparatus
was Installed in the cadet barracks,
about 30 years or more ago, the heat-
Ing was by means of furnaces The
basement of the sixth division of the
barracks was used for coal bins, the
bins being so arranged that there was
a large one near the center of the
building, which could only be reached
by passing through one of the others
After considering all available places*
this coal bin was finally selected as be
ing the place least liable to detection,
for it must be remembered the table
was unauthorized
The table was bought In New York
and sent to Garrisons, across the river,
for there was no West Shore railroad
In those days One cold winter night
It was hauled by a team of oxen across
the river on the Ice and up the bill and
was safely stowed away In the coal bin
before morning The table was soon
set up and became a source of great
•njoyment to the cadets A keg of
beer  was always kept on tap and
lamps were hung from the ceiling, giv
ing the room a cheery appearance
The members of the club used to gath
er there at a!l hours of the day and
night, when their presence was not re
quired, elsewhere by their duties, and
sit around smoking, drinking and tell
ing stories while two of them played
billiards
y-The authorities soon became aware
that there was a billiard table some
where In the barracks, for they could
bear the balls clicking together, but
they could not find It The cadets con
tinued to enjoy the privileges of the
billiard club for more than a year 
Finally one night soon after mid
night,, as two officers were returning
from a convivial evening at the mess,
they saw two cadets, clad in their un
derclothing and dressing gowns,
emerge from the north sallyport and
disappear down the steps to the area
way In front of the barracks Instant
ly the thought of the billiard table
flashed through the minds of the two
officers, and they started quietly after
the cadets On reaching the basement
doorway of the sixth division the two
cadets entered, and the officers, arriv
ing a moment later, saw them climb
over a pile of coal and enter an open
door, through which came sounds of
laughter and conversation and the
clicking of balls, while the air was la
den with fragrant tobacco smoke
The  officers paused for a moment
and held a whispered consultation
Finally deciding that they would tell
the other officers of their discovery and
have all of them come down the fol
lowing night and enjoy the fun of a
raid on the club, they withdrew and
went home" Next day all the officers
at the post were informed of the dis
covery, and It was arranged that the
raid should occur at midnight
All might have gone well, and the
officers might have had their little fun,
had It not been that there were three
cadets the previous night Instead of
two The third bad forgotten his pipe
and bad gone back for It, while the
other two went on and were discover
ed by the officers The third, coming
along a moment later, saw the officers
and quietly followed them, observing
all their movements and listening to
their whispered conversation
•When they withdrew, he went in and
told the members of the club all he had
heard and seen The cadets at once
realized that It was all up with the
dub, but they determined to have a
laugh at the expense of the officers
'Accordingly all arrangements were
made before the dub adjourned, that
night
The next night the officers met as ar
ranged and crept stealthily down the
areaway and Into the sixth division
Hearing no sound of clicking balls,
some became skeptical and concluded
the whole thing was a hoax, bnt never
theless they pushed on and climbed
over, the pile of coal Opening the
door, they were greeted with a glow of
light, but still no sound On entering
they ' found the room deserted, but
there were the billiard table, an almost
untouched keg of beer, several pounds
of tobacco, some chairs and lastly a
note on the table, addressed to the offi
cers on duty at West Point The note
was to the effect that as the officers of
the post had been so kind as to permit
the -club to continue Its existence for
more than a year It desired to present
to them (the officers) the table and all
its appurtenances, as It was deemed
expedient to wind up the club's affairs
The note was signed "The Executive
Committee"
The officers, of course, were much
chagrined at being thus outwitted by
the cadets Nevertheless the table was
removed to the officers', mess and, ac
cording to tradition, is the one still In

The Amador Ledger
Eccentric Testators
Joseph Dalky takes the opportunity
afforded by his will of insulting his
son-in-law in terms which doubtless
had a pungency once, but which are
hardly comprehensible to the modern
readerPersonal "I give to my daughter, Ann
Spencer, a guinea for a ring or any
other bauble she may like better; I lye
to the lout her husband, one penny to
buy him a lark whistle, and this legacy
I give him as a mark of my apprecia
tion of his prowess and nice honor in
drawing his sword on me (at my own
table), naked and unarmed as I was
and he well fortified with custard"
A grewsome legacy is that of Philip
ThicknessePersonal "I leave my right band, to
be cut off nfter my death, to my son
nnd I desire It may, be sent to him in
hopes that such a sight may remind
him of his duty to God after having so
long abandoned the duty be owed to a
father who once affectionately loved
him"
Another father seems apparently to
have begun his will with the determi
nation of punishing an unruly son, but
as the fairy stories say, all ends hap
pily We refer to the will of Richard
Crawshay, the founder of the famous
Welsh Ironworks It runs thusPersonal "To
my only son who never would follow
my advice and has treated me rudely
In very many Instances, instead of
making him my executor and residuary
legatee (as till this day he was) I give
htm £100000"— Chambers' Journal
Extreme Affectation
A young man whose battered suit
case was red and pink and yellow with
the labels of European hotels boarded
a street car and said to the conductorPersonal
"I go six blocks How much?"
"Oh, only a nickel!" the conductor
answered But the young man hand
ed over 15 cents, saying, "Buy yourself
a glass of beer and a cigar on me"
Tbe conductor gave thanks for the
tip and added, "Just back from Eu
rope, hey?"' And to bis Interrogation
tbe young man nodded assent
-Out on the back platform afterward
tbe conductor described tbe episode to
a couple 'of passengers "He asked me
what the Tare was for six blocks*' he
said, "and then he gave me a tip" It
was a case of fake absentmindedness

An Old Time English Election
The only contest which occurred at
Gatton I within historic memory was
curious enough Sir Mark Wood, who
had been one of Its members for sever
al years, bad as his colleague In tbo
parliament of 1812 Sir William Con Personal
greve the Inventor of the famous "Con
greve rocket" The latter resigned In
ISIC, and the baronet wished his own
son to fill the vacancy" •
There were only three voters In the
constituency Sir Mark, his son and his
butler, named Jennings, but as the son
was away and the butler had quarreled
with his master an opportunity was af
forded for a singular revenge Jen
nings refused to second Sir Mark's
nomination of his son and proposed
himself, and a deadlock was averted
only by Sir Mark coming to terms with
the refractory butler, whose nomina
tion he seconded in order to induce him
to act as seconder to his son
Matters being thus put formally in
train, Sir Mark arranged with Jen
nings that the former's vote should be
alone given, and the final state of the
poll at Gatton's only known contest
stood thusPersonal Wood (Tory), I; Jennings

A Successful Stratagem
When the electric telegraph was first
introduced into Chile, a stratagem was
resorted to in order to guard the posts
and wires against damage on the part
of the natives and to maintain the con
nection between the strongholds on the
frontier There were at the time be
tween 40 and 50 captive Indians in the
Chilean camp General Pinto, in com
mand of the operations, called them to
gether and, pointing to the telegraph
wires, saidPersonal
"Do you see those wires?"
"Tes, general"
"I want you to remember not to go
neir or touch them, for if you do your
hands will be held, and you will be un
able to get away"
The Indians smiled incredulously
Then the general made them each in
succession take hold of the wire at
both ends of an electric battery In full
operation, after which he exclaimedPersonal
"I command you to let go the wire!"
"I can't! My hands nrb benumbed!"
cried each Indian
The battery was then stopped Not
long after the general restored them to
liberty, giving them strict Instructions
to keep the secret This had the de
sired effect, for, as might be expected,
the experience was related in the
strictest confidence to every man In the
tribe, and the telegraph remained un
molested
An Apt Amendment
Years ago a bill entitled "An act for
the preservation of the heath hen and
other game" was Introduced Into the
New York bouse of assembly
The speaker of the house, who was
not especially interested In matters of
this kind, gravely read It, "An act for
the preservation of the heathen and
other game"
He was blissfully unconscious of his
blunder until an honest member from
the northern part of the state who had
suffered from the depredations of the
frontier Indians rose to his feet
"I should like to move an amendment
to the bill," he said mildly, "by adding
the words, 'except Indians' "—Youth's

A FAMOUS BEAUTY'S RESCUE
Emily Marshall's Walk Orer a Hu-
man Bridge at Niagara
Writing of "The Loveliest Woman In
All America," William Perrine, in The
Ladles' Home Journal, recalls tbe
thrilling adventure of Emily Marshall,
tbe famous Boston beauty, Xt Niagara
Falls She, with Nathaniel P Willte
and a young, ungainly college student,
Job Smith, attempted to go under the
(alls In those days a perilous undertak
ing After they had proceeded a short
distance under the sheet of water there
was a rambling noise and a commotion,
and a part of thc ledge which formed
the path disappeared, cutting Miss
Marshall off from her companions by
an abyss six feet in width' and leaving
her but a small stone In the swirling
torrents to stand upon
"In the commotion Job had been for
gotten, but Instantly a ray of hope shot
Into Willis' heart when he saw his rug
ged features, his sandy hair plastered
over his forehead, his scanty dress
clinging to bis form like a skin and his
hand trembling on the poet's shoulder
as he steadied his steps Without say-
Ing what be intended to do he crept
down carefully to the edge of the foam
ing abyss till he' stood up to his knees
In the breaking bubbles It seemed Im
possible that he could reacb tbe lovely
creature ' or that she could jump for
ward safely from the slippery rock In
to his arms
"Willis covered his eyes In fear and
wonder The next moment when he
opened them there lay &t his feet tbe
quivering and exhausted girl Job was
nearly seven feet high Ke had flung
himself over the gulf, caught tbe rock
with his fingers and with certain death
If he missed his hold Miss Marshall
had quickly walked over his body In Its
brldgelike posture At this moment the
guide returned with a rope, fastened it
around one of Job's feet and dragged
him back through the whirlpool When
he recovered from his Immersion, he
fell on his knees in a prayer of thanks
to God, In which the poet and the beau
ty devoutly joined him"
The Professor's) Escaped Baeterla
He was apparently an old man, wore
large spectacles and carried a small
satchel Across the satchel was label
ed; "Professor Redd, Chicago" He en
tered the waiting room of a suburban
Btatlon and deposited the satchel care
lessly near the ice cooler Suddenly
those near saw the satchel fail and
heard the sharp tinkle of breaking
glass The old man picked up the glass
and muttered exclamations of distress
"To think I brought them all the way
from Brazil," he said
"What • were they T' Inquired some
one in the sympathetic crowd
"Germs!"
"What?" •',
"Bacteria of a strange Brazilian fe
ver" v Personal '
"Quick, man! Crush them with your
foot!" ;; Personal
"I can't sir They are now floating
around In the air"
There was a moment of horror Then
there was a rush, and a little later the
old man was the only occupant of the
waiting room A window was raised
from the outside
"Just let them out easy, Pete," cau
tioned a voice
And the bogus professor obeyed
Satchels, grips and cases went through
the window After he had finished col
lecting the professor followed the
booty His false beard fell back In the'
room, but he did not attempt to reclaim
It The arrival of their train prompted
those outside to venture in for their
baggage It had vanished, and the
black beard told the tale — Chicago

"The Devil's Turnip Patch"
On the top of Bald Eagle mountain,
Just where the old turnpike breaks
over the brow down into Black Hole
valley, is a queer field of rock, whlcn
years ago was christened "The Devil's
Turnip Patch" The rocks, which are
of a reddish sandstone, have a striking
peculiarity of all standing on end, thus
forming a Jagged, irregular surface,
that won for it its queer name from
the early settlers
'In bygone days, when the stages
r-beeied their way up from Northum
berland to Willlamsport, the four in
bands traversed the old pike that skirts
the turnip patch, and the strange gar
den of rocks was a constant source of
wonderment to the traveler Added
to Its interest as a natural curiosity is
a Mdden stream of water somewhere
beneath the standing stones, the noisy
flowing of which forms a romantic
song beneath one's feet Nobody
knows where the source of this stream
Is, nor can anybody find where it emp
ties itself Into Black Hole valley
The rock field covers an area of two
or three acres, with its widest part to
the north, then narrowing down V
shaped to the south, where the angle
is lost In a fringe of stunted hemlocks
and elders Theorists have figured on
the cause of this mountain freak, but
the theory obtaining most credence Is
that It Is a legacy of the glacial age,
the rocks being a collection pushed
Into their "present vertical position by
the moving Ice— Philadelphia Record
Trying; • Donkey
A newcomer In Africa has many
surprises A B Lloyd, the author of
"Dwarf Land and Cannibal Country,"
narrates an amusing little experience
of his own in purchasing a donkey In
ZanzibarPersonal
We had to procure donkeys, by no
means an easy task Of course each
one had to be tried, as we were to use
them for riding purposes, and in the
'course of the work we had various ex
periences I had set my mind upon a
fine female donkey and took her out
for an afternoon's ride I shall not
forget it At first when I mounted her
she would not move, In spite of all
my most tender persuasions, and final
ly she began to back
Now, the streets of Zanzibar are very
narrow, -and coming up behind me was
a large bollock wagon My sweet tem
pered donkey backed right on to the
horns of the bullocks Then It was no
longer a case of making her go, but of
making ber stop
Away she flew, right along the Naza
Moja road, and nothing I could do
would check ber headlong career In
fact, I soon tired of trying and let her
go On she went, right In among the
cocoanut trees, regardless of every
thing until she came to a steep bank
Here she stopped This showed that
she had good sense, and I decided to
keep her
South Sea Superstitions
In the south sea islands the old gods
are still very close to present life,
despite the vigorous profession of the
newer faith which the missionaries
have Introduced On village greens the
Btone churches rise Into prominence
The people are unremitting in their
attendance upon the services, wearing
clean white shirts and gaudy bonnets,
according to the sex of the worship
ers, and carrying their Bibles and
hymnbooks wrapped In spotless hand
kerchiefs But in the jungles and on
the waters no Samoan quite forgets
bis ancestral gods, the powers of na
ture, and In the domain of the hunter
and the fisher these old gods reign
supreme
Moralists may not assume to blame
them as untutored savages practicing
absurd superstitions of an Inferior race,
for if any moralist will only go a-fisb-
Ing with people of the Infinitely su
perior Caucasian race he cannot avoid
seeing a few practices which may not
be superstitions, but which are certain

Custom Influences Language
Pomologists, like botanists, find it
impossible to enforce the rules of prior
ity in names of fruits and flowers In
fruits the names of Bartlett for a pear
and Telegraph for a grape have not
been changed In spite of the efforts of
leading poniologlsts and pomological
societies to support prior names Those
who lead in these good efforts forget
that the only law for language Is the
law of custom In a famous grammar
we are told "the English language re
quires the pronoun 'It' for ail Inani
mate objects," but custom has so firmly
made the sun a he and the moon a she
that we have accept It Thus it will
ever be To secure the adoption of a
prior name reformers must bestir
themselves before custom gets posses

THE NEW BOARD
The old Board of Supervisors met on Monday morning
last and finished the business devolving upon it by noon In
the afternoon the members of the new Board proceeded to or
ganize by electing Fred B LeMoin as chairman The new
members of the Board,' Newman, Moore and Amick, soon got
into working condition and the business preceeded without
any friction Dr A M Gall was elected county physician,
vice Dr Simmons resigned appointment is an excell
ent one and gives general satisfaction For Steward ol the
County Hospital, there were several applicants, but the per
simmon went to Mr Arthur Barrett of Pine Grove, and the
appointment is considered a good one Mr Barrett stands
high in the community in which he lives, and will no doubt
administer the affairs of the hospital economically and with
ability As the proceedings appear elsewhere in this paper
we will not particularize The Ledger congratulates the
new Board on the appointments made and the strictlj' busi
ness style of its first^ meeting It also thanks each member
thereof for^ the unanimous vote that made this paper the of
ficial organ of the Board
PRIMARY BILLS
-From an article in yesterday's "Examiner," entitled
"Primary Bills to be Presented," we take the following ex
cerptPersonal
 " The primary elections bills most discussed so far are
the measure to be introduced by Senator Davis and the meas
ure to be introduced by Assemblyman Johnson * * *
- "The Davis bill is commonly regarded as standing the
best chance of becoming law, It has several features not
found in other bills The test provision, after several changes
and revisions, now reads as followsPersonal
'The voter must be asked by the ballot clerk and must
state the name of the party whose ticket he desires to vote
The ballot clerk shall then as a party test ask him this ques
tion and none otherPersonal "Do you indorse the principles of the
party you have named, according to the most recent declara
tion of its principles by the highest authority in that party?"
Upon receiving an affirmative answer thereto and not other
wise he shall be furnished the official ballot of that party and
permitted to vote thereon ; and he shall not be permitted to
vote any other party ballot at that election" * *  *
"The bill prescribes one form of official ballot for all
parties, those of the different parties to be distinguished from
each other by the party name printed on a slip projecting be
yond the top of the ballot, so as to be seen when the ballot is
folded This prevents any possibility of the voter or any
election officer substituting another ballot for that furnished
on which to vote after taking the test, and is important in en
abling the ballots to be separated into lots to be counted, after
the polls are closed, without unfolding them * * *
"The constitutional amendments under which the Davis
bill is projected allows the Legislature to declare the popula
tion of counties and cities arbitrarily and conclusively, so that
any small county or city desiring to get the immediate bene
fit of the bill has only to have its name inserted in the bill as
containing the requisite population "
WORKING TO SAVE THE FORESTS
The California Club, a local organization of women, has
broadened the crusade which it began for the preservation of
the Calaveras grove in the interest of the general reservation
of the ; forest lands on the public domain, and its president,
Mrs Lovell White, is gathering statistics relating to the cost
of caring for and renewing forest lands in other countries as
a basis on which action may be taken here To this club is
due the credit for the initiative taken for the saving of the
sequoias One of its members, Mrs A D Sharon, made a
special trip to Washington, D C, last year for that purpose
The club has since been in direct correspondence with mem
bers of both houses of Congress to enlist their support to any
reasonable measure that will save the sequoias from destruc
tion Pledges of support have been received from each mem
ber'of the California delegation
Resolutions which have originated in the club will be in
troduced in the the State Legislature during the present ses
sion by Senator John F Davis of Amador and Assemblyman
H W Brown of San Mateo, urging Congress to act expedi
tiously on the bill pending before it providing for the transfer
of the Yosemite National Park These joint resolutions will
be backed, it is representated, by the indorsement of at least
100,000 citizens, whose signatures have been obtained by the
members of the club The efforts of these energetic women
are sure to receive the approval of the public generally — S

SNOWED IN
A Vivid Account of the Trip of a Puien
ger Train on Hew Year'i-
The following account of the trip of
a passenger train through the recent
storm In northern California was writ
ten for the Ledger by one of the pass
engersPersonal """''
"The snow had begun In the gloaming
And busily all the night
Had been heaping field and highway
With a silence deep and white"
The "beautiful snow" began to fall
as we crossed the line which marks the
northern boundary of California, and
everything indicated a big storm on
New Year's night
Train 16, southbound, left Ashland,
Oregon, on the afternoon of Jan 2d,
headed by four powerful engines and
followed by a fifth The snow became
deeper and deeper as we ascended the
heavy grade of the Siskiyou mountains,
but the snow plow was ahead, and, with
Its long line of puffing engines, was cut
ting a wide swath in the light snow
At the summit the tops of fence posts
were just visible, "and still fluttered
down the snow"
There was something strangely quiet
about everything The usual roar of
the train was deadened so that one
could easily imagine he was being drawn
over the snow in a sleigh It was down
grade from the summit to Ager Cali
fornia, so we slid along and enjoyed tho
beautiful Alpine scenery, which was
constantly shifted into moro beautiful
variations than we would attempt to
describe We could look at times down
into gorges of wonderful depth, lined
with trees— each decorated after its own
particular fashion We passed over
several high trestles, which were under
hung with magnificent icicles; and
through deepcuts where the industrious
plow had cut a space just large enough
to allow us to pass through, the snow
being piled high above the coaches on
each side ; 
We reached Agers at 6 o'clock in the
evening, and there we stayed until four
teen hours of the new year had passed
by, waiting for our only hope of deliv
erance, — the snow plow — to get in its
work At 8 o'clock on Thursday morn
ing we had not resumed our journey
As we were due in San Francisco at 8Personal45
a m, according to schedule, it was
time for some of us to begin to get a
trifle impatient The railroad in its
great wisdom follows the rule, "Where
ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wisei "
and gravely informs each anxious in
quirer that "We'll start in about an
hour," which is true, for they set us no
time for the hour to begin It is a par
allel case with the man who leeves the
card, "Back in ten minutes," in his of
fice window So we wait on, and on,
and on, starting up at each whistle
blast, anxiously following the move
ments of all train men, and trying to
catch the meaning of their conversa
tion But after awhile the track was
reported clear, and we started on The'
summit of Shasta mountains was safely
passed and we proceeded on the down
grade to Dunsmulr It is on this grade
that we see the  most beautiful of all
Nature's handiwork combined with the
masterful engineering feats of man As
wo approach the upper crossing of the
Sacramento river we are traveling in a
northerly direction, while directly be
low only a few hundred feet we see the
snow plow forcing its way through the
unbroken crust in the opposite direc
tion The road here makes a complete
"U," going up the east bank and com
ing down the west bank of the river
Bight behind us is train 11, which is
closely followed by train 15, which is
regularly 24 hours behind us So we
are 24 hours late at Dunsmuir
Here we learn that a rotary plow is
ahead, facing a stock train, which is
unable to move forward or backward;
as we know that snow plows do not run
backward, we settle down for the night
The passengers who are fortunate
enough to havo a berth in the sleeper
are comfortable enough, but those who
must lie curled up on a seat and can
sleep only until awakened by a cramp
in the neck, are to be pitied Also the
patient mother with two or three tired
babies to look after Then there are
many who made no provision for a long
trip, either in food or money, and are
compelled to resort to the charity of
the railroad company for the bare
necessities of life
So the hours pass by Morning finds
us still at Dunsmulr Everyone is
straining his ears for the whistle of the
rotary plow which must come up before
we can move The wires are down on
both sides, so the railroad officials are
no wiser than we, and for once their "I
don't know" is true All day long, un
til late in the afternoon we wait as pa
tiently as we can Occasionally the
monotony is broken by a snow fight
among the passengers, and the spirits
of all are temporarily re vlved;but there
is an end to everything, and no one was
sorry when the great rotary plow
steamed in and we heard two blasts
from our engine's whistle
Tho weather became clearer as we
wound around the curves of the Sacra
mento river, and tho full moon broke
through the clouds and gave us a moon
light scene such as one does not often
behold
We were stopped twice by snow slides
before reaching Redding Soon after
entering the Sacramento valley the
snow had entirely vanished and wo pro
ceeded on to the Golden Gate, where
we arrived two days and three hours
late, but with an experience new to
some of us, yet not without its pleasure
if one can find delight in viewing the
most wonderful of Nature's work

CALAVERAS COUNTY
ProspectPersonal The Elva asbestos mine
located near Copperopolis, and  owned
by Chas Rasberry, is at presentat
tracting considerable attention There
is a large body of the asbestos, which
is of long fiber, and promises to be of
considerable value A party of San
Francisco capitalists have recently
been up to look at the property with a
view to purchasing, and it is likely that
adeal will be made, and the mine work
ed on a large scale
The 'Motto' minu belonging to the
company was worked one month and it
proved satisfactory to them, a clean-up
of $1400 being made in the month's run
There is a largo amount of gravel in
sight, to continue operations for many
years In fact it is likely to pay divi-
dends to the company for many ; years
Emery Company is working the
Live Oak quartz mine under a bond
They are sinking a shaft on the mine
which' Is well equipped with steam
hoisting works and other improve
ments ' Drifting aud crosscutting will
be begun as soon as a depth of 200 feet
is reached  Its career is now watched
with interest by owners of otht-r claims
Of the same character and formation
Success in the Live Oak mine will en
courage others to open their mines
The Golden Eagle gravel mine started
up just after the completion of ditches
and pipes, but was closed down owing
to a scarcity of water But they will
resume operations as soon as the storm
comes Last year the mine yielded
$10,000 in gold dust, iv fact it paid
from $80 to $100 a day for about four
months At present they are not
working where they took out that
amount, but will resume operations
there as soon as they work the Reichel
gravel mine out The latter of which
they took hold from the Reichel folks
Is of considerable value It is said that
Reichel took out $90 in three days and
$200 in eight days last spring Ii was
done by hydraulicking process' on a
small scale
There are several other small gravel
mines in the vicinity that are said to
pay their owners well
The Sheperd gravel mine near the
Banner mill is soon to he started by the
Emery Mining Company, under a bond
The Ritter mine has not been worked
since September, but it is understood
that it will start next spring and that
the company will put up a mill and
other necessary improvements on the
property Assays, according to Supt
M C Rigney's statement, average
$1250 to the ton for the vein, including
slate, dike and gouge about twenty-one
feet from wall to wall and the sul
phurets go as high as $200 to the ton
There is every reason to believe Personal that
the mine has permanency There are
about 100 tons of pay rock on the dump
already'    ; " ~^<-,'T
There has been a good deal of  pros- 
pecting and development on the Martha'
quartz mine adjoining the Ritter ' mine
on the south- In the last development
the vein matter is about ten feet from
walr to wall The best pay shoot is
found In the hanging wall and is the
same in character as the Ritter vein
One piece of rock was broken and free
gold was found in it According to de
velopments done, it promises to be as
good as the Ritter mine The owners
are going to run a tunnel on the pay
shoot Th<3 Martha and Ritter mines
are different from all mines in the El
Dorado mining district in character
and format' on ; ->-
CitizenPersonal At the Gwin mine at the
present time eighty stamps are in op
eration and about 10,000 tons of a good
grade of ore are being crushed monthly
The company is getting ready to , sink
for another level below the 1600, and
work on this will commence shortlyPersonal
On the 18th ultimo a dividend of $25,
000 was declared The Gwin is a good
and permanent property *' Personal 5v-

Mining Company's are trying the

In Memoriam
Once more the invisible reaper has
come among us Lynford L Northup
died at his home in Julian district, Dec
30, 1900  In the morning of its career
another heart has ceased to beat and
night came to our young friend ere the
noon of his life was reached However
bard it may be to part with those we
love at anytime, yet to have a dear one
cut off in the morning of his life is
harder still Well may the fond
mother mourn the loss of a son so dear
for he was her pride and joy Well
may brother and sisters bow their
heads in anguish for their bereavement
is great He was esteemed and honor
ed by all who knew him The heart
felt sympathy of the entire community
is extended to thebereaved family
He has drifted away to the unknown shores
Of the spirits eternal home, ''* ; ';'V r '
To the joy's and peace of a better life
Through the depths of the silent tomb;
For the fragrant breath or his pure young life
Was wafted like incense'sweet,
An offering of love and calm repose, , ; t"
To lay at his Savior's feet
While we sigh in vain for a voice and touch
That would ease your heart's deep woe
The light of faith with its sunny rays 
Breaks forth in a golden glow
And brighter forms of the spirit home
O'er the fainting visions soar, ' -' V
Bearing the motto of angel land,
•'Not lost but gone before"

Skagway, Alaska, Dec 21, 1900
Dear LedgerPersonal
The change in thelength of the
days is one of the most interesting
phases of Arctic life Six months ago
the members of the Camera Club were
taking pictures at midnight and it was
impossible to determine where the twi
light of evening ended and that of
morning began Now the sun shines
on the mountain tops about four hours
each day, but on account of the moun
tains that border Lynn canal and Skag
way valley the sun is visible from here
only forty-three minutes each day
The street lights are turned on before
three and are not shut off until after
nine It is like living in another world
to one like Maude who never saw any
winter before She was constantly call
ing my attention to new beauties and
wonders until the novelty was gone
One cold evening it was the sound of
the dry snow underfoot resembling
cornstarch as It slowly yeilded to pres
sure Again, the millions, of minute
cystals, glittering in the keen atmo
sphere as if a shower of diamonds had
fallen Tho wonderful frost work on
the windows, thesharp crackling of the
hair as the comb generates the electric
spauks were hardly less interesting than
the sled and skates of the children, or
the bells worn by horses and dogs as
they drew sleds and sleighs loaded with
wood; merchandise or people Another
novelty not so pleasant was to learn not
to leave liquids overnight, a lesson per
fected by finding a half filled water
bucket ruined by the ice
We have had but little snow as yet in
town; but at White Pass, ten miles
distant in a straight line and in sight,
it snows nearly every day and, as a rule,
the rotary snow plow goes out ahead of
the passenger train every i morning
Altogether the winter is much milder
than I expected, and thus far has not
been as severe as the New England win
ters of my  boyhood experience The
long stormy nights are especially severe
on the sailors, and wrecks of small craft
are frequent, and large vessels are not
safe by any means The "Topeka" is
stUl on the rocks aud much doubt is ex
pressed concerning her being saved A
few light houses would pay for them
selves every year 
A Friend
; Travel over the ice from White
Horse to Dawson has begun and aU in

be the best in the history of Alaska

Ed LedgerPersonal
I would like to ask through
your paper, if any person has the right
to pull up or in any way deface a paling
or any protection, placed around, s
grave in the burial ground in Jackson
During the past summer I, had placed
around the grave of a member of my
family, a small railing, which was put
there as a protection, as the grave had
been repeatedly trampled on by persons
wishing to carry soil from a pile that
had been thrown over the fence ';, You
can imagine my surprise and sorrow
last Saturday, on visiting the grave,
to find the railing all torn up and
thrown up against the adjoining f ence,
and the few flowers that had been 
placed there, nearly ruined I had
tried hard the past few years to keep
the graves of my dear ones in the best
manner my means would allow, but it
is rather hard work when  I find my
labor destroyed

LOSTKin's Richard In a Kitchen
"Actors of the old school did not
have the gorgeous stage settings of the
present" said a veteran stage manager
the other night as he gazed at the stage
in Ford's Opera House while in a
reminiscent mood "I remember once
we were playing southern towns with
Edwin Booth and wanted to put on
'Richard 11'   No special scenery was
carried for this, and I was told to look
over the stock at the theater to see if
there was any that could be used
The second scene called for the en
trance of the king and all his couriers
into a royal hall I picked out a Bet
of scenery that I thought would do
for the palace, but cautioned the stage
hands not to get It on wrong side out
Well, the first scene was finished, and
when the stage was disclosed for the
second there was the typical old kitch
en scene, the one with hams hanging
from the rafters, a candlestick on the
mantel and all that I was horrified
and asked Mr Booth if we should
change it by ringing down the curtain
He said no, he would go on, but he
cautioned the other players to 'keep
your eyes on me; don't under any con
sideration look behind you at the scen
ery'
; "Well, the scene went off, and after
ward, when I asked some of those In
the front of the house, they made no
comment and I was convinced that In
the Intensity of the acting they had not
noticed that the king was In the kitch
en Instead of the palace"— Baltimore

Kept the Bonnet Company,
The story of an elderly couple who
lived In a Massachusetts town nearly
50 years ago is told by some of the old
est Inhabitants with much unction
The lady had been bereft of one help
meet, and her second husband had
twice been left a widower before the
pair were united In the bonds of mat
rimony They were both ofthat tem
perament which causes its possessor to
be characterized as "set"
On the wedding day the bride found
in the, back entry, on 'a conspicuous
nail, a sunbonnet which had belonged
to her immediate predecessor She re
moved it to oblivion In a closet
Her newly wedded husband made no
comment, but replaced the sunbonnet
on its accustomed nalL '
During the next few days the calico
headgear vibrated with more or less
regularity between the closet and the
nail , Then there came a day when the
bride approached her husband with a
man's bat in her hand as he was In the
act of reinstalling the sunbonnet
"If you have that sunbonnet thepe,"
she said firmly, "I shall hang up my
first husband's hat on the next nail"
She looked at the bridegroom and
met  the counterpart of her own ex
pression She hung the bat on the des
ignated nail, and, although the two
people lived to be very old, neither the
hat nor the sunbonnet ever moved
again till the house -came into the

When be reached the lighthouse, he
was warmly greeted "Come in the

after the rescuer had warmed himself
"Come in and have dinner with us"

needed food," stammered Mr Dorr as

got off the train, he looked up Captain
Warren Moseley, one of the bravest of

On the first day of the battle of Win
chester a Yankee was killed so near
the line of battle that a soldier of the
tinine of McLendon, Company I, Fourth
Georgia, picked up the hat* and put' It
on and wore It He had not had it on
his head for more than two hours when
be was sliottlirough the head, the bul
let piercing the hat in almost the same
hole that the bullet had entered that
killed the Yankee
Another soldier of the name of Woo
ten of Company H, Fourth Georgia,
picked up the bat and put it on, and in
less than an hour he, too, was killed,
the bullet striking him in the head near
the place where the other two bullets
had entered
The next day another soldier of the
name of KHpatrick of Company H,
Fourth Georgia, was wearing the hat
when be, too,' was struck In the head
and killed >
Although the bat was a fine one, It
was left lying on the field, as there

Cyclone Pranks
A traveler In the west, the Rev C T

an earthquake down, a cyclone is the
most appalling The midnight black
ness of the funnel, the lightning dart

the strange crackling sound from its
bosom, the suddenness of its irresisti
ble attack, its incredibly swift motion,
its wild leaping and bounding, like a
gigantic beast of prey, the awful roar
which follows, all this but feebly char
acterizes that strange ravager of the
plains He continuesPersonal
; The cyclone plays odd pranks I
have seen two horses lifted In air and
carefully deposited, unharmed, In a

I have seen chickens and geese ploked
clean of feathers and yet feebly alive

ten feet in diameter cut out of Its roof,

Boston's "Little Italy"
The Boston Transcript says that Bos

and whence he bore the message of

eign faces and tongues The Old North
church Itself cannot have far to go
to neighbor with Franciscan chapels
and Roman Catholic cathedrals, the
whole medley of a foreign world usurp
ing that place where once Puritanism
reigned supreme
' They say that the Boston Italians are
very thrifty, that from being good rent
payers they are becoming notable prop
erty buyers They are a music loving
and art loving people "Go to the
Museum of Fine Arts on the free days

"Didn't dare," I answered "I knew
it was more dangerous to run away
than to go forward"
"Reminds me of a story," said he,
smiling "Years ago there was a bully
In Sangamon county, Ills, that had the
reputation of running faster and fight
ing harder than any other man there
Everybody thought he was a terrible
fighter He'd always get a man on the
run; then he'd catch up and give him a
licking One day he tackled a lame
man- The lame man licked him In a
minute
" 'Why didn't ye run? somebody
asked the victor "

when he tackled me, an I've been lame

Poor Richard's Bread Box
Benjamin Kranklln was a hearty eat
er In the good old days before the
vending of lightning rods became j a
profession When history caught one
of her first glimpses of him, he was
eating a roll In the street After he
laid the cornerstone of the Pennsyl
vania hospital In the happy reign of
George 11, he was a frequent visitor In
the halls of that institution His la
bors there being arduous, it chanced
that he frequently fell hungry at work
He appeared at the hospital gate
one day with a big tin box under his
arm Disregarding the gaze of the cu
rious, he marched through the cor
ridors to the dispensary, brushed aside
a few cobwebbed beakers from a shelf
and in their place planted the tin box
" "What might this be?" queried his
friend Dr Rush
"This," said Ben Franklin, "Is Poor
Richard's bread box Help yourself"
The box was filled with penny cakes
When the supply ran out, Ben Frank
lin bought more takes That was 150
years ago
• Since Franklin's time, new hospital
buildings have crowded the old out
of existence and the hospital has
grown to be one of the most noted In
the world Yet an old tin box, much
battered and dented, stands on a shelf
in the drug room, and it contains cakes
and ginger snaps Whenever the resi
dent physicians or nurses visit the
room they go to the box, take out a
cake and eat When the cakes are
gone, the hospital steward charges the
box afresh— Philadelphia Press
A Witty Irishman
Some friends of Archbishop Whately,
after dining with him, asked him to
show them a specimen of Irish wit
Taking a stroll In the street, he Inquir
ed of a crossing sweeper which of the
two the devil would take if he was
obliged to secure one of them
"Prase, yer rlverence, ask Father
Malony yonder"
"No; I want your opinion"
"Och, yer rlverence, I'm sorry to say
he'd take me!" \
"And why so, Terence?"
"Och, because he's sure of yer rlver
ence at any time!"
Try It
One can hear better with the mouth
open than shut, a fact which may be
verified by stopping the ears while
passing through a railway tunnel and
alternately opening and shutting one's

Made It Fit the Name
"Bed Rock, N V," said a man who
spent some time there, "Isn't much of
a place, but there is something inter
esting about It that I fancy all the
world doesn't know The present name
Personal< not the one It has always borne, and
what its other name was I don't know
Whatever it was the people fiid not
1I1=- it and  concluded they would
change It There was no particular
reason why they, should call It Ked
Hock, but that- was determined upon,
and so Red Rock It became ' 
"Then In the course of time strangers
of an Inquiring turn of mind began to
ask why the place had such a name,
and as no reason could be given new
comers to the neighborhood began to
want a name that meant something
Tills Insistence grew so strong that the
old residents began to look around for
a reason for the name of their place,
and at last they found a huge bowlder
near by which they said was what had
suggested the name But the bowlder
was gray instead of red, and the pro
gressists Insisted that that would not
do At last the old timers hit upon a
new plan, and, procuring a barrel of red
paint, they painted the big rock red
Red Rock Indeed It was now,' and not
only was all opposition to the name
overcome, but the painting of the rock
every spring baa become an annual
festival, and the people celebrate It
with a big picnic and general celebra

Cock Shooting In Tall Corn
Cock Bhoo"nsr in tall corn is as easy
to the exp s It Is puzzling to the
novice You will, of course, work with
the rows, not across them, and if you
are wise you will shoot at every
glimpse of a bird and very frequently
nfter an Instant's sight of him when
you can only guess where he Is Sharp
work, say ye, my masters Yes In a
measure, but not so wonderful after all
You certainly must be ever ready and
swift and smooth In action, but actual
sight of th<> bird at the Instant of pull-
Ing trlff™-  '• not necessary
Green  "| won't stop even fine shot
and your charge will give a pattern as
big as a bushel basket; hence the shak
ing of a leafli the flick of a vanishing
wing, are enough for the master of the
art In an instant his gun is on the
spot where a species of lightning cal
culation tells him the bird should be,
and the trigger Is pressed without the
slightest delay The diflJculty with the
novice is to get him to shoot at once in
stead of ' waiting in vain for a clear
view Experts kill bird after bird In
this way The novice must dismiss all
thoughts of empty shells No good
sportsman worries over misses! though
he will learn from failures how to hold
next time There is no royal road to
success In the field Nothing but ex
perience really counts" So let the nov
ice crack away, although he may only
get one bird In ten We all know what
he'll get If he doesn't shoot at all—

His Impressive Looks
Trumbull's cradle was in Connecti
cut He came of the old Jonathan
Trumbull, breed As a young man he
went south to teach school, but he
liked it not and dipped into lawbooks
As soon as he was equal to bis exam
ination he was called to the Georgia
bar, but he never paused to practice
there He migrated to Illinois, then
the utter west and settled at Belle
ville, St Clalr county, in that part of
the state known as Egypt
' There be at once took a leading place
at the bar He was always courtly, al
ways carefully polite, what one might
call a bit cold, yet be had great sway
with the Juries He was a clear, cogent
reasoner and had a trick of admon
ishing with his forefinger Sometimes
it would seem as If that potent forefin
ger wove a spell I doubt not it has
brought many a jury in its 'time to
Trumbull's side of the question
Such were the impressive looks of
Trumbull that I recall what Governor
Reynolds once said of him as he closed
his argument in a law case Trumbull
was on the other side
"And now, gentlemen," said Reyn
olds as he prepared to closePersonal "I've an
swered his arguments, I've overturned
his statement of facts, I've undone the
fallacious law he has announced to
you; but, gentlemen, the man never
lived who can reply to his looks!"— Ch

"You are in the right place, madam,"
returned the elevator man, who was

A Blgr Grasshopper
A geographical expedition which set
out for Australia from Boston on an
exploring and mapmaklng tour had en
gaged a negro cook, who took great in
terest in everything he saw While the
party was en route a kangaroo broke
out of the grass and made for the hori
zon with prodigious leaps, an event
that interested the colored gentleman
from the Hub exceedingly
"You all have pretty wide meadows
hereabouts, I reckons," he said to the
native who was guiding the party
"Not any larger than those of other
countries," returned the guide most po
litely
"Well, there must be mighty power
ful high grass roundabouts; heh?" he
insisted   •
"Not that I know of," replied the
guide "Why do you ask such odd

Knocks Their Shoes Off
Strange as it may seem, people kill
ed in a railroad wreck are generally
bereft of their shoes by the shock In
commenting on this peculiarity an old
railroad engineer saidPersonal "A man who is
killed in a railroad accident seldom
dies with his boots on I don't know
why this should be, but it is a fact It
is particularly true in the case of a
man who is struck by an engine aiid
killed In nine cases out of ten, when
the body Is picked up, it will be found
minus shoes Even men wearing heavy
top boots are not exempt from this
strange rule Why is it? I guess you'll
have to ask somebody who is wiser
than I am,"— Philadelphia JRecord,
Clothes and the Man
; If a ; Filipino' enters] the house of a
European j living In 'an unassuming
way, he' will not believe that the Eu
ropean is either wealthy or wise, and,
although his manner' may be correct
it will not be humble On the other
band, if he visits an Ignorant man
who Indulges In great splendor, he will
at once become exceedingly respectful
Mr Phelps Whitmarsh, who In The
Outlook gives his experiences in the
Islands, tells the story of a wealthy
provincial ' Visiting Manila for the first
time, 'who asked to be presented to the
povernor general
When he reached • the  palace, he
found the governor taking coffee on
bis piazza, dressed comfortably ' In a
white cotton suit^ The- Filipino re
quested that some favor be m tended
to his district and his request was
granted He then withdrew The offi
cial who had procured the presenta
tion asked him what be thought of the
general T \ S3
"Why," replied the visitor in a tone
of disappointment "he Is no different
from any other white man"
It so happened that the general was
told of the incident and he gave or
ders that at his next reception the
Filipino should be present
Upon entering the tbroneroom and
seeing the general in full ; uniform,
surrounded by bis brilliant staff, with
the accessories of splendid tapestries,
laced ushers and ' all the pomp and
splendor of these Spanish functions,
the provincial grew pale and, kneeling
In deep humility, exclaimedPersonal
"This is indeed my general!"
So impressed was he that the fol
lowing morning he sent a pair of hand
some horses to the general with a note
which readPersonal
"My general, yesterday I liked* yon
so much In your uniform of gold that
I send you this pair of horses, but do
not use them when you j dress In a
white suit" • -
Mirror Had
"What!" exclaims the astonished
reader, "is it possible that there are
any civilized persons on the face of the
earth who are not hi the habit* of be
bolding their visages' reflected from
time to time in anjlrror'of some kind?
Surely this j cannot be \eo," Wrong,
quite wrong, gentle reader, for at the
present time, strange as It may ap
pear, there are -hundreds of men and
women in the United Kingdom who
have not gazed into a mirror for years'
The convicts confined In British pris
ons form members of this community
From the moment of 'a convict's en
trance to a jail to the moment of his
exit he is not permitted to have the
use of a mirror of any kind, the small
est piece of glass being rigidly denied
him To tlv> women convicts this ab-'
sence of a mirror forms one' of the
chief hardships of confinement; and'
many a female warder can tell piteous
tales of women who have actually fall
en upon tlieir knees and sobbed out
entreaties for the loan of a morsel of
mirror— "just for a second" All these
entreaties have perforce to be disre
garded, and It therefore comes about
that many a female convict passes
three or four years without being per
mitted to gaze upon her own features

He Got a Pass*
"Halt!" cried an alert patrolman In
Manila as a beautifully caparisoned
carriage drove up containing a portly
gentleman The driver reined his
steeds, and the sentry, standing firmly
in the center of the street, shouted
"Who is there?"
j Not knowing, what else to say, the
occupant of the carriage answered,
"Judge Taft, president of the civil
commission"
"Advance, "Judge Taft to be recog
nized," bawled the sentry The Judge
advanced, and the following dialogue
took placePersonal
; Sentry— Have you a pass? ; 
Taft— No, sir; do I require one?* 
Sentry— You do sir and it's my duty
to run you in -
Taft— But I am the civil governor of
the Philippine Islands
 Sentry— That doesn't cut any figure
You're a civilian and out after hours
I'll let you go by this time, but the next
time I catch you you'll have to see the
captain"
"Thank you," murmured Judge Taft
as be drove away And there and then
he formed a resolution to put in an
application for a pass According to
the Manila Freedom, he got It
