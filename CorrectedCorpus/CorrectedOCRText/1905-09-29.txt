Funcions of Conenience
These relae o he care, mainen
ance and use of public srees', which
include sidewalks, bridges and

should bo drained, and curbs, guers

Funcions of Public Safey
Under his head may be considered Personal
Fire proecion, police proecion
and healh proecion jjS?
One o he firs needs of an urban
communiy is proecion agains fire
This he couny canno gie Wih
ou nsurance raes will be exhor
bian In unincorporaed owns
here is almos inariably an inade
quae fire proecion and consequen
al high insurance raes The fire de
parmens, such as s, is mainain
ed a he expense of he few who
happen o be on hand when he
collecion is aken up, and here again
comes he inequaliy of sacrifice for
he public good
Furhermore, here is always an ab
sence of regulaions o operae o
preen fires Fire rap buildings are
pu up In dangerous localiies, rub
bish accumulaes in back alleys and
eeryhing inies an early and dam
aging conflagraion The municipal
corporaion alone has ' auhoriy o
adop preenaie measures, and
hose measures are more aluable
han a lire deparmen
The more populous a communiy
he greaer necessiy is here for
police proecion cs which, in a
rural communiy affec none bu ihe
doer, in a populous' communiy be
comes highly obnoxious o neigh
bors Such acs mus be legislaed
agains and punished, and here again
he municipaliy becomes a necessiy
The public healh is of grae con
cern and s he urban communiy
ha is mos suscepible o all forms
of disease I is here ha epidemics
raage and ake away our loed ones
s in ne ciies ha disease
breeds and sars ou o deal deah o
he liing, he srong and he beau
iful
Modern science is deoing iself o
he preenion of disease as much as
s o is cure
Cleanliness is he secre of healh
The law has been wrien "ciies
mus keep clean " No' own, no maer
how small, can iolae his law and
escape wih immuniy I is recogn
ized ha he arious feers are race
able o filh, and ha epidemiccs of
his disease can be aoided simply by
keeping clean
Therefore we mus hae pure waer,
unconaminaed by filh, pure air,
unpollued by noxious gases, and o
hae pure waer and pure air we mus
no permi filh o accumulae
Therefore we mus hae sewers and
such healh ordinances as will main
ain he healh of he communiy
The rubbish of he sree, ana he
household 'wase, mus be remoed so
ha i will no be a source of danger
The municipal corporaion alone
has he only ample auhoriy o pro
ec he public healh
Indusrial Funcions
Ciies are rapidly aking upon hem
seles new funcions of an indusrial
naure 'They are operaing waer
works, ligh plans, sree railways,
ec  book could be wrien on his
subjec alone and he adanages of
municipal operaion porrayed 
few words here mus suffice I is
generally conceded and saisics
show, ha municipal waer works
resul in purer waer, beer supply,
beer fire proecion, cheaper raes,
•ower cos
The same can be said of he muni
cipal lighing works Oer 10 ciies
in his sae operae waer works and
a dozen operae waer lighing works
Social  Funcions
For he social beermen of a com
muniy ciies can mainain parks and
playgrounds, gymnasiums and bahs,
libraries, museums and ar galleries,
proide concers and oher forms of
enerainmen and recreaion While
hese hings, are no essenial, hey
sere a high and noble purpose and
he communiies who wish o reach
a high plane of social comfor mus
hae hem and secure hem hrough
he effors of he municipaliy The
public library is a ery popular and
useful insiuion, and no ciy is oo
small o mainain one  There are
abou fify municipal libraries in
California and he number is con
sanly increasing In one insance
he main incenie for he incorpor
aion of a own was he desire of is
people o hae a public library
Wha he danage Cos
Haing enumeraed he arious
benefis ha a communiy may ob
ain, he nex imporan hing o be
considered is he cos of he same I
is a rule of human acion ha we
canno saisfy our desires wihou a
sacrifice We mus pay he price for
all ha we need for our physical and
social enjoymen  municipaliy
can supply cerain • coneniences,
necessiies and comfors, and a com
muniy can, by paying he price, ake
lile or all ha i can supply I is
like a sore wih is,'sock of merchan
dise, wherein a person may ake one
aricle or he enire sock, if he is
willing o pay or i Some commu
niies require lile, ohers desire
much Ho ax raes ary ram a nom
inal sum o an amoun ha some ax
payers may consider exraagance
The insan a municipaliy corpora
ion is organized he erriory is
wihdrawn from he jurisdicion of
he couny auhoriies The care of
he highways passes from he couny
o he municipaliy, and likewise he
reenue for he care of roads goes o
he municipal reasury No road ax
is leied on he propery in incorpor
aed owns lso, under a recen de

in a'few a smaller rae ye
So in deciding upon be quesion o
incorporaion he maer is no one of
increasing he ax rae, ba s of
deermining wheher or no all of he
adanages of municipal cooperaion
will be on ap, wheher we wish o
pay he price or no In oher words,
we are o lay in a sock of sewers, fire
apparaus, waer works, lighing

We may no wish muny of hese for

horoughly posed oh he opics ol

I plainly says ha oer expansion in
