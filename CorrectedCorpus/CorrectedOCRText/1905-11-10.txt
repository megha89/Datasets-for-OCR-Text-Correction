HOW UNCLE SM
PYS HIS EBTS
By IIOX ELLIS If ROBERS
(Formerly Treasurer of h? Unied Saes)
Why should' Undo Sam, rich as he
is, be in deb a all?
I cos a largo sum o se up for
hinsel, oen i he did fail o pay
some of he coninenal currency
issued o carry on he Reoluion
ie had o defend he froniers from
Indians, and o proec sailors' righs
on hifih seas by he war of 1812 To
keep is saes ogeher srained his
muscles and his iesources, and he
Ciil Wai closed wih a deb on his
shoulders monsrous in is magniude,
and wih a buiden of pensions o be
measured by he beneUcence of he
riumph Personal'Personal•;
iiesides, he bough land, a as em
pire from France, some irom Mexico
besides spoils of war, laska from
Kussia, and Florida, Poro Rico and
he Philippines from Spain Nor
was Hawaii annexed wihou expense
He los money by deposiing funds
wih he saes He recoered wih
ineres he credis he adanced o
he Pacific railioads, and now hu is
on he Cenral merican ishmus,
saring in ias a canalbuilder on a
grand scale The years hae been
few in which he has le his oulay
run ahead of his income, and hese,
wih rare excepions, were during
war imes • "
When he firs sared business for
himself under he Consiuion, in
1789, Uncle Sam assumed a deb o
§71,<X)0,508 for he cos of he Reo
luion, and he had no a cen in he
reasury Necessiy compelled him
o borrow a once for curren use,
so ha he owed in 1791 §75,63,77
This burden was reduced 0515,209,738
in 1812, before he second war wih
Orea Briain Hy 1816 i had been
carried' up o 8217,33,93 This
whole deb was wiped ou by 1836,
when i sood a he nominal figures
of 837,513 There was gradual in
crease o 832,72,922 in 183
WHT THE WRS COST
The war wih Mexico soon came,
and he figures wih flucuaions ran
as high as 568,30,79> in 1851 Our
maximum ne indebedness was lifed
by he Ciil War o 82,756,31,57
ugus, 1H65
Theu reducions were made year by
year wih occasional ariaions, so
ha he amoun, less cash in reasury,
was 51,175,168,675 in 1887, and 8838,
969,7575 in 1893  period of ad
diion followed, and beore he war
wih Spain, in pril, 1898, he figures
became 81,018,32,652 For ha war
a loan o 8200,000,000 was iesued,
which raised he deb, June 30, 1899,
o 81,155,320,235 By paymens his
soon began o grow less, and June 30,
190b, i was 8909,17,625
These formidable figures proe
ha Uncle Sam does acually pay his
deJbls He had pracically seled in
full all nis accouns up o 1836 By
1891 ho had canceled a billion and
hreequarers of he giganic expend
iures for he Ciil War The echoes
of he guns a Saniago and Manila
had no ceased beore he began o
buy his own bonds in adance of
mauriy He is ready o pay or he
Panama Canal and ihe equiies o
Columbia ou of his saings, and o
go on wih he grea work of connec
ing he wo oceans nefoie he borrows
an addiional dollar
Grea Briain has a differen
periods made emporary reducions
in is indebedness, only o add again
o he magniude France heroically
canceled is war indemniy o Ger
many Ye no one of he goern
mens of he Old World expecs eer
o balance is books free from deb
The financial obligaions o eery one
of hem are planned o be perpeual
This mus be so, because he deb of
European counries bear so large a
raio o heir wealh and populaions
For each of is inhabians France
in 1903 carried a deb of 515160,
Spain of 81088; he Unied King
dom of 89629; Russia in Europe,
83135; usriaHungary, 8232; Ger
many, because France paid he cos
of he war of 1870, 81051 Of Briish
colonies, usralia owes 8250 for each
person, and Canada 850 By conras
he Unied Saes is indebed only
51138 for each person
Measured by he esimaed woih
of is propery, he deb of France
was 119 per cen, of is wealh; of
Gormany, 773 per cen ; Russia, 10
per cen ; of he Unied Kingdom,
625; of usralia, 18 per cen, and
of Canada, 509 per cen ; bu he
raio of be deb of he Unied Saes
o is wealh is only nineyseen one
hundredhs o one per cen
If Uncle Sam were o draw on he
saingsbanks, heir deposis in he
single sae of New l'ork, or  per
cen, of heir deposis in he counry
as a whole, would pay all ho owes,
and 36 per cen, of he deposis of
be naional banks would perform be
same ask I would ake only 29per
cen, of he alue of farms o offse
all his bonds
The expors of agriculural pro
ducs for a single year are enough o
cancol all his obligaions The public
lands which belong o him, unappro
priaed and ouside of he reser
aions, no including he Philippines,
would, if sold a 8103 an acre, pay
eery dollar of his Indebedness
Thus be burden of Uncle Sam's
deb is ligh by eery comparsion
Ho colleced reenues in 1866 amoun
ing o 81573 o each person o he
populaion If he should collec in
he samn raio now, he could cancel
all bis bonds in sixeen monhs, be
sides meeing all expenses, and so
wipe his slae clean \V

American Cow Stables Up to Average
In the stabling and general care of
dairy cows no foreign country shows,
in general practice, any methods or
conditions better than our own. While
the average conditions throughout the
country are undoubtedly far from
what they should be, the United States
MODEL CO-OPERATIVE FRENCH

farmer and dairyman are making as
rapid strides forward as can be found
anywhere.
Major -Alvord found comparatively
few places in Holland and Switzerland
where there is such close relationship
between the dairy cows and families
as the occupancy of connecting apart
ments, so often described in poetic
fancy by European travelers. These
GUY ELLIOTT MITCHELL
conditions do exist abroad— where the I
cow is taken in as a member of the
family — as they do in no place in the
United States, but they are the excep
tion. Stables which in summer are
converted into conservatories ' and
rooms for weaving and cheese curing
are the unusual and show places. The
construction of cow stables generally in
the dairy countries of the Old World ,
is of a substantial nature, with little'
regard paid to light and ventilation,
COMBINED DWELLING AND COW STABLE IN DENMARK-STABLE IN FRONT
conveniences of arrangement or ease
in cleaning. While much attention is
paid to cleaning cow stables, it is ap
parently more from an appreciation of
the value of the manure than from an
effort to have sanitary conditions in
the dairy.
Foreigners Provide Good Feed.
There is one thing where Europeans
may be ahead -of Americans. They
seem to **c better versed in the feeding
of cattle. Even the poorest > peasants
do not hestitate to purchase concentra
ted cattle foods where necessary, yet it
appears that the only reason the na
tives can give for this practice is the
stereotyped answer: — "My father did
so." . :^
The American farmer. Major Alvord
thought, has undoubtedly a much more
intelligent knowledge of the principles
of feeding, but there is probably more
carelessness and waste in feeding ani
mals of all kinds in America than any
where else in the world, ; •
The most astonishing feature of Eu
rope in the care of milk on the farm is
the entire absence of refrigeration in
France, and the general ignoring of
the value of cold in dairying. In the
matter of dairy appliances and equip
ment, the United States is surpassed,
by no other country, although Den
mark and parts of Great Britain stand
about as well.
In most big cities of Europe there
are a few well-conducted milk delivery
establishments, such as are usually
found in our smallest cities, while in
some localities dairy animals are
driven through the streets and milked
at customers' doors. Milch cows are
managed in the same way even in the
best streets of Paris -J and of, Rome.
Paris probably has the poorest milk
service of any of the large cities. Dur
ing the Exposition at Paris in July,
1900, a special show of perishable dairy
products was held as an annex to that
exposition..
Paris Milk Exhibit Very Poor.
While the French producers had
every opportunity of exhibiting their
goods in the best possible shape, the
only samples of natural milk and
cream, absolutely free from chemical
preservatives and uncooked, which
were sweet and palatable after noon
of the exhibition day, were from the
dairies in New York and New Jersey,
then eighteen days from the cow! The
American products had been preserved
solely by cleanliness and cold. Major
Alvord made the statement on his re
turn from Europe that no milk-supply
company in Europe could duplicate this
performance.
In butter-making, while there is am
pie room for improvement in our coun
try, the only foreign country from
which the United States can possibly,
learn anything. is Denmark. There the*
best creameries are models of cleanli
ness, good order, and systematic man
agement But all these details are ac
complished only through a lavish ex
penditure of labor which would appal
an American creamery manager. It is
not an uncommon thing for six or
eight <■ persons to be constantly em
ployed for six or eight hours a day,
turning out a quantity of butter which
is ordinarily made in this country by
a man and a boy whe have all the work
finished daily at 3 or 4 o'clock in the
afternoon.
Major Alvord found it impossible to
draw any comparisons between the
methods of cheese-making and the re
sults in this country and those abroad.
It is believed that the American ' fac
tory system, common to the United
States and Canada, is superior to any
thing elsewhere. In variety and fancy
cheese this continent' can not yet at-
tempt to compete with the Old World.
In order to learn the bottom facts
about making any of the famous spe
cialties in cheese, it is necessary to go
to the locality where they originate.
Making Dairy Work Popular..
Americans find novelty in Europe in
the "fairs" and "markets" where prod
ucts of the dairy are sold to the highest
bidder. In Normandy the wives and
daughters of farmers and peasants as
semble by the hundred in the parks or
along the streets, selling their
"mottes" of butter. The cheese fairs
of Frome, England, and Kilmarnock,
Scotland, and the street markets of
Alkmaar, Hoorri; and Utrecht, Holland,
also present lively alid interesting
spectacles in connection- with the sale
of dairy products.
Major Alvord's observations show
that while too much can not be said
of the industry, frugality and thrift of
Europe's dairymen, a close comparison
leads one to feel that the conditions of
the industry in the United States are
decidedly more satisfactory in almost
every particular.
Wholesome Cider Vinegar.
In an ordinary cheap restaurant the
safest thing tojdo if you wish to use
some vinegar on~your food is to try and
get half a lemon. Then you will know
that you are not eating out the lining
of your stomach with caustic chemi
cals. Vast quantities of "pure cider
vinegar" "are quite innocent of the
meaning of apples and are distinctly
injurious, being purchased by the re
tail dealer in barrels, at seven to ten
cents a gallon, which every apple grow
er knows is a prohibitive price for
cider vinegar.  However, real ci-Jer
vinegar is a good condiment. The rea
son it can not be sold for the prices at
which chemical vinegar is offered' is
that it takes from one to three years
to make properly.
The cider first must go through the
process of alcoholization, and then be
changed into acetic acid. There are
methods of artificially hastening this
process, but the product is not first
class, and it can only be done on a
