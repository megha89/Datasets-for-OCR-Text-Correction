AGGITATING IRRIGATION.
The Strength of the Newspaper Seeog
nized as an Importance.
It lies largely with the western press
to Say what shall be done by Congress
for the West. Western papers are of
course for anything that is a benefit to
the west, but so long as they advocate
western measures fn a desultory and
disorganized manner, they cannot ac
complish the results that can be attain
ed by a combined and surtained effort.
Some time ago western papers com
menced vigorously agitating the water
question. Everybody has always
known of course that the .West is de
pendent upon water, but in showing
wbTat'mighi be done with more water
and in continually urging the vital im
portance of the question to the country
and the necessity for Congress taking
some action on a brqpd national basis
for irrigation development, such inter
est has been aroused that the whole
question has now been forced to the
front and' is now recognized as one
which must be reckoned upon at ! each
session of Congress and which cannot
be suppressed. This is' primarily the
result of newspaper^ agitation and the
newspapers of the West now hold the
key to'the position*  "
The situation in Congress is such
that if a united demand is made by the
West for irrigation appropriations it
cannot bo refused. There is no ques
tion of this fact. The trouble has been
in the past that the West has not been
thoroughly united upon this proposi
tion. The West holds the power in
Congress if it will stand unitedly and
exercise it.
And if Western newspapers-the city
papers, the country papers, the dailies
and the weeklies — will print arguments
and demands that Congress shall con
sider this great question of irrigation
as a national question, not print one
article oh the subject, but keep contin
ually driving at the idea that the ques
tion is the one most vital thing to the
entire West, the one question, which if
acknowledged by Congress will change
millions of acres of waste and barren
places into smiling fertility and wealth,
then it will take Western Senators and
Congressmen long to see that this is a
question upon which they must unite
to a man, and with a united western
delegation the battle is won. 'This is
the power which the western press
possesses.^ ,

RURAL DELIVERY SERVICE
Instructions From the De-
partment.
HOW TO OBTAIN RURAL FREE DELIVERY SERVICE
The Form of Petition Used and the
Method of Procedure Upon
Application.
In response to numerous inquiries the
following instructions have been issued
from the Post Office Department at
Washington by the First Assistant
Postmaster GeneralPersonal ,
HOW TO OBTAIN RURAL FREE DE-
LIVERY.
Present a petition, addressed to the
first Assistant Postmaster General,
signed by those who desire the service.
This petition 6hould be signed only by
heads of families, and should mention
the number in each family. It should
set forth the nature of the country
where the delivery is desired, whether
densely or sparsely populated, the prin-'
cipal avocations of the people, ' the
the character of the roads, and the
distances which, under existing con
ditions, each patron has to travel to re
ceive his mail, and should be accom
panied, wherever possible, by a rough
map indicating the route or routes pro
posed. - L
This petition, when properly signed,
should bo Bent to your Representative)
in Congress, or to one of your Senators
with a request that he endorse thereon
his recommendation of the service
asked, and forward the petition to the
Department.
CONDITIONS OF THE SERVICE.
It must be borne in mind that the In
tention of Congress in authorizing the
free delivery of malls in rural districts
was not to grant a suburban delivery
to cities included in the Free Delivery
Service, nor to establish a village free
delivery. The purpose of the Rural
Free Delivery System is to give postal
facilities to those who have none; to
carry the mails daily to remote rural
communities, the residents of which
would otherwise have to travel from
two to twelve miles to receive their
letters and newspapers.
The roads must be good. This is an
essential pre-requisite to any investiga
tion.
No route can be established that is less
than from twenty^ to twenty-five miles
in length, or which serves less' than 100
families.
The route should be so arranged that
the carrier will not be required to
travel over the same ground twice on
the same day. Those desiring the de
livery must be prepared to put. up,' at
their own expense, at some convenient
location which can be reached by the
carrier without dismounting from his
buggy, appropriate and secure boxes
for the reception of the U. S. mails.
Rural carriers are not required to de
liver mail to houses standing back from
the main road. The service is one of
mutual accommodation, and the pa
trons are expected to meet the Depart
ment half way in affording facilities for
its establishment.
FORM OF PETITION.
As an indication of the form of appli
cation which meets the requirements of
the Department the following petition,
upon which Rural Free Delivery Ser
vice was established, from South Whit
ley, Whitley county, Indiana, on Octo
ber 2, 1899, is citedPersonal

graveled and in good condition over the pro
posed route, and they ask for the establishment
ot Rural Free Delivery of malls -for said com
munity over the route described as follows Personal

METHOD OF PROCEDURE.
Upon receipt of a petition, forwarded
and endorsed after the above -model, a
Special Agent is detailed by the Depart
ment to visit the location indicated, to
map out a route or routes, and to select
rural carriers, to be appointed by the
Department. In all such cases the ad
vice of the Representative in Congress,
and also of the Postmaster from whose
office it is proposed that the Rural Free
Delivery should start, is sought and ob
tained. {• •
' Rural carriers give bond in ;the sum
of $500, with two sureties. Each bond
requires a 50-cet)t revenue stamp to be
affixed thereto. v. ;
Carriers are paid by warrants, direct
ly issued by the Treasury Department
upon certificates forwarded {j by the
Postmaster. ..Their rate of pay is fixed
by the Department, and includes horse
hire, but not necessary tolls or ferriage,
for which a separate account must be
rendered. ;"'» . .
One or. more, substitute carriers
should be provided in each case, who
must gi-'H bond in the same sum as the
regular carrier and who alone are per
mitted to carry tho mails in the absence
or disability of the regular carrier.- ; .
Accounts for service must be rendered
in the name of the regular carrier, and
he must pay his substitute a proper pro
rata for the service rendered.
"All rural carriers are under the con
trol of the Postmaster from whose of
fice the service is established, and it is
his duty to report any deselections upon
their part.. ,
Rural carriers will take with them
upon their rounds a supply of stamps,
postal cards, etc. ; will bo authorized to
give receipts for money orders, and if
the patrons of the delivery so desire it,
to inclose the orders, when . granted, in
addressed envelopes- confided to their
charge.
Instructions are in preparation, and
will shortly be issued, authorizing them
to register letters, giving receipts for
the same. -. A. W. Macherl,

X Wasn't the Bell.
The Lewlston (Me.) Journal tells a
story of a minister In a prayer meeting
who cut short "Uncle" Ira, a prosy old
deacon,. by ringing a bell at the end of
five minutes. Bet -after doing so he
felt sorry, because he had apparently
hurt the feelings of an old father in
Israel. So he arose and went down to
"Uncle" Ira nnd pu.t his hand on the
old man's shoulder. Personal'• . .
", 'Uncle' Ira," said be, "I'm sorry for
that. I ask your pardon and"—
" "Uncle" Ira looked up, the anger still
In his eyes.
"Why, ye don't think I set down on
account of that pesky little bell of
your'n, do ye?" he demanded.
"Why, I— l— well, I thought"— stam
mered the minister.
"Waal," said "Uncle" Ira, "ye needn't
think no more about that bell. I want
to tell ye right now that no bells ain't
ever goln" to set me down In this vestry
where I've, talked goin on 29 years. I

The . Various . Claaaea jof Persona In
Great Britain Who Cannot Be Ar
rested — Royalty, aa a- Matter of
Coarse, I* First on the List.
The other - day at the Westminster
(England) county, court a warrant for
the arrest and committal of a solicitor
had . to be extended for four months
more, as, though the solicitor was
walking about the streets in the sight
of (the police, they dared not lay. a fin
ger 1 on him. Even the judge seemed
surprised that the man could not be
arrested, j But It Is probable he never
will, be arrested,  for, as he carries a
charm -on his person In the form of a
brief, his body cannot be seized. This
Is because no one engaged on business
«t;a .Jaw court can' be arrested for any
breach of the clvlOaw." If you happen
to oWe a debt, to have a judgment de
livered against you and to be commit
ted to prison for not paying, of course
you can ' be arrested under ordinary
circumstances, but if you are sub
poenaed as a witness yon cannot be
arrested while 'going to the place,
while staying there to give evidence
or while returning home, and you may
feel sure that the courts will stick up
for you.
There are many other • people who
can lough at the police. Of course no
member of the royal family can be
arrested under' any circumstances.
Servants of the royal household also
have great privileges in this way.
Should one of the royal servants com
mit  a crime at the command of the
crown he could not be arrested. As the
crown can do no wrong, of course any
order the crown should give would be
considered right, and Bobby would not
dare to make an arrest.
Then members of parliament, though
they can be arrested for some things,
are exempt In certain cases where or
dinary citizens would certainly be run
In. If a member of the house of com
mons commits a crime, be can be ar
rested like any other citizen, but if it la
a case of contempt of court, such as
not paying debts, he can snap his fin
gers at 1 the police during the greater
part of the year— that is to say, he can
not be arrested while parliament Is sit
ting nor for 40 days before and 40 days
after the session. This gives him ex
emption during about nine-tenths of
the year.
Of course a peer enjoys the same
good fortune, and so does a peeress in
her own right But in their case the
privilege Is still greater, for they can
not be arrested on a civil process at
any time, whether parliament Is sit
ting or not In fact. If the heir to a
peerage happens to be in prison for any
offense not criminal, be is liberated the
moment he succeeds to the title.
Foreign . embassadors may commit
any offense, from drunkenness up to
murder, without running the slightest
risk of seeing the Inside of an English
prison. "And not only have the embas
sadors themselves this privilege, but
their - secretaries, coachmen, cooks,
valets, etc., are equally favored indi
viduals, for the theory is that an cm
bossador Is useless without his dinner,
bis drives, his shaves and the like.
When an ambassador commits a
crime, air that can be done Is to ask
his government to recall him. But of
course, If be went about the streets
knocking many people down he would
certainly be arrested and held tempo
rarily. But he could not be tried and
punished. The foreign embassador's
house, family and servants are looked
upon as If they were In their own coun
try. Under no circumstances could a
policeman or bailiff break Into the
house or arrest any of the Inhabitants.
Soldiers, while on service, could run
up debts, refuse to pay, and if a judge,
after ordering them to pay, without re
sult Issued a warrant for their arrest
and committal, no policeman dare exe
cute It unless th« amount were over
$150. Navy men enjoy the same privi
leges, but no doubt they seldom get
the opportunity of exercising them.
The clergy are another class of men
who are sometimes secure against ar
rest A clergyman cannot be arrested
when be Is celebrating divine service
or conducting the celebration of rites
for. the dead; nor can he be touched
when going to or returning from either
of these duties. Any one breaking tho
law In this respect might be punished
with as much as two years' Imprison
ment with hard labor.
On Sundays we are all privileged.
No one can be arrested on Sunday ex
cept for treason, felony or breach of
the peace. If any one tries It on with
you, you can resist up to the point of
killing him.
A carious rule in connection with ar
rest Is not generally known— if a police
man comes along after a fight or an
assault he can make no arrest without
a warrant— London Tit-Bits.

In a recent lecture on Rome Mr.

value of the city of Rome, from the
point of view of general culture and
education, was that It had by far the
longest and most complete history of
any city In the world. It had three
great qualities as the center of human
culture and the development of human
civilization. It was the center of the
ancient world for many centuries, It
became the center of the early Chris
tian world and for 1,000 years It had
been the center of religious pilgrim
ages, while for four or five centuries It
had been the center of poetry and art
of the modern world. These three
great epochs together made up some
thing like 3,000 years, and no city In
the world had had so continuous . a
life. Hardly a century passed without
leaving Its memorial In Rome.— London

MISCELLANEOUS. .
It is just as easy to drift into danger
as to dnve into it. The progress is slower
but the end is equally sure. It is the
gradual progress of drifting which blinds
to the danger. Men and women drift into
ill-health m such a way. There is a
little feeling of oppression after eating.
After a time it passes away. Someday
it returns and brings another symptom
headache, perhaps. Something w done
to relieve the headache, bnt nothing to
.relieve the cause. So one more victim
goes drifting on to the rocks of disease.
Young -women who are teaching or
studying are very apt to become victims
of disease of the stomach. They eat in-
judiciously, in some cases, and in gen-
eral the brain is too occupira to allow
the stomach the blood necessary lo carry
on its functions. Hence in time the
organs of digestion and nutrition are
totally deranged,' and the young gradu-
ate goes home a chronic invaSd.
The timely use of Dr. Pierces Golden
Medical Discovery will avert such a con-
dition ; the faithful use of it in chronic
cases will effect a complete cure.
" I was troubled with very frequent headache*.
often accompanied by severe vomiting." writes
Miss Mary Belle Summerton, of San Diego, Duval
Co., Texas. "Bowels were irregular and my
stomach and liver seemed continually out of
order. Often I could eat almort nothing, and
sometime* absolutely nothing, for twenty-four
hours at  time. I wai entirely unfit for work,
and my whole system seemed so ran down that
I feared a severe side spell and wai very much
discouraged. I was advised to try Dr. Pierce*
Golden Medical Discovery, and Mfore finishing
the third bottle I was able to undertake the da-
ties of public school life, and contracted to do so."

STAND BY YOUR COLORS.
If you want to constantly recruit first-time voters keep
your political party in power. For just as certain as water
will seek its level just so certain will the dominant political
party ot a county, State or Nation secure a majority of the
young men who arrive at their majority. It is natural to -go
with the party in power and young voters, unless influenced
by fathers and elder brothers, and not always then, will grav
itate to the ranks of the party that is distributing the "loaves
and fishes." The lesson to be learned froni this is very plain,
so plain that a person "though a fool need not err therein."
Namely, vote as you talk, for your part}'. Do no scratching
unless for good and sufficient political. reasons, allow no per
sonal spite or spleen to step in audinfluence you to give the
party you desire to see dominant a slap in the face by voting
for a political opponent.. To keep your party in power is the
chief end to be attained, that is if you believe its influence is
the best for your country. If you are a Republican, vote that
ticket from top to bpttoin, unless very grave reasons inter
vene to prevent it. And if a Democrat, Populist or Prohi
bitionist fight it out on the same Hue. These weathercock
voters do more harm than good. The good Lord deliver the
Republican party of Amador from them. If Republicans of
this county had voted iv former years a strkt party ticket as
their wily opponents — the Unterrified — almost always do,
Republicans would be in power to-day and would have been
the most of the time during the past score of 3'ears. Get into
line, fellow Republicans, and stand there like a stone wall,
and the tables will be turned on the Democrats in spite of
r-r— ; and high water. Don't be misled by suave and oily
tongued demagogues who want office year in and year out
for a life time. Use a little common sense in the matter and
stand by your colors. ,
AN OBJECT LESSON.
Woodland DemocratPersonal The manner in which business is
transacted in most flourishing districts in the southern part
of the State ought to be an object lesson of what can be ac
complished by harmony and concerted action among our bus
iness men. A visitor to Los Angeles hears nothing but
good words for that city and surrounding country. If one
dealer has nothing that just suits the home-seeker, he intro
duces him to another dealer, hoping that the customer may
find what he wants without leaving the county. In some
portions of the Sacramento Valley homeseekers are actually
driven away by the pessimistic talk of men who, unless they
can do the business themselves, are not willing that it shall
be done at all. We cannot reasonably expect that there will
be any permanent movement toward the development of the
Valley until our people conclude to be loyal to home inter-
• ests. The first thing to do.is to exterminate the knockers.
The Chinese trouble causes grave apprehensions on -the
part of the whole world, so to speak, and is a basis for wild
and foolish prophesy on the part of many would-be seers.
These irresponsible charlatans predict. all sorts of uncomfort
able things which they seek to stuff into the ears of a too
credulous public. The truth is bad enough and of great mo
ment, and should not be distorted by fanatics with gangrened
imaginations. The latest news from China announces the
departure of foreign diplomats from Pekin, but does not give
their whereabouts. It is believed by our Government officials
that the situation in China is chauging for the better.
Ii ? the Democracy was this year united we should not
have the remarkable. spectacle of Mr. Bryan, the conceded
leader for a nomination, writing magazine articles telling his
people what the Democratic, platform must be. The reason
for this strange procedure is not difficult -to discover— it is
necessary to pre-empt the sentiment of the Kansas City con
vention. If the Democrats were left to themselves to frame
their platform, it is certain that there is an element in the
party strong enough, if not handicapped by prearrangement,
to give conservatism on the expansion question some show to
be heard.-- Record-Union.

GRADUATING EXERCISES.
.- ; -• f - - - -
The Class . of i 1900 . Are Presented With
Diplomas In Webb.HaU. •
VqLast Friday bvening Webb Hall was
the scene of "a most pleasing and in
structive entertainment. The hall was
decorated in the class colors, green and
pink, relieved by, ivy, evergreens and
sweet peas. Just over the stage was
the class mottoPersonal' "Form an Ideal and
Strive to Attain It." On the left of
the stage was a portrait of Washing
ton and on the right ono of Lincoln.
At the appointed hour, or perhaps a
trifle later, Wm. SPersonal Williams, princi
pal of the Jackson school, called the
assembly to order and introduced Rev.
F. A. Morrow, pastor of the M. 13.
church, who feeliugly and eloquently
asked God to bless t,ho proceedings, the
teachers and pupils, the ptoplo of Jack
son and the graduating class." A short
address was then delivered by Princi
pal Williams during which ho touched
upon several ' vital points relative to
educational work, and made excellent
suggestions. His l-cniarks were timely
and exceedingly instructive.
At the conclusion of the address, Miss
Sarah Grimshaw was -introduced, and
with much graco delivered 'the saluta
tory, which was heartily applauded.
This was followed by a banjo duet' by
Mr. and Mrs. D. C. Chambers, which
captivated the house. . an encore being
vociferously demanded, but owing to
the length of tho programme, encores
were declared off and the audience re
luctantly acquiesced.
Mrs. Mac Green Jones, a talented
elocutionist who had kindly volunteered
her nervices for tho occasion, was then
introduced and made a choice, rendition
of "I Had a Message lo Send Hor."
The speaker was in good form, hor
voice sweet and musical and . tone pure
and most pleasing to the ear. The
audience manifested its satisfaction by
hearty applause Miss Ethel Wharff,
of tho graduating class, followed with
"The History of Slavery," a well pre
pared paper, which was listened -to
with marked attention.
A solo by Miss Thirza Faull,. who is a
general favorite among music loving
people, was. received with great pleas
ure, j Miss'Faull is always good, but
on this occasion her performance was
exceptionally pleasing. Mrs. Ed. Kay
presided at the piano in her usual
charming'mannor.
At this juncture Prof. Williams an
nounced that owing to the failure of
her voice, Miss Cassio Lawless would
be unable to present her excellent essay
entitled, "The Class History." This
was unfortunate for Aliss Lawless stood
highest in tho class and had prepared
an able paper. "Good and Bad Books"
was tho thciue of Miss Bulle Dovan, and
she handled tho subject admirably.
Miss Bertha Williams of Vallejo,
daughter of a former pastor hero, and
sister of Prof. Williams, contributed
materially to the evening's pleasure by
rendering a vocal solo. Miss Williams
has a very sweet voice, and sings with
good expression. This number was fol
lowed by "John Loved His Young Wife
as -Flowers Love Dew, "by Mrs. Mac
Green Jones. It was a decided hit, and
the audience said so in au unmistakable
and emphatic manner. "
Miss Elva Kirkwood was introduced,
and iv a clear and distinct tone of voice,
a rare thing among members of grad
uating classes, read "The Class Pro
phesy,'' and if a tenth part of it comes
true tho Jackson class of^l9oo will be in
the swim and among the "Four Hun
dred" for many a year to come.
The paper showed originality \ of
thought and brilliant imagination.' - .
And now came an extremely inter
esting part of the programme, the pre
sentation of diplomas, which whs pre
ceded by an eloquent and appropriate
address by Mr. Wm. Greonhalgh, a for
mer teacher and member of the Board
of Education.
The diplomas, neatly tied .with rib
bons of the class colors, 1 having been
duly presented, Miss Agnus Newman,
valedictorian of the class, speaking so
all could hear, delivered an able and in
terosting and appropriate valedictory.
The audience was just getting ready
to be dismissed when Miss Ethel
Wharff who had been selected 'by her
classmates to perform the pleasant
duty, stepped forward and in a neat
little speech presented Principal Wil
liams with a beautiful pearl handled
sterling silver paper cutter and a hand
some sterling silver match safe, they
being a present from the class in token
of their love and esteom for the teachor
who had successfully guided them so
far along life's educational highway.
This closed the exercises and tho
largo audience departed with only,
words of praise for all who had contrib
uted to please them and with best
wishes to each member of the graduat
ing class of I'JOO.

Death of Charles Andrew Wood.
One of the most promising and best
thought of young men of Plymouth has
passed into the Great Beyond,,- loved
aud respected by all of the people with
in the circle of acquaintances. Refer
ence is made to the late Charles An
drew Wood who succumbed to the rav
ages .of typhoid-pneumonia' on last
Wednesday at tho home of his father,
Andrew P. Wood, at. Plymouth. The
deceased, who was 32 years of age, had
spent his entire life, excepting a month
or two at a time, Personal under the paternal
roof and was the constant companion
and chief support of his aged father.
He had been working in  the mines
and his last and fatal siekos3 was in
duced by powder smoke. He-was sick
and confined to his bed one week and
from the first insisted that death alone
would give relief from his physical suf
fering.
Women, of the neighborhood min
istered to his wants, and made his bed
of Hicknoss as comfortable as it was pos
sible to do, and with that Christian
spirit which tilled them pointed out to
the sufferer the beauties of the Great
Beyond.
His very serious condition was not
realized until it was too late to summon
to his bedside his only near relatives,
Mrs. Callie Bacon of San Dle"o, his
only sister, and John Wood of Sacra
mento, his only brother. The latter,
however, arrived shortly after hie
death. Personal - ;. 
-The funeral took place from the
Methodist Episcopal church at Ply
mouth on Saturday the 22d instant aud
was very largely attended, j Almost the
entire population testified its love and
respect for the deceased by floral offer
ings, and its regret of his early demise
by tears. His body was given its last
resting place in tho little cemetery of
Plymouth whore his grave will be kept
green by those who loved him and by
those whom he loved.' • . * '

Centennial— Drytown.
Superintendent L. A.' Gross of the
Centennial mine was in ' Jackson ; last
Saturday and exhibited samples of ore
from the 630 level that he says will aa
say $107 a ton and other levels that will
go $60. This is very encouraging.
Butte Basin Gravel ' Mine.
Superintendent Stewart of the Butte
-Basin Gravel Co., .has put up 'a* two
- horse power whim recently. Gravel in
the long tunnel has been encountered
that will yield $16 per ton in places, tha
average being about $4 a ton. Mr.
Stewart expects to go to San Francisco
today to confer with the officers of the
company relative to other necessary
improvements.
Fremont— Amador.
Among the. mining operations on a
large scale, now under way ' in this
county, the work under contemplation
at the Fremont and Gover mines ranks
second to none. At least $200,000 is to
be expended on this property just as
rapidly as the work can be judiciously
done. At present the new shaft at the
Fremont is down a little over 300 feet.
'At a certain depth not yet determined,
crosscutting from thir shaft to the vein
; will be done. The old- Gover shaft will
be unwatered and retimbered, and eqiii
distant from the two shafts which are
1200 feet apart, a6O-stamp mill will be
built. A gallows frame is now in pro-
V* cess of "erection, "tho -main' timbers of
which are. Bo feet in length and four
feet square at thfe butt, gradually taper
ing to two feet sqnareat the top. These
timbers will be placed on solid concrete
- - foundations. When completed the
hoist will be a model of its kind; ' In the
- hoist there are to be placed two rock
I breakers, one above the other; the up
per one breaking the rock to a certain
size and the lower one reducing to
 about the size of a walnut.

For some time rumors have been
floating about that this mine was open
ing up with excellent prospects. ;.f"A
visit of inspection had been contemplat
ed for some time, and Saturday, June
23d, two friends dropped in on the
genial superintendent, James E. Dye,
and found him busy in the mill, super
vising the fitting up of additional
stamps and concentrators, preparatory
to handling the immense quantity of ore
that is being blpcked out. After show
ing us about the mill, where 20 stamps
were pounding away on ore that was
yielding enough to make the superin
tendent wear a satisfied smile, he kind
ly invited us to inspect the workings at
the 500 level where the force is at pres
ent making extensive preparations for
stoping. This work is being done on
the hanging wall ledge, where an ap
parently inexhaustable jj quantity of
most excellent looking ore is in sight.
This ledge is .many feet in width and is
as highly mineralized as any ore that
we ever examined. The whole exposed
mass of ore fairly scintillating with sul
phurets. This ore yields 6% in sulphur
ets, that assays $60 per ton, to say
nothing of the free gold, which, at the
time of our examination, made the
plates look well enough to satisfy any
one, unless he "wanted the earth."
In our humble judgment the Old Ama
dor Queen, is on the eve of an awaken
ing that. will astonish some of tho wise
ones who think that there is nothing in
this great ledge extending from the
Zeile to the river and beyond.
We congratulate Superintendent
Dye •on the probable successful out
come qf his struggle to make a mine of
this property. '
CALAVERAS COUNTY.
ProspectPersonal The Golden Eagle mine
of Eproson & Brown at Jenny Lind, of
which I have heretofore written, . has
struck it and struck it rich, i Some
time ago expert Jennings made a sur
rey and made his calculations that the
high grade ore lay at a depth of 100
feet or co. He started ; his tunnel and
after passing through about 30 feet  of
low grade ore, at the end of the 100
feet tie set off a blast that uncovered
the vein. The rock is rich in gold and
silver and goes from two to three hun
dred dollars a .ton. It is a fine green
ore, but at the present writing no true
knowledge of its extent can be known.
It has the appearance of a. big proposi
tion, and from the geological formation
in which it is located should be a per
manent proposition. ••'. • .-; .
The Ozark mine has been incorpor
ated and will soon place stock upon
the market for working ' purposes.
This mine, which is situated between
Murphys and Angels, is only partially
developed. It's showing is excellent.
It has been recently prospected in a
thorough manner and the company has
expended quite a liberal sum in sinking
shafts and running drifts. They have
at last ascertained the true "lay", of
the deposits. It waa thought, how
ever, by Mr. Mitchler, the owner, that
it would be better to organize for the
purpose of development work, he alone
being unable to continue mining for
financial reasons. Some good pros
pects have been found, and tho entire
ground crossed by the tunnel prospects
well.
Last Saturday night G. L. Jaeger,
W. W. Adams and E. Bilhuler of New
York,, stockholders in the Ford Mining
Company, arrived in San Andreas.
They spent a portion of the night in
inspecting the Ford mine and mill and
Sunday morning went to the Sheep
Ranch to visit that property, in which
they are also interested.
Operations at the May Day mine
down the grade are going on smoothly.
It is thought that the lode will be
reached and the contract completed
within the next week. This fact will
determine very much for the future of
mining down the grade. The result of
this tunnel is awaited with a great deal
of interest.
CitizenPersonal Some 16,000 feet of timbers,
a portion of the 50,000 feet ordered,'
have arrived at the Commodore mine
ty) b* us«<l fgr th<j shaft as siokiog pro
grasses. • - • , • »
W. C. Ralston, general manager of
Melones Company at Robinson's Ferry
is now at the mines of the Company.
It is said that he will spend most of his
time at the mine and take - personal
charge of affairs. Work will be re
sumed on the dam in about two weeks.
ChroniclePersonal* At j the I Berdina I mine
near this place, owned by a New York
company and managed by J. K. Car
penter, everything is progressing nice
ly and the ore 1b improving in value
daily as the work in the tunnel pro
gresses. Some, very good rock was
struck last' week,' which assays very
high in both sulphurets and free gold.
The mill is running day and night and
is crushing four tons of ore to the
stamp .The new six-foot concentrators
of 'the Hendy -Norton patent, have
been added to the equipment, making
the plant first-class in every respect.
A'forty sixteenPersonal candle-power dynamo
supplies light for all the buildings and
mill." The grounds around the office
and mill have been leveled off, present
ing a much neater appearance. The
boarding house has been enlarged to a
six room building. v A.new assay office
has been erected to meet . the require
ments of the mine. New chairs and a
beautiful writing desk came up this
week fpr the use pf the business man
ager, Mr. Carpenter.
- "Jnst at present there seems to be a
lull in mining activity in the vicinity of
Jesus Maria, but it is to be hoped , that
this will bo of short duration as tho
mines are there and only awaiting the
hand of development. On the Mauna
Bros, mine, nix miles from this place
and about a mile and a half from Jesus
Maria,' operations are expected to begin
soon. This property has been worked
off and on by the owners for. some
years and as far es work has progressed
the result, is very satisfactory. One
shaft was sunk to a depth of fifty feet
on the ledge, revealing a 3-foot vein.
Nineteen tons of ore from this shaft
were milled in the Whiskey Slide mill
and the yield was $15^ to the ;ton,^ex
clusive of the 1 * sulphurets. A crosscut
tunnel- from Wet Gulch was - next run,
cutting the vein at a depth* of 60 feet;
thence, the vein .was followed on its
course for a distance of 60 feet. At the
intersection " of ' the crosscut the vein
was three feet wide, but its average
width, taking, the length, of the drift,
is about two feet. | Near the end of the
drift the vein divides, one portion fol
lowing the foot wall and the other the
hanging wall, with yellow porphyry
between,' about a foot in width. ; This
•horse' or porphyry formation grad
ually pinches out and v the two veins
come together, again in -the shaft,
where the ledge is three feet in width,
as above stated. The chute of ore
pitches north, as far as explorations
nave gone, and the ore is good milling
all the way. The trend of the vein is
north and south, and the dip is slightly
to the west. The formation is contact
between slate and granite. Three
assays were made through W. B. Mur
dock of San Francisco, the highest be
ing $27 and the lowest $7 to the ton, ex
clusive of sulphurets. This property
is the nOrth extension of the Caldwell
mine. It is so situated that water for
power could easily be had from Jesus
Maria creek, but for the present steam
is deemed the most convenient and ex
peditious. . 'When i thoroughly opened
up there is no doubt that this will prove
a valuable mine.' Some mining experts
who came up a short time ago to in
sj>ect the property were - well pleased
with its appearance.  .S^

only pne twenty could be found, and
suspicion fastened upon pne of the com

story goes, he was hustlod into a back
room of the saloon and searched, every

money not being found, his accusers
allowed him to go, and soon after his
departure another by-stander found
the money in the road where the owner
had lost it.

MOST HORRIBLE ACCIDENT
Almost Fatal Ending of a
A COUPLE OF MINERS COMBAT AT THE GWIN
An Old Kubber Coat Is the Cause of
the Fight-One Stabbed With
a Candlestick. ? ~
Late yesterday morning there oc
curred just out of Amador City an acci
dent that might have caused an ir
reparable loss, the loss of life. V.7V
Harry B. Hinkson, accompanied by
his wife and a driver, William Ardltto,
left Amador City with a load of house
hold goods for Placerville where he had
Intended to take up his residence, he
having recently severed his connection
with the Keystone mine, in which he
bad lately been injured. As they neared
the saloon on the hill on the Dry to wn
road, William Batton, the proprietor,
jumped into the road and endeavored
to stop the team, Batton, in the mean
time, using the most vulgar of language.
In the presence of a lady this was un
bearable and they tried to drive on,
but the infuriated man still followed.
The horses became flighty at the un
usual commotion. Arditto got out to
attend to Batton, leaving the lines in
Mr. Hinkson 's hand, Mrs. Hinkson
having her foot on the brake. Down
the hill rushed the frightened' team.
Mrs. Hlnkson's foot slipped from the
brake, and she was about to fall over
the dashboard between the horses,
when her husband grabbed her. This
loosened the lines. The horses jumped
upon a bank and the rig was over
turned.
Some one going out behind them,
saw the accident, and getting out of his
cart to help the unfortunates, his horse
turned around and ran into town. He
rode back on horse back, bringing
news of the accident to relatives.
About noon the injured persons were
brought home, she on a stretcher with
a white sheet thrown over the ' body
followed by a mournful procession, he
in the Keystone Supply Company's
delivery wagon.
Drs. Freshman and Crowder were
summoned. Mr. Hinkson is seriously
lacerated about the face and body,
while his wife is also seriously cut about
the face and head. Up to a late hour
last night she was still unconscious.
Both are seriously injured.
Batton was arrested by Constable
Gray and taken to Sutter Creek, being
released on $200,. which he got in Sut
ter Creek, not being|able to get it in
Amador City.
STABBED ELEVEN TIMES.
A Fierce Fight Between Two Miners
at the Gwin Mine.
An exciting affray took place at the
Gwin mine last Sunday afternoon about
5Personal30, which resulted in the infliction of
eleven punctures In the body and arms
of Fred Botcher by Joseph Hamby of
Mok. Hill, who used his stiletto-shaped
miner's candlestick with insane fury,
plunging it into his victims shoulders
three times, into his left side and lung,
barely grazing the heart, three times,
into his left arm and shoulder four
times and through one of his thumbs.
The altercation occurred near the
mouth of the shaft, both men having
just come off shift, and was over an old
gum coat which Botcher was wearing
and which; Hamby claimed belonged to
him, When he taxed Botcher with
having his coat, he was told that If it
belonged to him to take it, but he in
sisted that It be replaced by a new one
or that the price of a new one be hand
ed over by Botcher, This Botcher re
fused to do, and Hamby, a man long
noted for a violent temper, flew Into a
dreadful rage and began beating
Botcher over the head with his dinner
bucket, but this did not satisfy his
thirst for vengeance and ho dropped
the milder form of weapon and grasped
his poniard-pointed candlestick using
it as above stated,
Dr. E. E. Endicott of Jackson was
telephoned for and .hastened to the
supposed dying man with all speed, but
on examinaiion found that his injury
was not necessarily fatal, and as we go
to press the chances are said to be fav
orable for recovery,
Hamby is an old resident of Mokel
umne Hill, where he has a family. He
Is now in jail in San Andreas awaiting
trial. ; •
The affair created great excitement
among the miners of the Gwin, which
for a time ran almost dangerously high
but the cool headed officials of the com
pany soon had the matter under full
control.
Lawn Party.
One of the must enjoyable lawn
parties ever given in Jackson was held
at the home of James L. Fontenrose,
last Saturday evening, by the graduat
ing class of 1899 in honor of the mem
bers of the class of 1900. The beautiful
lawn was decorated with Japanese lan
terns and a merrier gathering of young
folks it would be difficult to find. The
programme consisted of an address by
Miss Annie Baker; reading by Miss
Mabel Northey; solo, Miss Nita Little
field ; piano solo, Miss Bertie Kay. In
addition to the program, many inter
esting games were enjoyed. Light re
freshments were served during the
evening. Among the happy partici
pants were the members of the gradu
ating classes and teachers of the Jack
son school. Father Time was on the
point of ringing out the twelve strokes
of midnight when the happy affair ter
minated.
Won Scholarships.
Last week sixty -one pupils of the
schools of this county were examined
for grammar grade diplomas, a large
per cent, of the number securing the
same. Two scholarships were offered by
the Chesnutwood College, which were
to be awarded to the two pupils making
the highest average. The scholarships
were awarded to Miss Anna A. Little of
Plymouth, and Master Joseph Gara
baldl of Volcano. This is a great honor,
and Miss Little and Master Garabaldi
are to be heartily congratulated by all
who appreciate thoroughness in educa
tional work.
The Ledger presents its compli
ments to these young students, and
takes pleasure in placing their names
on the complimentary list for one year.
Correction.

A Native Daughter's Visit to Jsokson.
|
In view of the many kind things said
about the Native Daughters by the
representatives of the press, on the oc
casion of our recent visit to Jackson,
and of the many kind things done for
us by the good people of the town, It
seems to me but courteous to express
our appreciation of these kindnesses,
and to discribe briefly the busy and
bustling little town, where the order of
the N. D. G. W. originated.
The first impression made after leaving
lone, the terminus of the railroad, was
one long to be remembered. We could
all sympathize with the people of ancient
Pompei when they were being buried
alive with the dust, ashes and fire of
the treacherous Vesuvius, except that
In our case we were spared the ashes
and fire. Notwithstanding the infelici
ties of tho trip, there were many things
of Interest as we were hurried up and
down the grades, and over a somewhat
rough and broken country.
. But when we swung around the
curve of the famous Kennedy and Arg
onaut mines, with their everlasting
clatter of stamps, and other evidences
of activity, and caught our first glimpse
of the pretty little mountain town
nestling along the banks of Jackson
creek, we felt, at least, partly repaid.
As we drove into the town, all deck
ed out in red and gold in honor of our
coming, we began to smile through the
layers of accumulated dust, and while
we realized that "all is not gold that
glitters," there Is much that is golden
in the kindness of heart that prompted
such a royal reception. The little city
was decorated from end to end, and
each vied with the other to make our
visit one to be remembered always.
Jackson Is a busy mining town, with
its stamp mills pounding out the golden
treasures that Mother Nature had hid
den away, deep down in her rook
vaults, pounding it out not only to en
rich the enterprising owners, but all
the inhabitants thereof. In the center
overlooking the surrounding town and
country, stands the Court House, where
the Blind Goddess holds the scales that
are supposed to deal out even justice to
all peojile. Near by stands the school
house and churches, the unfailing sign
of American progress and enlighten
ment. It is a beautiful place and is in
habited by a generous hearted com
munity. • .
The Native Daughters will ever re
member Jackson and her people kindly
and even go to the length of praying
that in the near future she may be
blessed with a railroad among other
manifold blessings. With Rifi Van
Winkle, we will say, "Here's to Jack
son, may she live long and prosper."

Bichtmyer Estate.
The estate of the late B. F. Richt
myer was settled and closed up in the
Superior Court at the session on Wed
nesday last. The hearing came up on
the question of confirming the report
of the Commissioners in Partition,
Messrs. C R. Downs, manager of the
Sutter Creek and lone Water Works.
Geo, A. Gordon, Superintendent of
Schools and B. F. Taylor of the Zeile
and Argonaut mines. The report
ascertained the true value of the Water
Works and assigned them to Mrs.
Richtmyer upon her paying over the
pro rato of value for the other" heirs,
in accordance with sectloo-1680 of the
Code of Civil Procedure. The attor
neys for the other heirs put up a spirit
ed fight against the confirmation of the
report, but after hearing all the evi
dence the Court confirmed the report
of the Commissioners, the money was
paid over in open Court, and the mat
ter closed. Judge Davis represented
Mrs. Richtmyer and J. L. Sargent and
Freeman & Willis, the absent heira.
Speer Estate Contest.
The contest over the final account of
Mrs. Speer, administratrix of the estate
of James Speer, who died August 29,
1882, occupied the time of the Superior
Court last Friday and the first two
days of this week. The contest against
her mother is being made by Mrs.
Mary E. Harmon of New York Ranch.
The account covers a period of ten
years, from August 29, 1882, to Jan
uary 28, 1893. A mass of evidence and
vouchers were introduced and the case
argued and submitted to the Court
Tuesday afternoon. Hon. John F.
Davis represents the administratrix and
F. L. Stewart the daughter. The con
test^involves the question of income
from the homestead ranch during tha
years above mentioned.
Big Time at Biggs.
Hon. John F. Davis made a rushing
trip to Biggs and ; back last Saturday
and Sunday. The occasion was ar ousi
ng ratification meeting, the Biggsites
lairly outdoing themselves. Two
bands, torchlight procession and an
immense crowd. The speakers were
Hon. Fred H. Greeley, ex-Senator of
Yuba county, and Hon. John F. Davis,
Senator of this district. The meeting,
which was enthusiastic from start to
finish, lasted until after midnight.
The valley and the mountain districts
were represented in the speakers.
Good idea.
Saw The Derby Won.
Attorney Fred L. Stewart received a
letter from his associate in business,
Wm. J. McGee, one day last week in
which Mr. McGee gives some interest

journey. Among other things of in
terest, he mentions that he witnessed
the Prince of Wales win the Derby.
Mr. McGee has visited England, Ire
land, Scotland and Wales and is now in
Paris "rubbernecking" about the Ex

His Views on the Precaution* Taken
to Prevent His Escape.
One of the extracts from Dr. O'Mea
ra's St Helena diavy. In The Century
records Napoleon's views on the pre
cautions taken to prevent his escape.
He spoke anew about escaping and
said .that if he was inclined to try It,
which he was not, there were 95
chances in 100 against his effecting it.
"But," said he, "this Jailer every week
Imposes new and vexatious restrictions
upou me, Just as if I was In a place
where I had nothing to do but to step
into a boat and be away. When I was
at Elba, it was different It Is true
that while one lives there is a chance
of escape. Although ironed and chain
ed down, inclosed in a cell of stone and
every human precaution taken against
a possibility of it, still there is a chance
of escape, and the only way to prevent
it is to put me to death.
"This is the only sure way. Let him
put me to death, and all uneasiness on
the part of the European powers, Lord
Castlereagh himself and his govern
ment will cease. No more expense
then; no more squadrons to watch me
or poor soldiers, fatigued to death with
pickets and guards or harassed with
carrying burdens up those precipices.
I am sure those poor devils have rea
son to hate me and wish my death.
They must, however, be conscious that
the fatiguing duties imposed upon
them are unnecessary and vexatious,
as the sight of the Island must con
vince every one but a suspicious cog-
Hone that escape from It was nearly
impossible unless, as I have said be
fore, that while there is life there is a
chance, if attempted.
"Where could I go to, allowing that 1

could arrive at I would find enemies to
seize me. This governor's conduct will
soon be known in England and will not
procure him any credit, there. Those

treated and their opinion of It The

A FEMININE FAILING.
Difficulty Haxiy of the Sex Hare In
Telllnsr Right From Left.
'1 saw by a paper last week that a
colored woman was excluded from tes
tifying in court because she didn't
know her right hand from her left and
was therefore esteemed too ignorant
for her evidence to be of any value,"
said an observant man yesterday.
"Now, do you know I don't believe one
woman out of six knows her right
hand from- her left without stopping
to consider the matter.
"I was standing In the foyer of a
theater the other day at a matinee
watching the audience, mostly femi
nine, as It passed in." Well, each maid
handed her check to the usher, and he
called out 'First door to the right' or
'Second door to the left,' as the case
might be. With hardly an exception
those girls turned in the wrong direc
tion; then they'd pause to consider, ex
claim, .'We're going the wrong way!'
and skurry back again.
"This happened so often that I spoke
to the usher about it 
"They always do it,' he replied la
conically • 'I usually point so they'll
know the way, but I've neglected to do
that today. They're all right if they
6top to think, but they never do think.'
. "I myself know an intelligent young
woman who has to make a little mo
tion as If she were writing with both
hands before she can determine the
right one, and she declares that all her
acquaintances are affected in like man
ner, so perhaps this is a general femi
nine failing, and the colored witness
was unjustly excluded." — Baltimore

find this information of great service.
Some time ago I went into a large

think, and in talking with the clerk I
found the lot bad been sent to his store
from a big manufacturing concern to

general store and understand that busi

sort of thing.
"A few weeks afterward this manu

Montana Sapphires.

been as systematically worked as have
been the sapphires of the orient True,
they are light in color, but they have
more brilliancy than the Asian sap
phires and often exhibit dichorism, or
double color, under different lights.
PersonalThe supposition that a sapphire should
be dark blue Is possibly responsible for
the slowness of their acceptance in the

HOW A CLAIM PAID.
One Way of Getting Money Without
Panning It Oat.
"There are more ways of making
money off a claim than panning it
out," sr ,i an Alaska miner who had
some luck with his pick and shovel.
"For instance, I knew a man of means
in the Dawson district who had a
claim which had failed to be as profit
able as expected, and he didn't know
Just what to do with It to get his
money back until he had devoted con
siderable thought to it And it was sim
ple enough when he knew how.
"He quietly went to the gold com
missioner and announced that he wish
ed to pay his 10 per cent royalty on the
product of his claim for a year, which
was $6,000. The commissioner ac
cepted the $6,000 royalty and gave him
the usual receipt, stating on its face
what it was for, with the number of
the claim, location, etc.
• "Then he 'waited patiently about,'
like Mary's little lamb, and one day, in
the course of human events, an Eng
lishman came along looking for a good
thing for some people who had money
to spend. He asked Mr. Blank, among
others, what he had to sell, and the
smooth gent told him he didn't know
exactly, but he would show him bis
goods. They looked over several
claims that were practically unworked,
and then in a casual way Mr. Blank
showed the Englishman bis receipt
for royalty on claim so and so. 'And.
you know,' he said, with a wink, 'that
a man isn't paying royalty on any
more than he can possibly help.'
"The Englishman was right on to
that little game, of course, and he
sized up the $6,000 receipt looked over
the claim In a general way and ended
by buying It for $150,000."—Washing

I am told at the treasury department
that It is not possible for a person to
defraud the government by what they
call "piecing"— that is, by clipping off
small slices of several bank notes and
fitting them together to resemble a
complete note. Such offenses have
been committed, and the guilty persons
have been sent to the penitentiary, but
the treasury never redeems the bills,
and the loss falls upon the persons who
send them In for redemption. There
are several ways of committing frauds
of this nature, and they are done so
skillfully as to escape detection except
by experts. There is now a $500 note
on exhibition at the treasury which
is made up of 16 slices of other notes
so skillfully fitted together as to es
cape the notice of a number of banks
and many people who handled it—Chi

A Fire and Water Trick That Is
Pretty Hard to Explain and an Ap-

Passes ITnderstandlnc
The question of how the fakirs of
India perform their wonderful tricks Is
t matter that has for centuries interest
ed scientists, and the best explanation
that chas yet been offered of the matter
Is that it is done by hypnotic poweir —
that is, that the fakirs simply hypno
tize the entire audience and make them
think that they saw trees grow out of
the ground in a second. Libraries have
been written on the subject In his
book entitled "Quaint Corners of An
cient Empires" Mr. Michael Meyers
Shoemaker deals in an interesting
manner with the Indian fakirs.
In writing about the fakirs he saysPersonal
"The statement has been made by such
prestidigitators as Herrmann and Kel
lar that they had never seen any tricks
by these men of India' which they
could not explain. Be that as It may,
these common street magicians of In
dia do some very clever things.

three feet from the looker on was re
markable. .As to the mango tree trick,
there appeared a strong resemblance
between a tree grown yesterday and
the one produced this morning. But it
was In the other performances that the
observers were most interested.
"In one instance the fakir took a
small jar of metal and handed.it
around to show that it was empty.
Then, placing a copper coin between
his teeth, he began to blow, and smoke
soon issued from his mouth and nos
trils. The Jar, which was held aloft
all the time, was found filled with wa
ter, which commenced to boil furiously.
"Passing it aside, he opened -his
mouth and ejected jets of living flame.
Indeed the whole cavity of the throat
appeared to be filled with fire, which
ignited anything with which It camo
in contact. We all saw the empty Jar,
the filled jar, the boiling water and the
flre, but the fire never approached the
jar. >
"Another trick consisted In causing
a dead and dried up cobra to come to
life, .or so It appeared. The snake is
usually kept in a small, round, flat
basket with a closely fitting cover.
This we saw was empty, and Into it
the fakir laid the flat dried skin of a
dead serpent
"Placing it not three feet from our
circle and in the brilliant light of the
southern sun, he covered the basket
with its lid and then made the usual
passes with the Inevitable cloth, about
a yard square, which he held by two
corners to show that It contained noth
ing.
"His costume consisted of one gar
ment of the shirt order, the sleeves of
which were tucked up at the shoulders,
affording, it would seem, scant oppor
tunity to hide anything, yet when, after
a few waves of the cloth, he removed
the lid of the basket the dead snake
was gone and In its place rose the ma
jestic head and neck of one of the lar
gest of cobras.
"It must be remembered that when
we see such work in England or Amer
ica it is done at a distance and on the
stage, with all the assistance of stage
lights and shadows, but in this case we
were out in the plain air and near
enough for the serpent to have stung
us.
"The last trick consisted of a display
of apparently wonderful strength. A
boy of 10 years of age was tied up in a
large scarf, with Its ends attached to
two strong cords. At the ends of these
cords were hollow brass cups about
the size of an acorn. The fakir, raising
the upper lid of each of his. eyes, In
serted these cups thereunder, with the
hollow side next to the eyeball, after
which he pulled the eyelids well down.
"Then, with hands on hips and head
well back, he arose to his full height,
lifting the boy a foot or more off the
ground and swinging him from side to
side, the entire weight of course failing
upon the brass cups. It seemed a mar
vel that the eyeballs were not destroy
ed.
"Perhaps those who understand these
matters can explain all that was done,
but certainly no magicians on our stage
have accomplished similar feats, and
yet these men are but common street
performers."
Tbe Rooster Was Game.
A Bockland young man is the owner
of a smart rooster and has long enter
tained suspicion that- the bird might
have inherited gamy characteristics
from some long forgotten ancestor. To
apply this theory in an actual test he
went home the other night, surrepti
tiously conveyed the parlor mirror into
the hen pen and held it before the gaze
of the wondering rooster.  .
The young man was not kept long in
suspense as to the bird's fighting qual
ities. After a brief, incredulous glance
at the proud reflection in the glass the
rooster descended upon the object with
spurs set and wrath gleaming from
each beadllke eye. There were a crash,
a smash and a clatter,' and when the
dust and feathers cleared away the
young sportsman stood, a dismayed
spectator, In the center of a pile of
rums formed of broken mirror, slats
and "pulverized plate glass.
He is now satisfied with the rooster,
but how he squared himself about the
broken mirror is not known.— Bangor
Whiz and Courier.
Fairly Good Time.
Seated around a Topeka railroad
lunch counter the other day were four
old Santa Fe engineers. They were
telling of fast runs. Three of them had
told their stories. "The fastest run I
ever made," said the fourth, after lis
tening to the lies of the others, "was
between Topeka and Emporla not long
ago. It was a bright moonlight night.
We were behind when we pulled out of
Topeka and had orders to make up all
lost time between here and Emporla.
After reaching the top of the Pauline
hill I pulled the throttle wide open and
let her go. The old engine fairly ate
up the track. When we stopped at
Emporla, I looked back a mile or so
and saw something black approach
ing us. I could not think what it was.
I watched it closely. Finally It came
up opposite the engine and stopped. It
was the shadow of the train."— Kansas

Ant Engineers.
Something new and interesting about
ants was learned by a Mount Airy
florist recently. For a week or so he
had been bothered by ants that got Into
boxes of seeds which rested on a shelf.
To get rid of the ants he put Into exe
cution an old plan, which was to place
a meaty bone close by, which the ants
soon covered, every one deserting the
boxes of seeds. As soon as the bone
would become thickly inhabited by the
little creepers the florist tossed it Into
a tub of water. The ants having been
washed off, the bone was put In use as
a trap again.
Then the florist bethought himself
that he would save trouble by placing
the bone in the center of a sheet of fly
paper, believing that the ants would
never get to the bone, but would get
caught on the sticky fly paper while
trying" to reach the food. But the
florist was surprised to find that the
ants, upon discovering the nature of
the paper trap, formed a working force
and built a path on the paper clear to
the bone. The material for the walk
was sand secured from a little pile
near by. For hours the ants worked,
and when the path was completed they
made their way over its dry surface in
couples, as in a march, to the bone.—

Humors of Organ Blowers.
An Irishman had been obtained at a
pinch to blow an organ. The player
was ready and the signal was given,
but no wind came. The signal was re
peated a second time, and again a third
time, but still without result The de
lay was becoming awkward, the con
gregation was getting uneasy. What
was to be done? Choristers and organ
ist now united in shouts of "Blowl
blow! blowP' Not the slightest zephyr
stirred within the wind chest • .
At length the organist hastened to
the blower's sanctum. • And what a
sight it was that met his eyes! Cling
ing with heels and hands to the long
wooden handle of the bellows, there
hung the son of Erin, his eyes starting
from their sockets and his cheeks dis
tended and crimson, blowing as If for
dear life into the end of that long
wooden handle!
The anecdote of the ex-sailor blower
Is not so funny, but it is in keeping.
The old tar when he went to blow took
off his boots and his coat and, if It
were warm, nearly everything else,
"for." said he in explanation. "I can
'old on better."— Longman's.

The Ladr and tit* Teeth.
"I was called one day to a certain
hotel to give chloroform to a young
woman who wai about to undergo a
slight surgical operation to remove a
morbid growth In th» ear," said a phy
sician. J'The' patient, as It devOoped
on my arrival, bad been married only a
few days before and was in the city
with her husband on their bridal tour.
Although quite handsome, the was no
longer exactly, in. her first youth, and
•he was very much «▼•«> to ! having
her husband present at the operation.
However, he insisted, and she; finally
agreed that he should. stay, but I no
ticed that she seemed very nervous and
preoccupied.  -' _--,
"The operation, as I said before, was
trifling. She took the chloroform easily
and all went well until she was Just
regaining consciousness,  when she
opened her mouth, and out fell a set of
false teeth. She had said nothing about
that detail, and the truth was that sffe
had hoped, poor. woman, to pass
through the ordeal without the fact of
her wearing such things being known
to her husband. . ..
"But the effect on. that individual
was entirely unexpected. He gave one
horrified glance and then rushed at the
old surgeon and seised him by the
throat 'You infamous scoundrel!*, he
yelled. .Tou have broken my poor dar
ling's jaw!' ;,;Personal•.,Personal.
"At that stage of affairs I beat a re
treat, f never did learn exactly, what
the husband thought bad happened or
what sort of explanation was offered."

Ht Drank Alone.
In the early days of Ventura,. 6aL;
Dr. Bard established «uch a reputation
for willingness to fight that few pre
sumed to provoke his anger. He was
once Informed that the lawyer he had
engaged to represent him In a certain
case had sold out to the opposing side.
"I'll cut his heart out," said Bard when
the news came to him.  . •
Shortly after that, walking with one
of his friends. Dr. Bard met the law
yer on the street. "Come In and have
a drink," said that worthy, and the
three* men, entering the barroom, or
dered three glasses of whisky, which
were put before them. • ' 
"Drink," said Dr. Bard to the law
yer. . Personal." .
"Not until you ar» ready," the law
yer politely replied. •_ .
"No, not with me," said Bard; "you
drink now." .', ';; ' . .
"Not until you drink," Insisted the
legal light. ... ,
Dr.' Bard's ' pistol was out In a mo
ment and pointed between the eyes of
the man who had betrayed j him.
"DrinkP' said he In a voice of thun
der; "drink, I tell you!" The lawyer
drank with avidity, and when he was
through Bard and his friend .threw
their full glasses on the floor. | "We
don't drink with curs," said they and,
turning their backs, walked out of the
