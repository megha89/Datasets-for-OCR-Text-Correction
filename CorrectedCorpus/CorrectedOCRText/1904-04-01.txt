MARTHA
M'CULLOCHWILLIAMS
Copyright 1903, by T C McClure
Cause and effect are your true endless
chain Thus because young Alanson
brought good letters, the ery best, to
the rector and Squire Clark Mrs Brown
gae the garden party where so much
else happened Mrs Brown had three
girls to establish, and, as bcaus were
none too plenty, naturally It was a rul
ing principle with her to let no eligible
young nian get away from Eastbrldge
without a proper experience of their
fascinations
The fascinations were all ery well
until Amy Peters jcania ^Anijr was e*
er' "accounted a beauty, but somehow
she put all the set beauties out of court
and countenance Behold her at the
party tripping airily about the lawn,
with young Alanson at one side, Jock
Hllman at the other and Billy Corliss
tagging after like the faithful watch
dog he was This while the other
young women had less than a beau
apiece You will admit it was aggra
ating Kate Martin, Amy's best
friend, spelled upon her fingers "PIG"
as the train went past her But Kate
was not in the least angry or jealous
She had Bobby Shepherd all to her
self, although Essie Brown had done
her best to lure the gentleman away
"Let me tell you about Miss Amy,"
Jock said to the stranger when pres
ently Amy wns safely enthroned in a
garden chair, with her court still about
her "She's nearly the only, girl in
Eastbridge you don't hae to court,
whether or no you want to"—
"But you know "you always want to,
Jocky, dear," Amy said saucily Billy
Corliss laughed with the rest, but
somehow the laugh did not get into his
eyes Young Alanson kept up the
game braely "Can you Imagine a
lie man not wanting to?" he asked of
the world in general and Billy in par
ticular Billy put on his most reflec
tie look "There might be extenuat
ing circumstances," ho said diplomat
ically Amy gae him a reproachful
glance and said loftilyPersonal "I suppose
Billy, your extenuating circumstances
wear frocks Pray, does it happen by
tiny chance that the most extenuating
of them is named Clarissa Brown?"
"No," Billy said sturdily, shaking his
head "But that reminds me that neither
Mr Alanson nor I hae more than said
'howdy' to Miss Clarissa Jock, you
stay here and keep this quicksiler
young person out of mischief while we
scramble through the decent tiling"
"You may liud us engaged unless you
hurry back," Amy llung after them
Jock laughed aloud "Let's hide," he
said "I know the ery place Won't
It gie Billy a Jolt to come back and
find us missing?"
"He needs one, good and hard," Amy
said, tossing her head the least bit "I
hae not told anybody else, Jock, but
I'm going to marry Billy if I can eer
make him show himself properly and
humanly foolish He's so abnormally
steady going and sensible and settled I
should not dare try to lie up to him—
Unless I knew he had a nice silly streak
somewhere" 
"I suppose you wouldn't any way
consider me I'm pretty near all silly
streaks," Jock said dolefully Amy
laughed and patted his arm, sayingPersonal
"But you hae good sense streaks, too,
Jock, else why should you like me so
well? We'll always lie the best of
friends, I know"
"Bet your bottom dollar on it!" Jock
said, harrying her along lie was mak
ing for a tumbledown summer house,
thickly oergrown with ines, that
nestled In the ery farthest comer of
the lawn It had a plank floor, rotten
and crumbly, and a dilapidated rustic
bench along one side— a cool, deeply
shaded nook, sweet with roses and hon
eysuckle Amy sprang Joyously inside
it, with Jock at her heels As they
made to sit down low, hollow reerbera
tions came up from below their feet
There was a dull crushing, a giing
away, then before they could cry out a
sliding down, down to dark, dank, un
known perilous depths
Fie minutes later Billy was asking
anxiously of those about the garden
chair, "Where is Amy?" Nobody
could tell him Presently he spied far
out In the grass one of her little lace
mitts Running away from it were
faint footmarks on the warm turf
Billy followed the marks, his face
whitening fast "Jock could not be so
cruel as to take her near that old well
house," he said to himself— then
groaned aloud; he had come in sight
of the well house, where the crumbled
floor told him the tale
"Jock! Amy! Answer me! Oh,
God!" he cried aloud, peering oer the
crumbling rim into the blackness No
articulate answer came to him, but
was it fancy that down in the deeps
of earth he heard low, gasping moans?
"He sprang up with a shout that brought
the whole crowd huddling about him
Mrs Brown was at the head, weeping
and wringing her hands "They are
lost, lost!" she moaned "Nobody eer
came out of that well alie It's al
ways half full of choke damp! That
Is why my father had it built oer!
Why didn't I think to tell eerybody?"
Billy seemed not to hear With giant
strength he wrecked the rotten lattice,
clearing the well mouth, then flung off
coat and shoes, and prepared to clam
ber down He had already sent for
ropes "No, I can't wait, with Amy
dying," he said to those who tried to
stop him "I'e got to sae her or
die with her Stand by— listen close—
and let me hae ropes the minute you
can"

well mouth, whence already there
came a faint earthy smell, half sweet
ish, half repulsie Some of the curi
ous were for crowding the edges to
watch him, but wiser ones held them
back "Gie him all the light anil air
possible, poor fellow; he needs both,"
Squire Clark said Young  Alanson,
stripped and barefooted, sprang to the
edge of the curb "Who'll follow me?'^
he asked "I'm going down,' right be^
hind Billy; we may make a lie chain
before it's too late" ;  ' ;
"I'll follow! And I! And I!" came
from all about In a little, the human
line was oer the edge, creeping down,
down to the dangerous deeps, noisome
and cold Billy heard It coming, and
shouted upPersonal  • o 
"In time, thank God! I hear moapsT'
Then he gae a great inarticulate jcry
There, clinging to the rough rock wall,
waS Amy, fie feet aboe the glimmer
ing water, which lapped something
dark and limp • ";' %i S
"Here, you! | Take hef upf!;be critjd,
hoarsely, husbanding 'his breath all he
might He had come to the thick, dead
ly damp Unless he was quick and
bold it would make an end of him, as
It had possibly already made an end
of poor, light hearted Jock Clinging
fast with one hand, his feet well braced
across the well breadth, he swung Amy
up with the other into young Alan
son's hold The others knew enough to
pass her on up and out rawing a
long, long breath, Billy leaped down
beside the insensible figure at the bofr
torn, caught it up and began a desper
ate ascent
"Hold hard, Billy! I'm coming to
help!" young Alansou cried, setting his
feet firmly and bending until bis head
was almost leel with them Thus h\
gripped Jock's collar and somewba*
cased the strain on Billy Both wertf,
howeer, so near to smothering their
tense muscles gae down Lights
swam before their eyes; their heads
were bursting; the subtle heainess in
chest and nostrils niiinbcd them to the
bone Alanson felt himself almost fall
Ing when a rope struck his hand, flung
with such force it almost drew blood
"Send up, Jock! We'll pull you two
out safe!" the men higher up cried <to
them and then, when they saw their
plight, came down like Trojans to help
It was little short of a miracle that any
of the three got out alie But some
how, by the good God's mercy, they
all came into reiing upper air Jock
had the face of a dead man At Bight
of him Amy fell to sobbing "He— he
lifted me up and bade me cling," she
said brokenly, "but stayed on the bot
tom himself because there was not
room for two to hold in the creice of
the wall"
"He won't die for it," r Payne
said, looking up from his patient Billy,
lying spent and white upon the grass,
beckoned Amy imperatiely to him
"You must marry me — right off," he
said, patting her hand "After this I
dare not trust you with yourself"
"Nor I," Amy said, nestling to him
"You were horribly foolish to take sueli
risks for me, Billy It is only by stay
ing with you I can make sure you will
neer do it again"
A Lord Chancellor at Play
It is on record that the great seal of
Britain has twit; been degraded to
kitchen uses In I,sa, when Lord
Brougham, then lord chancellor, was
staying as a guest with the uchess of
Bedford, some ladies of the house party
In a frolic entured to purloin the great
seal from the chancellor's bedroom
Trembling with anxiety, the great
man came downstairs to proclaim his
loss, but to his relief they told him of
their joke and challenged" him to find
his treasure Entering Into the spirit
of their fun, he at last dragged the
emblem of his authority triumphantly
from the coal box
Still in merry mood, ho led the party
to the kitchen, where each lady made
a pancake, with the great seal for a
pan, pouring the batter between its
disks
Tills mad prank created so much
amusement that Lord Brougham re
peated it at Taymouth to gie pleasure
to the Marchioness of Breadalbane —

Young Plants
Eery farmer knows that
some plants grow better than
others Soil may be the same
and seed may seem the same
but some plants are weak and
others strong
And that's the way with
children They are like young
plants Same food, same home,
same care but some grow big
ihd strong while others stay
;mall and weak
Scott's Emulsion offers an
asy way out of the difficulty
Jhild weakness often means
staration, not because of lack
of food, but because the food
loes not feed
Scott's Emulsion really feeds
md gies the child/growing
strength
Whateer the cause of weak
ness and failure to grow —
Scott's Emulsion seems to find
it and set the matter right

The Story of Toledo Cathedral
B The cathedral of Toledo is perhaps
the finest architectural glory that
Spain can boast The site was occupied
by at least three churches before the
erection of the present building, the
first one, according to popular legend,
i haing been erected during the llfe
'tltue of the Virgin Mary and isited
]by her Of this church we know noth
ing The second wns pulled down In
,1032 The third was finished In 1085
and was occupied by the Moors for
many years as a mosque Afterward
•It was the cathedral of Spain, until In
the early part of the thirteenth century
"'Alfonso IX had It pulled down and the
present one erected In its stead It
Is 0 feet long and 20 feet wide, Is
built from material quarried In the
 neighborhood and Is of the purest
Gothic It was designed by Pedro Pe
rez iaz, who superised Its erec
tion for nearly fifty years and conse
crated his life to it uring the fie
, eVrituries after his death more than
'150 architects were employed upon it,
and for 266 years the work was un
interrupted—St James Gazette "
Through Women* Byes
As a finely dressed woman entered
the "L" train eery other woman in
the car eyed her clothes closely
"There," said a man to his wife, who
was making a close Inentory of the
new arrial's dress, "that Is what I
don't like about women They display
such interest In other women's clothes
You see It eerywhere— in parlors, at
receptions and balls and in public con
eyances You neer see men acting
that way lam inclined to beliee this
Is owing to men's finer judgment as to
what Is proper They know that to
take note of another's dress Is the
height of bad manners, and they ab
stain from doing It"
"It is ery nice of you, of course, to
praise your own sex so," said his wife,
"but your explanation is utterly wrong
The reason women notice one another's
clotbjes is that eery woman Is prac
tically a 'dressmaker, and when she
sees a dress she iews It with the in

Confederate Coinage
It Is a matter of history that the
entire coinage of the Confederate
states consisted of four half dollar
pieces The oberse side had a god
dess of liberty (same as United States
coins) In an arc of thirteen stars, hi
her right hand a shield of conentional
design with "Liberty" thereon and be
low the date, 1801 On the reerse
side was an American shield beneath
a Libert} cap, the union containing
seen stars— representing the seen se
ceding states— the whole surrounded by
a wreath; at the left cotton in bloom,
at the right sugar cane The legend
was "Confederate States of America"

ders were milled and the edge was ser
rated—New York Tribune
Old Time Grae Hobbera
Under the laws of raco, the most
seere code eer drawn up, all grae
robbers were put to death without
trial The old Athenian laws put a
slae to death for disturbing a body
after interment, but in the case of a
freeman a "confiscation of a moiety
of his possessions" was the penalty
Constantiue decreed that a woman
might obtain a diorce if she could
proe that her husband had disturbed
the remains of the dead At one time
(In the time of the seenth and eighth
Henrys) the English law held that "it
is deemed unlawful to open a grae
for a second person, except for a hus
band or wife" '; •"Personal;'

A jolly little story Is told by a con

curious faculty the Japanese hae of
Imitating animals "I remember some
years ago," she says, "being at a Christ

the mikado was present The young
prince got himself up by means of a
muff, a sable mantle and a boa for a
tall to look like some extraordinary
feline and then' crawled Into the room

was something so sinuous and lifelike
In his moements that tbe wretched

Why People Stammer
Stammering depends on a want of
harmony between the action ot the
muscles (chiefly abdominal) which ex
pel air through the larynx and that of
tbe muscles which guard the orifice
by which it escapes with that of those
which modulate the sound to the form
of speech Oer either of the groups
of muscles by Itself a stammerer may
hae as much power as other people,
but he cannot harmoniously arrange
their conjoint action Nerousness Ii
a frequent cause of stammering It Is
possible that the defect In strap In
stances may result from malformation
of the parts about the back of the
mouth The fact that stammering
people are able to sing their words
better than to speak them has been
usually explained on the supposition
that In singing the glottis is kept open
so" Jhat there is less liability to spas

ij A COSTLY EXPERIENCE
Personal Colorado presents a striking ex
ample of the disastrous effect of
labor troubles uring the past year
that state has suffered to the extent
of !$50,000,000 This includes the
loss of wages, the decreased produc
tion of the mines, the cost to the
state to maintain order in the dis
turbed districts, the sums paid out
by ,|he labor unions to maintain the
striking miners, and the loss to the
business community generally in
consequence of the decline of pro
duction and the shrinkage of wage
earnings This is at the rate of ten
dollars per capita of the entire pop
ulation of the state The gold pro
duction has fallen off six million dol
lars] owing to this cause Colorado
is far in the lead as the most liberal
producer of the precious metals Her
mineral wealth is inexhaustible, and
there can be no question that her
output of wealth the past year would
hae far exceeded any preious  rec
ordfhad it not been for the unfor
tunate industrial warfare which has
•  •* • ' • 
so cruelly crippled her for the time
being The state is still in the
throes of labor war It is the storm
center of strikes and lockouts Con
sidering the population, probably no
state in the union has eer suffered
so seerely as she has done in so
short a time from the same cause
We»at this distance from the theatre
of sfrifecan form little idea of the
happ and destitution wrought The
contending forces seem to hae set
tled  upon Colorado as the battle
ground where the issues inoled
are io be fought to a finish When
state troops are reinforced by
United States soldiers, and martial
law*'is proclaimed, the situation
must be desperate indeed No doubt
things hae been done by the authori
ties which smack of military des
potism, a denial of indiidual liberty
whictfis the proud boast of eery
American citizen The roundup of
laborigitators, and deporting them
to distant points, with a significant
warning not to return, is uuAmeri
can ijris true It cannot be justified,
except on the plea of dire necessity
in extreme circumstances
THE LICENSE QUESTION
The;; saloon men throughout the
county hae taken no steps, so far
as we hae been able to learn, to
comply with the terms of the license
ordinance passed by the superisors
some two months ago After weigh
ing the matter thoroughly, the gen
eral impression preails that the
ordinance is unworkable; its terms
are not adapted to a county like
Amador; that some of its proisions
cannot be enforced, and as a whole
it is ery doubtful whether the law
would "stand the test of an appeal
to the; courts It is currently re
ported that the ordinance will either
be remodelled, or a new ordinance
passed along different lines by the
board of superisors at their next
meeting
The Calaeras Prospect says re
garding the republican nomination
for Assemblyman of this districtPersonal
"Amador is talking of two men, C
H McKenney, the present incum
bent, and H W Wood of the Ama
dor Record" We in Amador coun
ty were not aware that much "talk
ing" was going on Certainly this
statement of bur cotemporary is the
first blast we hae heard on this
subject The Ledger indulges the
hope that the republicans will put
up a man for the legislature who will
pay more regard to the introduction,
of remedial 'measures — measures
tending to reliee rather than in
crease the burdens of Personal taxpayers
The idea that the usefulness of a
statesman is gauged by the amount
of money he gets from the public
treasury to be expended in the terri
tory which he represents, is losing
popularity It has been shamelessly
abused What we want now, more
than at any time in our past history,
is a broadminded representatie
who will igorously apply the brakes
to the ruinous "getallyoucan"
policy The good fellow well met
is all right in his place, but just now
we need a man of nere to oppose
the many schemes floated from
moties of self interest, rather than
public good
The methods of the Hearst boom
ers are illustrated by the following
communication, which is being sent
to country publishers throughout
the United States Papers of eery
political shade are inited to join the
Hearst procession by the free plate
serice route The Ledger is in re
ceipt of one of these gilded baits
We hae been in the newpaper
business for thirty years, but neer
before ran up against such a brazen
effort in behalf of a' selfconstituted
candidate to capture the presidency
by the influence of coin' If Hearst
succeeds in annexing the democratic
party to his' financial bureau — and
the outlook in that direction is by no
means discouraging to his managers
— he will no doubt continue the
same "yellow" methods throughout
the campaign The missie we re

handle struck him in the head' The
blow, fractured the fore part of  the

badly that it is feared he will lose the

Editor Amador LedgerPersonal—
Be kind enough to allow a small
space in your aluable paper to express
my opinion regarding Amador county
affairs , The reason I say aluable
paper is thisPersonal I consider the Ledger Is
the only paper that eer prints or pub
lishes one word in the interest of the
taxpayers Unless there is more
economy practiced by our county of
ficials in the near future, our property
will hae to be assessed still higher, or
the tax rate raised another notch aboe
what it is at present, and the Lord only
knows that our taxes are too high
already In looking oer the bills al
lowed by our buard of superisors at
their last regular meeting, I thought it
was a shame that the taxpayers should
be called upon to pay some of them
The expenses for the month of Feb
ruary, outside of schools, and most of
the rounty officers' salaries, was close
on to $5000 We paid $2570 for tele
phoning, which I don't think that we
ought to pay for In fact, one instru
ment in each building ought to be quite
sufficient to do all the county business
that is done in our court house, and I
don't think that we ought to be called
on to pay any more The idea of eery
county official haing a telephone is an
outrage on the people and ought to be
discontinued We used to get along
with county affairs before we had any
telephones, and our officers get more
salary now than they did then We
also paid a bill for traeling expenses
of $93— quite a big item We hae
plenty of legal business to attend to
right at home if our officers would
carry out the recommendations of the
grand jury and stop all gambling and
illegal games and deices

GKAVEYAR ESECRATION
How Jackson's City of the ead is
Treated
In all ages and among all nations the
burial places of the dead are held in re
spect bordering upon awe The tombs
of the ancients are the only , structures
that hae suried the raages of time
The pyramids of Egypt and the mounds
where the ancient cities of Nineah
and Babylon slept undisturbed for
centuries, testify to the feeling of awe
which possessed the ancients against
disturbing the silent abodes of the de
parted No matter how low down in
the scale of humanity a people may be,
this respect for burial places exists to a
greater or less degree The saage
and the Christian alike partake of this
spirit of eneration In ciilized lands,
the character of the people is gauged
in a great measure by the regard mani
fested to the spots where human re
mains are allowed to dissole again to
dust Jackson is not deficient in this
spirit of respect It would be a calumny
upon her citizens to say that any mani
festation of unconcern is shared in by
the people They are as sensitie on
this tender subject as any people, and
whateer reflection the facts stated in
this article may carry, we wish it to be
understood that the heart of the citi
zens generally pulsates in the right
direction
The public cemetery of Jackson has
been left to take care of itself It has
been in charge of eerybody in general
and nobody in particular Although
the superisors are the legally consti
tuted guardians of public graeyards
under such circumstances, heretofore
they hae exercised no superision
oer the burying ground of the county
seat With no one clothed with
authority to look after it, it has been
neglected to some extent, but not dis
respected
Last Saturday a cry of indignation
was raised by a report that seeral
men were engaged in cutting down the
natural shade trees within the in
closure The object of the cutting was
to secure firewood It was not to
beautify the grounds The expressions
of disapproal of these acts of spoilia
tion were loud and persistent An in
quiry was made as to who authorized
this work, but no satisfactory answer
could bo had Superisor Newman,
when asked about it, said that he had
not sanctioned it; and no one else could
gie een the color of authority for
such acts Owners of plots hae no
right to do this Fancy any person
walking into the Catholic graeyard
here, and cutting down trees right and
left, and justifying himself by saying
that the relaties of deceased persons
buried nearby had gien consent
Would the church authorities accept
such a shallow pretense? Would not
the trespassers be turned oer to
minions of the law? Can it bo sup
posed that a graeyard in charge of
public officials is not protected by law
to a like extent?
Sunday morning we isited the ceme
tery to see what had been done The
eastern portion, comprising fully one
half the total area, and tenanted mostly
by the indigent dead from the hospital,
was shorn of eery estige of 6hade
We counted eight stumps of oak trees
recently felled in this section, the
stumps standing about a foot aboe the
ground No attempt had been made
to grub them up by the roots The
purpose was plainly to get the wood,
and nothing else Nearly all tho wood
had been remoed, a few sticks only
remaining A lot of brush and debris
was piled up preparatory to burning
Blackened spots indicated where other
refuse, heaps had been burned The
amount of stoe wood secured in this
section is estimated at from six to eight
cords A few rough head boards usu
ally placed oer these graes were in
tact, but the majority were unmarked
and fragments of broken headboards
were strewed oer the ground It is a
wilderness of mounds — treeless, path
less, and neglected 
In the front or western half, de
oted to family plats and general burial
there are a few natie oaks left, afford
ing some protection against summer
heat But here, too, the work of the
despoilers was in eidence A few feet
inside the front fence two oaks had
been cut, the freshly chopped stumps
showing just aboe the ground Three
tombstones nearby bore eidences of
disturbance Two of these — one in
memory of Mrs Reed the other of Ar
thur Sneer, both erected in early days,
had' apparently just been reset The
fresh cement that held them to the
pedestal wUs all exposed, and sticks
were placed to hold them in positon
until the cement had time to set It
was plain that they had been disturbed,
whether knocked down by fallen trees
or taken down temporarily to aoid
damage we do not know Pieces of
decayed fencing, disturbed by the
wood choppers were thrown in confu
sion, oer partly inclosed plots One
man, a part of the time we were there,
was at work, engaged we beliee in re
setting the displaced monuments here
in referred to Just outside the front
fence other trees had been cut down,
a big pile of brush and a quantity of
wood still lay in the public roadway —
the tangible reward and the incentie
of the trespassers We might cite nu
merous other facts, but these will be
sutliciont

of ladies appeared before the local jus
tice to swear out warrants fur the ar
rest of four persons alleged to be guilty
of these doings The following section
of the penal code was cited as the basis
of the complaintPersonal
2% Eery person who willfully
and maliciously defaces, breaks, de
stroys, or remoes any tomb, monu
ment, or graestone, erected to any
deceased person, or any memento or
memorial, or any ornamental plant,
tree or shrub, appertaining to the
place of burial of a , human being, or
who shall mark, deface, injure, destroy,
or remoe any fencei post, rail, or wall
of any cemetery or graeyard, is guilty
of a misdemeanor ; 
This is plain enough, and who will
assert that the facts as stated aboe do
not come within the range of this legal
enactment There was some backing
and filling, and consultation in official
circles The ladies would not be side
tracked from their purpose, and in
sisted that warrants be issued; they
were eyewitnesses of the spoilers'
work, Finallypushedto the deciding
point, the justice, doubtless acting on
adice, flatly refused to issue warrants
It is mooted around that a few more
trees will probably bo cut down, and
then peace will bo proclaimed ; that is
understood to mean that when the pub
lic graeyard is shorn of eery  estige
of natural shade, the andalism will
cease Recently Amadorcounty's legal
department distinguished itself by try
ing to punish an editor for acknow
ledging receipt of a feed of deer meat

state officials were made to trael'* SCO

The issue was deemed by the same 
worthy tribunal of sufficient importuned
to be submitted to a jury But when
it coraos to the exercise of authority
to protect the sanctity which the law
throws around the city of the dead,
justice sits bound or paralyzed What

much as it draws an outside element to

months to accommodate the single

purchase refreshments' No man is
either asked or compelled to spend one

7th No performer or employe of
the Xchange— male or female — has eer
been publicly intoxicated, or caused
any trouble to the officers If they
did, they would be instantly discharged,

THE PRESTON SCHOOL FIRE
Official Report of the Trustees Thereon
How Fire Started Unknown
The trustees of the Preston School
met in lone last week, and after a full in
estigation issued the following reportPersonal
To His Excellency, George C Pardee,
Goernor of the State of California
We ; hae inestigated the circum
stances of the fire which occurred at 
the Preston School of Industry on the
night of March 22, 190, and accom
panying this report is a transcript of j
the testimony taken ';Personal '
Upon our inestigations we hae
based the following conclusionsPersonal
The beginning of the fire was in the
attic of the Trades building, and it was
discoered by the outside night watch i
man at about 8Personal5 p m There was
stored in this part of the Trades build
ing a lot of material more or less in 1
flammable, consisting of pine lumber,
old furniture, some cocoa matting, et
cetera Two of the windows of the at
tic were opened toward a smoke stack,
outside the building and four or fie
feet from the wall, the top of which
was some ten or fifteen feet aboe these 
open windows The windows were 
open to admit the guy ropes of the
smoke stack, and this arrangement
had been in force since the boiler for 
the laundry had been set, about, four ' 
years ago
We find that the electric wires which
entered the attic were dead wires, not;
being in use Therefore it would not
hae been possible for the fire to origi 
nate from the electric wires in the attic,  1 1
Should a fire hae originated from the 
electric wires in any part of the build
ing where such wires were In use,' the "
fuses would hae blown out in that part "
of the building and the lights hae been
extinguished As the eidence shows
that the lights were burning after the
fire had started, no short circuit could
hae occurred '• '» ~
We can only conclude that " the fire
originated by spontaneous combustion, "
or that a spark blown from the smoke
stack into the open window of the at
tic, or through the entilators in the 
roof, ignited the combustible material "
stored there
Knowing that the ordinary mind is < '
likely at once to jump to the "conclusion
that the fire was incendiary, we in
estigated this phase of the matter
most thoroughly The eidence shows ;
that the attic, where we suppose the 
fire, originated, was kept securely lock
ed, and the key held in the possession i
of but one officer, the carpenter; The "
last time the attic had been isited by •
any one was some six weeks ago, when' 
the blacksmith had occasion to go there
after a piece of furniture And from
that day until the time of the fire no
person, to our knowledge, had entered
the attic
Within a few minutes of the time it
started, the fire was discoered by the 
night watchman, who promptly gae
the alarm The superintendent was",
the first to arrie at the building after
the alarm had been gien He was
followed immediately by all the officers
not on duty with the boys, who were
all in bed asleep and knew nothing of
the fire Many of the citizens of the
town came quickly to the help of the
school, and with the officers rendered
such efficient serice that a portion of
the laundry machinery was saed by
checking the fire in that part of the
building
The walls of the building remain in
tact, and, so far as we can tell from our
inestigation, are not damaged to  any '
extent The entire inside of the build
ing from the foundation to the roof,
with the exception aboe mentioned,
was completely consumed, together 
with its contents, comprising the stock
and equipment of the carpenter shop, I 
laundry," photographer's, printing '
shop, shoe shop and tailor shop We 
estimate the total loss to the state at
from $12,000 to $15,000

BURGLARY AN ROBBERY
A Suing Attempt to Bob the Last
Chance Saloon
One of the most daring burglaries we
hae been called upon to chronicle was
committed at the Last Chance saloon
during Monday night This saloon is
situated at the north end of Main
street, Jackson, opposite the bridge
oer tho north fork The proprietors
are Airolde& Ouliali It does a large
business, tbe patrons being mostly
ItaliansPersonal A small fire proof safe' ls in
tbe front part of the barroom behind
tbe bar, tbe front "of the safe facing
east, leaing a narrow passage way for
the bartender not more than three
feet wide It was tho contents of this
safe that furnished the incentie to the
crime In timed past tbe proprietors
hae kept considerable money in the
safe, but latterly it has been the cus
tom to deposit in the bank when the
cash amounted to between $100 and
$200 Monday night the saloon was
closed about 11Personal30 o'clock No one
sleeps on the premises So that from
that hour till about 6 o'clock Tuesday
morning the burglars had a clear field
for their  operations Eerything
points to the fact that the safecrackers
wero thoroughly conersant with the
premises, and also that they were green
hands at that business It is thought
that at least two and probably three
persons are implicated in the crime
They appeared ou the sceue fully armed
with all the implements of warfare, as
they thought Their weapons con
sisted of a 16 Ib sledge hammer and
a braceandbit Both implements
were left in tbe saloon The sledge
hammer has been identified as one used
at the blacksmith shop at the Ken
nedy mine, while the braceandbit was
taken from the north shaft of the same
mine
Entrance to the saloon was effected
through the side or north door of the
barroom, which opens upon the bowling
alloy Here they could operate with
out being seen from the street With
the braceandbit four holes were bored
through the door'just aboe the lock
A blow easily knocked out a piece of
tbe door, sufficiently large to enable
the hand to be introduced, and there
by undo the side catch on tbe lock by
which the door was fastened The door
of the safe was next tackled  with the
sledge hammer The hinges were
knocked off, the combination entirely
destroyed All this was eidently done
under the impression that the door
would fall open if the hinges were re
moed Finding that it was still firm
in its place, the robbers secured other
tools Breaking open a door leading
to rooms in the rear of the barroom
they got a hatchet and an ax, and with
these again assaulted the safe Using
tbe hatchot as a wedge they ripped
open the front of the safe for four or
fie inches from the top" igging
through the cement casing they en
countered the inner steel, and with this
obstacle confronting them they must
hae oted their adenture a failure
All the implements were left on the
promises A dozen fragments of the
broken safe testify to tbe determined
character of the attack
Tho men worked by the light of a
candle, spots of grease are scattered on
the top of the safe, and a small piece of
candle, not more than an inch long,
was left as a memento Tho contents
of the till were taken, amounting to
not more than two or thren dollars
The proprietors, on opening up Tues
day morning, were astonished to see
the way things had been wrecked The
officers wero notified, aud Sheriff Nor
man and deputies wont promptly to
work to ferret out the perpetrators

EATH OF JOHN FOSTER
John Foster, an old and respected
citizen of Amador county, suddenly
and unexpectedly departed this life last
Saturday morning Mr Foster was at
one time an inmate of the county hos
pital, but for the past three years has
been liing in the old Canepa cabin, on
a mining claim near the Mokelumne
rier, owned by John Grillo of Vol
cano One day last week Messrs Mc
Lain and Shepard discoered that the
old gentleman was in a helpless condi
tion, not being able to supply himself
with the necessaries of life They at
once proided him with proper food
and clothing, and notified Superisor
Grillo that he wished to be taken to
the hospital Early Saturday morning
Grillo sent his brother James with a
carriage to take the old gent to Jack
son The carriage could only be taken
to within 300 yards of the cabin, and it
was necessary for Foster to either walk
or bo carried that distance After eat
ing a hearty breakfast, and being sup
ported on either side by his friends,
McLain and Shepard, he walked to the
carriage, seemingly without any great
effort Here he was gien a light
stimulant, and being comfortably seat
ed in the carriage he bade his friends
goodbye and started for the hospital
All went well until they had drien
about three miles, when Grillo noticed
that his companion had ceased talking
and seemed uncomfortable When
asked how be felt be replied, "Not
ery well" Grillo then said, "'o you
know me," and Foster replied, "Yes,
you are Jim Grillo" By this time
James noticed the 'death stare in his
eyes, and held him upright in the car
riage His head dropped to one side,
a slight gurgle in his throat, and the
old man passed peacefully away Grillo
droe to a conenient spot, tied his
team securely, and went 'to Mattley's
station and telephoned to his brother
for instructions as to what was best to
do Superisor Grillo notified tho
coroner, who gae instructions to bury
the deceased in Volcano James Grillo
then droe to Mattley's, where, with
the assistance of Will Mattley, the re
mains were laid out to await the ar
rial of the dead wagon, which was
dispatched with all possible haste Ar
riing in town the corpse was taken to
the undertaking parlors of Grillo 8r03,
where it was prepared for interment
eceased had no relaties in this state
He died among friends, who saw that
he had a Christian burial, and the li
ing will sco that his grae is kept green

NOTES FROM
THE MINERS
Bdnker Hill— The first cleanup
of the new twenty stamp mill was made
last week  The mill, owing to an acci
dent to the rockbreaker, was not kept
running to its ' full capacity for tbe
whole month, only ' ten stamps being
kept in motion a part of the time We
are not able to gie the exact figures of
the cleanup, except that tbe , month's
run aeraged something oer $6 per
ton, which is a ery satisfactory record,
and leaes a good margin of profit
The ore came mostly from the 1200 foot
leel, which is of poorer grade then
the ledge in the 800 and 100 leels
The cleanup is highly satisfactory to
the stockholders ' ••'V'"*&
ZEiLAi — The underground, workers
were laid off temporarily at this mine
last Tuesday This step was imperatie
because of tbe immense olume, of
water flowing into the works, requiring
the constant working of tbe water
tanks to Personal preent the flooding of the
loels' \ There is considerable compara
tiely leel land about the Zeila, with
some depressions, acting as a reseroir
for the surface water Most of it drains
down into the mine' Owing to these
exceptional conditions, while other
mines in the wet season hae  about
double the amount of water to handle
as compared with normal conditions,
the Zeila has fully six times as much
It j was found impossible to keep the
mill supplied with ore, and keep the
water down at the same time Hence
the stamps were hung up, and the
miners laid off A few days of fine
weather will cause the water to slacken
and mining operations to be resumed

some sacks of potatoes in a store room,
he came upon a nest of rats, seen in
all The room is lined, and in looking
oer the walls he saw tbe old rat and
ton halfgrown ones Whereer ho
would seo a rat he would place his hand
aboe it and work it down until he
found an opening, then he would take
them out and put them in a wire trap
They had seen halfgrown rats alie
at one time in the trap, and the noise
they made was like the chattering of a
nest of magpies

ALEXANROVITCH
WILLIAM H OSBORNE
Copyright, HW1, by T C McOlure
Alexandroltch was a man with a
memory— a memory of deatli Alex
androltch was still young, almost a
boy, but he was younger then, when
he had met death and walked part way
with her hand In hand It was sum
mer now, but then it had been winter
Alexandroitch, for the nonce cast out
of good employment, had started in on
Shankowitch's mare to trudge from
one illage to another
He did not make a fine appearance
altogether His clothes were thin, and
he had tted^his hands and feet in bur
laps—burlaps picked up in the gutter—
and he had started off Remember,
this had been some years ago He had
started out, bending his muscular body
to the gale, pressing on in the teeth of
the wind
He had started out; that was all He
remembered but little else, for he was
but onethird of the way out of Nodo
losk when the blizzard struck him But
on he went, running briskly to keep
the blood warm in his limbs and fol
lowing the road as best he could And
then there had come a time when he
felt his ery soul freeze within him
He cried aloud in agony But he press
ed on
Suddenly all this was changed In
place of the cold a drowsy warmth
spread oer him He thought that he
was lying wrapped in furs before some
great log fire Red flames danced be
fore hia eyes Alexandroitch thought
that he danced and laughed aloud, he
felt so comfortable But he did not
He was simply staggering through the
deep snow, his head lolling from side
to side and his dark eyes staring at a
cancy Finally he pitched headfore
most
""Ah," muttered Alexandroiteh to
himself pleasantly, "this is indeed a
bed of down! Now shall I sleep and
sleep and sleep"
And Alexandroitch slept And the
blizzard roared about him It was a
strange thing that but twele feet to
the right of Alexandroitch there was
a small cottage, almost coered with
the snow Inside was a young girl,
the daughter of Abrain Saratosky
Saratosky was a Jew, a Russian Jew
There was but one window to this cot
tage, and in this window sat the young
girl, closely wrapped up in a rug, for
the cold entered and the snow drifted
in through the pane of glass She was
peering out, watching the storm Now
the snow dashed against the house
and blinded her Then with a sudden
gust it would blow away and open up
a wide ista outdoors uring one of
these swirls the girl caught a glimpse
of something dark that lay prone upon
a bed of snow She shuddered This
girl was alone The family bad gone
to market at a nearby illage There
they would stay until the storm had
spent its force Anna Saratosky peer
ed out at the dark spot in the snow
Obeying a sudden Impulse, she rose and
entured to the door * Then she re
turned
"It is nothing," she assured herself
"It is not a man I am seeing sights
It is the storm" Again she peered out
"It is— it is a man," she exclaimed to
herself— "a man who will surely freeze
to death 1"
She gathered her rug close about her
Then with sudden energy she threw
open the little door and staggered, buf
feted by the storm, across the space
of twele feet It might just as well
hae been twele yards The storm,
which had designs upon Alexandro
itch, preented her from reaching
him  But only for a time Making an
extra effort, she cast off the rug that
hampered her, and then, with a sudden
leap, she plunged forward and fell
prone upon the dark object by the road
side The object stirred
lie is alie," exclaimed Anna Sara
tosky—"alie, and I must sae him!"
The next few moments made a wo
man out of a mere girl The work of
those few moments was the work of a
lifetime But she did it Fifteen min
utes later Anna Saratosky was rub
bing with snow the hands and face and
feet of a strong young man, who was
fair to look upon, and all the fairer be
cause he was In the alley of the shad
ow of death At last she was rewarded
Alexandroitch slowly opened his eyes
and looked into the face of a beautiful
young girl "You are one of the an
gels up in heaen," he murmured
She shook her bead "I am Anna
Saratosky," she answered
And all this was some years ago
In Am | Saratosky's illage Alex
androitch lied and moed and had
his being He was a Russian, and she
was a Jewess, but' to him she was one
of the angels up In heaen
It was early summer In the illage
One night without a sound 200 men
stole each from his house and met un
der coer of the darkness in the mar
ket place Suddenly a mighty shout
went up from them
"The Jews! The Jews!" they cried
"eath to the Jews!" That was the
beginning; after that, battle, murder,
eudden death, blood and flre, flre and
blood The men were Russians; their
neighbors were the Jews " Each man
turned upon his neighbor; each man
armed himself and struck and struck
and struck to kill They entered home
after home, dragging the innocents in
to the streets and slaughtering them
like cattle Alexandroitch was a Rus
sian He, too, sought a house He was
almost too late Two people of the
name of Saratosky lay weltering In
blood They lay there at their door
post, where Alexandroitch had lain so
many months before Alexandroitcb
looked upon them His heart bled with
pity
"If one could only hae foreseen all
this!" he cried "If I could hae but
known !" He shuddered not with fear,
but with dread He heard footsteps hi
the house  '""<
"Anna— Anna Saratosky 1" he cried
in a low oice He heard an inarticu
late sound Alexandroitch strode oer
the dead ' He sought tbe liing He
peered into the house In a corner a
silent struggle— a struggle to the death
—was belg fought It was a young
girl, Anna Saratosky, gagged, but
with free hands that she had torn clear
of their bonds, fighting for dear life
against two men It did not last long,
for Alexandroitch was ' there He
sprang into the midst and struck out
right and left
"So, so, Boroskl,"_be cried to one of
the men "It is you who are the das
tard That for you, Boroshi! And that
for you, Mongololtchl"
These two men were men that Alex
androitch knew as well as he knew
his brother, but it was all one now,
for there was murder in the heart of
Alexandroitch, een as there had been
murder In the heart of the two men,
for Alexandroitch was fighting for
something more than his own life, and
he was a maniac for , the instant — a
wild beast Finally, he drew his hand
across' his brow and turned to Anna
Saratosky Then he stepped back and
opened a rear door  ;
 "Anna Saratosky," he said, "thy fa
ther and thy mother are beyond  all
aid; none can help them now We must
een leae them where they are The
Holy Mother will protect them Come
Jjhou with me, Anna Saratosky" He
Wd not gie her time to hesitate He
#bglit her in his arms and forced her
hrough the open door
"Fly, Anna Saratosky!" he whisper
ed In her ear "Fly, for the flying
death comes after us"
It was a wild flight, that night of the
dread massacre But at last the two
had left pursuit behind As the day
began to break Alexandroitch reached
forth his arm and lifted from the
ground the form of the fainting girl
Then with his precious burden, he
Struck across the country He reached
a small, secluded 'and deserted stable
With the girl still In his arms he enter
ed They crouched there in a corner
Suddenly the girl burst into hysterical
weeping "My father and my rnoth
erl" she exclaimed "My father and
my mother!"
Alexandroitcb comforted her " There
was a long silence  between them
Suddenly Alexandroitch bent down
his head "Little one," "he whispered,
"thou art alone In this wide world,
tfhou didst sae me once from death,
kly life belongs to you and yours to me
Let us go through life together, little
one Today our faith is one— our creed
is loe"
Anna Saratosky citing to him
"Whither thou goest," she whispered,
"t will go Where thou lodgest I will
$dge Thy people shall be my people,
thy* God my God"
ifferent From a Mountain
 A certain Philadelphian, who is at
once a minister of the gospel and a reg
istered physician, had an amusing ex
perience in Ills attempt to corner a
Christian Scientist, according to the
Philadelphia Ledger
Eery time they met this scientist
took occasion to scoff at medical sci
ence and to dwell upon the wonders
that could be performed through faith
 "You are coninced that through faith
you can do anythiug," said the medical
man one day t
"Yes," he replied; "faith will moe
mountains"
A week later he was in the doctor's
office with a swollen Jaw, due to tooth
ache
"What! You here?" the doctor ex
claimed, 'with feigned astonishment
"Oh, doctor," be said "I hae suf
fered agony all through the night I
simply can't stand this pain any long
er"
"Hae you tried faith?" the physi
cian asked him "You know you told
me faith could moe mountains"
"But this is a caity, doctor"
A 'Worthy Man
When William E Chandler was in
the United States senate he was isit
ed by a delegation from his home town,
Concord, N H The object was to
hae Sir Chandler assist in selecting
a ' candidate for mayor of Concord
Name after name was offered to the
senator only to be rejected Finally a
delegate who was not especially pleas
ing to Mr Chandler askedPersonal "Well, who
in thunder do you want, anyway? How
are we going to know when a man
does possess the qualities that will en
title him to your approal?''
'•When you find a man who isn't
ashamed to show respect for women,
loe for children and animals and who
will walk to the edge of the sidewalk
at midnight when no one is watching
to do his expectorating Into the street
you may be sure that he possesses all
the ciic irtues and Is fully worthy
of any office you may be able to gie
him," was the quiet response
Washington Named It
The question, "Who 'named the Em
pire State?" Is often asked, but seldom
properly answered General Washing
ton is the man to whom that and many
other honors belong In his reply to
the "address of the common council of
New York city" the great general saidPersonal
"I pray that heaen bestow its choicest
blessings on your city; that a well reg
nlated and beneficial commerce may
enrich your citizens, and that your
state, at present the seat of empire,
may set such examples of wisdom and
liberality as shall hae a tendency to
strengthen and gie a permanency to
the Union at home and credit, and re
spectability abroad"
This la, of course, an inferential al
lusion, but was the origin of New
York's popular name neertheless

AnlmnlH Enjoy Racing;
Little pigs are great at combined
play, which generally takes the form
of races Emulation seems to form
part of their amusement, for their races
seem  always to hae the winning of
first place for their object and are quite
different from those combined rushes
for food or causeless stampedes In
which little pigs are wont to indulge
Racing is an amusement natural to
some animals and, being soon taught
by others, becomes one of their mosi
exciting pastimes— London TitBits

Pedicuring an Elephant
The tools, for trimming elephants' feet
are a carpenter's drawknife and a rasp
for the soles and a horseshoer"s knife
and sandpaper for the toe nails The
operator places a beer keg or a strong
box behjnd one huge hind foot, lightly
prods the thick ankle with his elephant
hook and commands tbe beast to ''Hold
up!" Up comes the mighty foot, slowly
and heaily, but obediently as the el
ety paw of a kitten The foot is rest
ed on the box or the keg, where it re
mains while the expert works on it
much as a horsesnoer pares the hoof of
a horse Great sliers of the horny
sole are sliced off until it is" cut nearly
to proper thickness, when the rasp is
used to smooth off Similarly the toe
nails are treated with the knife and the
sandpaper, while the big patient stands
with swinging trunk and an occasional
wag of an ear, too full of satisfaction
for utterance When the turn of the
forefoot comes, the great beast is made
to lie down on its side and the hoofs
are propped up and treated— McClure's
A Bird That Is Feared
The elster (Pica candata) is a bird
that la respected and feared through
out south Germany It belongs to the
raen tribe and Is about the size of a
doe, with black and white feathers
and long, pointed tall It builds its
nest in orchards, and its life Is sacred
If it Is seen three times in succession
on the same house top In a place re
mote from its home it is belieed to be
a sure sign of death in that house If
it flies and gies its peculiar cry the
sick person is sure to die, but If It
does not scream the patient may re
coer It is better for the sick per
son if the bird does not come near
No one could be hired to bother these
birds for fear they might seek reenge,
and if by chance one of them should
die it is a sign of bad luck to the owner
of the property where it is found
The bird Is a aluable insect destroyer
and in this way probably more than
compensates for the fear it occasions
among the farmers
Animals Become Insane
Insanity in the human subject is sup
posed by some to hae no analogue In
the lower animals Yet many cases,
according to r Sneilson, will lead to
the permanent loss of self control
Cattle drien from the country through
a crowded town will often work
themseles into a frenzy Horses
hae gone mad on the battlefield At
Balaklaa an Arabian horse turned on
its attendant,' threw him down and,
kneeling on him, attacked him like an
infuriated dog An instance is related
of a docile horse suddenly going mad
on a hot day Eerything that came
in its way it seized in its teeth and
shook as a terrier does a rat A scien
tist of authority een goes so far as to

Happiness '
"I am sometimes accused," writes
Sir John Lubbock, "of being too op
timistic But I hae neer ignored nor 
denied the troubles and sorrows of life
I hare neer said that men are happy,
but only that they might be; that if
they are not so the fault is generally
their own; that most of us throw away
more happiness than we enjoy" i
