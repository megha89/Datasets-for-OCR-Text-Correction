rt of iination In the Bowels ol
the En rlli Explained
There ia undoubtedly a practical art
of discoering 1 springs Indians ot
frontiersmen can find water in the des
ert when a "'tenderfoot" cannot Mexi
cans and experienced prospectors can
similarly find ore These arts consist
inainly in the recognition of superficial
signs which escape the ordinary ob
serer
It is not necessary that the operator
should consciously note these signs
separately and reason upon them No
doubt he frequently does so, though ho
may not gie away the secret of his
method to others But , in many in
stances he recognizes by association
and memory the presence of a group
of indications, great or small, which he
has repeatedly, found to attend springs
or ore deposits Tl>s skill, due to habit,
is often almost unerring for a gien
limited district, but under new condi
tions it breaks down Old miners from
California or ' ustralia hae often
made in other regions the most foolish
and hopeless attempts to find gold be
cause they thought this or that place
"looked just like" some other place in
which tl»ey had mixed successfully
part from the magnetic minerals
there is no proof that ore deposits ex
hibit their presence and nature by any
attraction or other actie force With
regard to water, howeer, there may
be an action affecting the temperature
and moisture of the oerlying surface
Een here, howeer, It seems more
likely that such effects are manifested
isibly to a close obserer rather than
by direct affection of his nerous or
muscular system The faorite fields

ONE CUSE OF ILLNESS
Rldlcnlous Fnda That Spring; From a
Smatterlns of Knowledge
 famous physician upon being asked
recently what is the chief cause of ill
health repliedPersonal Thinking and talking
about It all the time This ceaseless
introspection in which so many of the
rising generation of nerous folk in
dulge is certainly wearing them out
When they are not worrying as to
whether they sleep too much or too lit
tle they are fidgeting oer the amount
of food they take or the quantity of ex
ercise necessary for health In short,
they neer gie themseles a moment's
peace Our grandfathers did not con
cern themseles with these questions
They ate, drank, slept, as nature
prompted them Undoubtedly they
were healthier in mind and body for
their sublime indifference, and if we
asked ourseles fewer questions we
should hae less time to analyze or im
agine ailments
That medical science has made re
markable progress in the last few dec
ades cannot be denied The fault for
some presen Way undesirable conditions
lies not with the doctor, but with the
patient There has been too great a
tendency on the part of the Ifiity to ac
quire a smattering of medical knowl
edge through the reading of so called
"health" magazines and pamphlets and
to put into practice on their own ac
count that "little knowledge," which, it
cannot be denied, is a "dangerous
thing" The following of some most
ridiculous fads along the lines of eat
ing, drinking, sleeping and exercise has
assisted In swelling the mortality sta
tistics Our grandfathers would hold
up their hands i horror at many of tho
foolish things we do in the name of
"health"  little more of the com

The One
Letter
CHNNING POLLOCK
Copyright, 190, by Channinc Pollock
fter they had come to an under
Btamling Frank Claxton took Virginia
Carter to dinner at Gloranf s This un
derstanding, the result of many misun
derstandings, put an end to their en
gagement, and they chose to hold the
wake oer their dead loe at the tiny
restaurant where It had been born
Neither talked much during the meal,
and when either, spoke, for some rea
son not easily explained, it was in a
ery low tone The man said, "I sup
pose I had better return your letters ?'
"There must be a great many of
them," responded the girl, the corners
of her mouth trembling Into a faint
smile
"Yes In— in three years"—
"I shall send yours tomorrow — that
is, I shall send all but one I should like
to keep one— ln memoriam May I?"
"If I may"
"Certainly ' fair exchange,' you
know"
Claxton left her at the door of her
apartment something less than an hour
later On the way to his own home he
mareled that he should regret what
had happened so little The petty quar
rels of the past few mouths had worn
out his endurance, he thought, and ren
dered him indifferent to meir culmina
tion, lie wondered how she felt about
it t all eents, the separation would
leae him with' more time — more time
to work, more time to deote to the
friends he had neglected since he had
begun caring for her
In the matter of the quarrels he did
not consider himself blameless He
realized this, and admired himself a bit
for the inherent generosity which pre
ented his hojding her solely to ac
count
Claxton reached his "place" In rather
a relieed frame of mind He opened
the door with a key fastened to a siler
riuj? that she had gien him on his
birthday and walked straight across
the library to his typewriter Beside
the machine was a tiny cushion she
had made for him to rest his elbow
upon when he was "reading copy" He
recalled that it had come wrapped in
numberless pieces of paper, each one
inclosed "inside the other, like the eggs
In a Chinese puzzle That was about
tho time that the Interest aroused by
his tale of Central merican life had
opened the hearts of editors toward
him
Somehow the detectie story he had
intended to begin did not fly from his
finger tips as speedily as he had ex
pected The first paragraph, after
writing which, ho told himself, things
would go better, stood alone on the
page, a succession of stilted and unin
iting sentences
"Not in tho mood," he confessed at
last and strolled down Broadway to his
club The boy at the door didn't know
him, and when, after satisfying the stu
pid fellow of his membership, he saun
tered into the lounging room he was
in an exceedingly unpleasant humor
"Parsons been here this eening?" he
inquired brusquely of an attendant
"Xo, sir," renjicd' the man "He does
not come ery often now, sir Married,
I beliee"
Claxton cursed Parsons from the bot
tom of his soul
"Graham?" he asked
"Mr Graham was In about a week
ago We don't see him more than once
a fortnight"
"Funny," mused Claxton "By George,
I wonder If there's any one In the
place?"
There was, in the writing room
Frederick Ford Ferguson, a youth Just
coaxing a timorous mustache Into ex
istence and tolerated only for the sake
of his father, Major Ferguson, former
ly of the Ninth infantry Claxton
would gladly hae passed the young
ster by, but he was bailed before he
could regain tho hall
"Stop a bit, old chap I want to read
you a line I'm sending to a friend of
mine at aly's Rather a cleer letter,
you know"
Claxton tore himself away and went
back home What was Miss Carter do
ing? He would hae wagered a hun
dred that Phelps had called and taken
her out Confound Phelps!
The story ent more smoothly, stim
ulated by the resentful energy of its
author From 10 o'clock until nearly
daylight the typewriter clicked inces
santly When it stopped clicking, seen
pages of manuscript, much marred by
pencil marks, lay on the table near at
hand It was a good story, he felt sure,
although there were two or three de
tails concerning which he would hae
liked a conseratie opinion "I'll take
Virginia out for luncheon and read It
to her," he thought Then he remem
bered that they had agreed neer to
see each otter again— oluntarily, that
is
Tho day, which began with his rising
at noon, dragged along monotonously
It was hard to realize that he might
not speak to her oer the telephone that
stood on his desk and harder still to be
coninced that she would not call him
up Toward midafternoon Claxton un
locked a drawer and took out the nine
packages of her letters that represent
ed a correspondence of three years He
must choose the cue letter and return
the rest to her
To do this he must read eery epis
tle in tho nine bundles Claxton, in
common with most men who write or
act, was a sentimentalist, and he want
ed that the one letter should be the
dearest of all The first that met hla
eye he laid aside in the belief that It
would proo the dearest Mies Carter

it San Jose de Guatemala "Your ca
ble was repeated to me at Chicago,"
was the message "Otherwise I should
hae been with you now I know that
if your illness continued you would
need a nurse, and I felt that I could
not delegate to strangers the priilege
3f attending you" It was a Wpnanly
letter— the letter of a woman   iture In
heart and brain— and Claxton pondered
i long while before putting it aside
Next came a telegram • pent to his
apartments before the telephone had
been installedPersonal "Please come tonight
m blue Hae wired Minnie stPersonaliy
home"  ery sweet, dependent lit
tle message, but of course not to be
thought of aa the single memento of
so close a friendship as theirs had
been It was een preferable to retain
the short note which he h;td iihtys
ascribed to her literary genius rfltjer
than to her feelings "Each thought of
you, dropping into the waters of my
heart, produces eer, widening circles
of tender recollection"
Then there was an enelope froai
her, on the back of which he had comp
osed a fragment of erse It beganPersonal
Thou art bo dear to me my loe—
So dear and, oh, so necessary!
Claxton remembered that she hid
prized the poem aboe anything o'se
he had gien her "It is so fine to be
thought 'necessary,' " she had said
In this manner he progressed through
fie of the nine packages Each leiier
seemed more desirable than the rest,
and eery moment made a selection
less easy This scrawl was a reassur
ance which she had penciled on the
leaf of her programme at the theater;
that sheet of blue paper bore the first
words of affection he had eer receied
from her
t the bottom of the fifth bundle was
a long enelope with the name of a
publishing company on its upper left
hand corner The postmark was oer
two years old "Rejected manuscript,"
Claxton concluded, tossing It to one
side contemptuously That had come
back in the days when rejected manu
scripts had not been half so rare as
good dinners or money with which to
pay rent Something approaching cu
riosity made him pick up the enelope
again and draw the contents from its
mouth The story that lay before him
was headed, "From Frank Claxton, ?' I
West Twentyfirst Street," but the
type unmistakably belonged to the ma
chine which still remained a fixture
at Miss Carter's The tale was one
that she had sent oer his signature to
an editor of whose opinion she had felt
certain, and itjiad in consequence been
returned to hfm when that gentleman
had classed it as "unaailable" "I
thought you'd get a check," Virginia
had confessed, "and I knew you'd
spend It without considering whys and
wherefores It's just like Phelps! He
was enthusiastic oer the plot when I
told it to him last week"
"Virginia," he had remonstrated, "it
was like offering me charity"
 "Nonsense! I shouldn't hae thought
of handing you money I simply wrote
a story for you tha{ you might hae
written yourself If you had taken
time"
"Taken time! Good Lord, how much
time be bad taken that year in just
such discouraging, unremuneratie la
bor I How unhappy he had been and
how awfully, awfully hard up! He
hadn't begun spending eery eening"
with her then, and he hadn't begun
selling whateer he wrote either "No
body eer did— at first," she had as
sured him
For twenty minutes Claxton sat si
lently on his chair island in the middle
of a sea of letters His fingers clung
to the rejected manuscript, but his eyes
looked beyond it into the past ll the
half forgotten history, of his loe for
Virginia Carter had been recalled to
him with wonderful iidness— her un
arying goodness, the sweetness" of
their intercourse, the erstwhile strength
of his affection for her  ship's clock
in the adjoining room struck 2, the
nautical fashion of saying that the hour
was 5, and with quick resolution he be
gan climbing into his eening clothes
"I'e come fo take you to dinner," lie
said to Miss Carter when she respond
ed to his pressure on the button at her
door
"So you were lonely, too?" she asked
him
"Lonely? By George, and those let
ters"—
She was too cleer a girl not to seem
surprised, and he could not look
through the sides of her trunk into the
tray where reposed seeral packages
of his letters to her, unsearched, un
touched, since first they had been read
and laid away

The Chaplain's
Cleerness
C B Lewis
Copyright, 190, by C B Lewis
one' day at the Third National bank,
In the city of Cornopolis, a stranger
walked through the president's room
and past the bookkeeper's and took
from the pile of money stacked at the
paying teller's right hand four pack
nges of §10,000 each He was^coolly
walking out again when stoppedl>y the
president and a gun ' >
The man was known to the police bs
"Slick Charlie," and to tell of all his
adentures would fill a book It was
foj£his' attempted theft of the $0,000
that he was scut to the Woonson peni
tentiary for fie years The officer who
deliered him behind the doors of that
institution said to the wardenPersonal
"Here>is a man you want to keep an
eye on on't lose sight of him day
or night He is bold and nery on the
one hand and slick and sly on the
other on't trust him for an hour,
or he'll beat the game"
The warden was a new man at the
prison; but, haing been sheriff of a
county, he thought he knew about all
sorts of criminals and replied that
No J 870, as "Slick Charlie" was re
corded, would hae to get up early in
the morning to beat him
If a prison chaplain were to be ques
tioned abont religion" in a "prison he
would answer that scores of prisoners
lied up to it and were earnest and de
out If an experienced warden were
to be questioned, he would answer that
just when a prisoner began to "set
good" he should be watched tho closest
The 'chaplain at Woonson was a good
man and one who had faith In him
self' He thought his adice and ap
peals to burglars and murderers pro
duced the desired effect mong the
prisoners he was known as an easy
mark
The new warden was wary of antag
onizing the captain and a man not
well posted on the tricks of criminals,
so No S7O found things easy for him
when he entered prison When he had
hadf full opportunity to size up the
chaplain he began to "set good" He
was as earnest about this as ho had
been in appropriating other people's
goods Ho became contrite and hum
ble, and he wanted to be turned from
paths of wickedness Of course the
chaplain did his best When the po
lice officials heard that "Slick Charlie"
had been conerted they notified the
warden in writing that he would be

out of the "pen" within three months,
and the chaplain sent an official com
plaint to the goernor that the police
were trying to discredit his labors
The chaplain was a man fortyfie
years old, while No 870 was only thir
ty The chaplain was four Inches the
taller, had stoop shoulders and sham
bled as he walked He also had a pe
culiar intonation The slick conict
gae up his original idea of digging for
liberty to study the chaplain  t the
end of fie months he was one of the
teachers in the eening school t the
end of seen he asked and got liberty
to hold a Bible class on Sundays He
wrote and the chaplain deliered a ser
mon on "Christianity In Prison," which
was commented on by hundreds of pa
pers Up to this time he had been
working in the tailor shop He was
now gien charge of the prison library,
and his plans were as good as carried
out
It wa3 the habit of tbe chaplain to
isit the prison eery afternoon from
3to 5  part of the time was spent
with prisoners in their cells— men who
were undergoing light punishment—
and a part in tho library, and he al
ways left pretty promptly at 5 In go
ing out he passed three guards at lock
ed gates and went through the ward
en's office and out of the main door
No 870 had held the position of libra
rian for three months, and It was mid
winter One afternoon the chaplain
had been isiting in the prison aud re
turned to the library at a quarter of 5
s he entered the room he receied a
blow that knocked him senseless, and
when he recoered his wits half an
hour had passed and he was tied hand
and foot and gagged It was C o'clock
before he was released 
In the course of that hour No 870
had done some wonderful things ft

bud secured his man with ropes and
locked the door behind him as he
emerged Shambling down the corri

"James, I came away today with
only a dime in my pocket Can you
lend me a dollar until tomorrow?''
"With the greatest of pleasure, chap

The same game had been played on
ii!e two others, and then the "chap

He could hae passed right through, as
the official Twas busy, but instead of
that he took a chair and waited for
ten minutes When the warden was
iit liberty he was asked for a loan of

him on the welfare of three or four dif
ferent prisoners before saying good
uisut Fifteen minutes after leaing
the prison the disguised prisoner en
tered the largest store i the town and
borrowed ?20 of the merchant ' and
then disappeared •
 When the library door was broken
open at 0 o'clock and the real chaplain
found there was a great commotion
Three gatemen were ready to swear
that the clergyman had passed out,
taking a dollar from each as he did so
The warden had seen and talked and
loaned money to the same man Two
guards had also seen him Here were
six prison officials who could swear to
a thing, and yet that thing was not a
fact No 870 had simply imitated the
chaplain down to a line— his oice,
gait, speech and general look
t 11 o'clock the next forenoon the
president of the Third National bank
of Cornopolis" was called out of his
room for a moment 'uring hjs ab
sence a man dressed like one of the
clerks in the bank entered the room

TWENTY YERS' SLEEP
Up Van "Winkle's Case May Hard
Been More Fact Than Fiction
Een superficial students of folklore
tnow that the tale of Rip Van Winkle,
supposing that Iring really heard it in
the old utch settlements along the
Hudson, Is by no means peculiar to
that district, but Is found in some form
or other all oer the world In other
words, the Idea that it is possible for a
human being to surie In a state of
unconsciousness for a ery long time
would jseem to be either a uniersal
fancy or to be founded on some actual
experience
r Lancereaux in the Paris Bulletin
of the cademy of Medicine reports
such on experience, the case of a wo
man who actually did, so far as intelli
gent consciousness was concerned,
sleep almost exactly twenty years
p"atient, of a neurotic and hyster
ical family, had always been delicate
and nerous On May SI, 1883, she
was seerely frightened and fell Into
iolent hysteria, which after twenty
four hours passed into j unconscious
ness In this condition, Interrupted e
ery month or six weeks by sudden con
ulsie attacks, she lay until May 23,
1903, kept alie entirely by injections
of nourishment
On May 23 she was seized with hys
teria similar to that at the beginning
of her sleep, and the next day there
was another conulsion On May 25
she began definitely to recoer con
sciousness and  by the next day was
able to speak intelligently of eents
before her sleep and could also remem
ber from day to day since her waking
Of happenings during her sleep, such
as the drawing of some of her teoth,
she knew nothing On the eening of
May 28 she died peacefully
The particular case is of interest
chiefly to the medical profession, but
the general fact of surial in uncon
sciousness for a ery long tune shows
how such tales as those of the Sleeping
Beauty, the Seen Sleepers of Ephesus
and Ilip Van Winkle, to mention only
the most familiar examples, could hae
originated from actual experience and
obseration Very likely such cases oc
curred more than once
"Truth is stranger than fiction," runs
the old saying It "is undoubtedly more
correct to say that fiction is merely en
larged, reduced, distorted and other
wise decorated fact and that without
a fact within general knowledge from
which to start fiction could not exist
It Is entirely safe to conjecture that at
some prehistoric period, sleeping not
out of doors, of course, but under shel

THE SOCILISTIC RIFT
The adocates of socialism belong
almost exclusiely to the thriftless,
improident class One of the
orators of that propaganda address
ing an audience in Jacks m recently,
diided society into two classes,
namely, propertyowners and non
property owners Those who suc
ceeded in accumulating something,
and those who failed or neglected so
to do It is human nature the world
oer for the man who has nothing,
whether as the result of his own
shiftlessness or of misfortune it
matters not, to rail at conditions as
they exist, and seek to change the
same by a diision with the thriftier
class ccording to the tenets of
socialism it is aH wrong to own
property, whether of land or mo
able effects, as indiiduals ll
wealth, they claim, is the product of
human toil, and should belong to
society as a whole, and uot to indi
idual members thereof ll dis
tinctions of rich and poor should be
abolished The world owes eery
man a liing, and nothing more
With proper adjustment there is
enough for all, and to spare, and the
social system should be so managed
that eery one should be doled out
his portion from the common fund
The incentie to action— the desire
to accumulate property — which,
under the present system is the
dominant trait of character, would
be done away with The whole
fabric of society would be changed
with this disappearance of the rul
ing motie to make headway in the
world, as it is now generally under
stood Some will contend that
practically this would mean the
death blow to ambition Not so
mbition is inseparable from human
nature It cannot be throttled by
any conceiable change in conditions
ammed up in one direction, it will
manifest itself in another The sub
stitution of the cooperatie system
— socialism — for indiidual owner
ship, would remoe human ambition
from the main channel in which it
now flows under the present system
It does not follow, howeer, that
men would be ambitionless under
the altered conditions Indeed, it is
argued that this most potential
force in the human maketip would
simply be turned to more useful
channels The desire to excel would
manifest itself in the arts and
sciences, in the sphere of inention,
'and in fact in eery department of
human actiity
The purpose of this article is not
to discuss the agaries of socialism,
as that ague method of goernment
is generally understood We are
apt to dismiss such doctrines as
merely the teachings of discontented
and impracticable dreamers The
talk that it is the coming political
issue in the United States may be a
correct forecast of the future t
any rate it is a long way froai being
a pressing issue just now If it eer
does reach a position as a liing po
litical question, there is little doubt
that the intelligence of the merican
oter will thrust it away in the back
ground It is undeniable howeer
that a great deal of our law making —
or the propositions emanating from
the law making bodies — are fashioned
after the socialistic pattern The
tendency is to shift the burden of
maintenance from the indiidual to
the community at large The state
treasury is looked upon in a great
measure as the common fund, to be
drawn from those who hae acquired
something, for the support of those
who are needy Eyery successie
legislature witnesses a drift more or
less pronounced in this direction
Perhaps if the framers of these
measures were twitted with socialis
tic leanings they would indignantly
repudiate the impeachment But
the fact remains that the burden of
lawmakers is to strike down the
spirit of selfreliance and independ
ence in the indiidual, and place the
burden of responsibility upon society
or goernment The state is, in an
eer increasing ratio, placed in a
paternal light It is the state's
proince to look after the bringing
up of the child from infancy to man
hood, and to take care of him een
after reaching the age of maturity
Numerous instances might be cited
in proof of this assertion Our
statesmanship is deeloping along
the lines that eerything essential
to good citizenship should be free
The more items are placed on the
free list, the more efficient the go
ernment will become It is extreme
ly doubtful whether this position is
tenable s a rule, free things are
seldom appreciated at their real
alue It is when the object sought
is reached through struggles and
sacrifices, that success in any par
ticular path is properly appreciated
The spirit of selfreliance should be
fostered aboe eerything else
That is the true bulwark of any
nation
This tendency to lean upon the
goernment, is seen in the drift of
bills in eery legislature that con
enes n act recently introduced
proiding for free text books in the
schools is a case in point nd the
discussion thereon seres to accent
uate the tendency One legislator
said as a reason for passing the bill,
that he knew of children that were
kept from school because of inability
of the parents to buy the school
books This play to the galleries
was no doubt considered a bullseye
hit— a clinching argument He
might hae added that children were
kept out of school from want of foot
gear and other articles of clothing,
and argued that a bill should be
passed to furnish free clothing for
all to meet such isolated cases It
would be eery whit as reasonable
as to proide free text books for all,
simply because one per cent perhaps
are unable to buy for themseles
The attache nuisance — taking
money from the public treasury to
pay politicaldebts — is in the same
line of business lso the idea that
perades more or less eery part
of the state, that incites members to
quarter public buildings and institu
tions within the boundaries of their
respectie districts It is nothing
less than a clearcut reersal of the
relationship of citizens to the go
ernment—namely, that it is the duty
of the citizen to support the go
ernment, and not the duty of the
goernment to support the citizen
The latter is the socialist doctrine,
it not in words, at least in spirit
It has deeloped so alarmingly, that
ordinary methods of proiding re
enue are oted totally inadequate,
and newfangled schemes are sug
gested to meet the growing eil
No matter what goldmines in the
shape of new tax projects are opened
up, the tendency herein referred to
will grow in an eerincreasing ratio
so long as it is fostered and en
couraged by legislatie action Ex
pansion will neer stifle it; the
breakingpoint must be faced sooner
or later
THE RILRO CHNGE OF
FRONT
The sudden change in the railroad
situation so far as the towns of Jack
son and Sutter Creek are concerned,
has been the absorbing topic of con
ersation for the past week The
concensus of opinion is that if the
railroad is pushed to its original
destination point near Martell's sta
tion this spring, it will remain there
for some time at least How will
this affect the two towns — Jackson
and Sutter Creek— that lie equi
distant north and south of the pro
posed terminus? The intimation
has been gien out that Jackson can
secure the extension of the road to
any suitable depot site within its
limits by paying tribute to the com
pany for the same The demand of
$20,000 i cash, and land — oer eleen
acres for depot site and the right of
way the entire distance from Jackson
to Oneida, taking a strip of 50 feet
on either side of the track — is equal
to a grant of at least $30,000 This
ultimatum is all the more remark
able when it is considered that from
the outset it has been held out by
the promoters that the people of
mador county would not be asked
to contribute one cent, outside of a
conenient depot site in the towns
Coming on the heels of this declara
tion the demand of a large bonus for
bringing the railroad into town, with
the implied threat therein contained
that if the money was not forth
coming the terminus would be per
manently located oer two miles
away, has naturally kindled a feel
ing of bitterness among the citizens
We know not what" the people of
Sutter Creek think of the proposi
tion, but in Jackson — which repre
sents the major part of the traffic
upon which the railroad must depend
for its financial success — the hos
tility is outspoken  policy of
enforced contribution riles up the
pugnacity of human nature It is
much easier to awaken antagonism
than to appease it afterward It is
therefore regrettable that the rail
road authorities hae taken this step

SOMEWHT RUFFLE
The editor of the" Ledger doe 9 not
seem to like the idea of a newspaper
man asking for a public office, and ex
presses himself on that strain anent
the editor of this paper applying for
the position of clerk of the district
court of appeal The Ledger man con
cludes by saying, "in all serious
ness the goernor might do much
worse than to appoint Mr Wood to
the position for which he is now men
tioned" In this we concur, but there
is only one worse piece of humanity
whom the goernor or anybody else
may appoint to be dog catcher or any
old thing, and that is the editor of the
Ledger Since the Ledger is the self
appointed high priest of mador county
politics, we should hae asked permis
sion of his magnitude, the great dic
tator, before proceeding It is a well
known fact and common talk that who
soeer the Ledger supports for any
office, straightway is he ruined, and
this is said to be the reason why Go
ernor Pardee came near being defeated
in this strongly republican state two
years ago In this case as well as most
always, our Jackson cotcm, in continu
ing a disturbing element, is meddling
with other people's affairs and displays
gross ignorance It would be well "if
our esteemed friend would become ac
quainted with the facts before blowing
off again— mador Record
We are pleased to publish the fore
going, giing it the benefit of the
Ledger's larger circulation Our
cotemporary should be more circum
spect in his criticism, and not ruffle
his feathers in the wrong direction
The editor of the Ledger has said
nothing about the Record man's lat
estborn aspirations for office He
penned not a syllable of the article
referred to, and had no knowledge
of it until after it was in print, be
ing absent from the county at the
time The editor of the Ledger is
not opposed to newspaper men as
piring for public position per se;
but we may as well remark right
here, that the Ledger is emphati
cally opposed to the idea that the
mere possession of a newspaper is in
itself the allimportant recommenda
tion for public position Further
more, we may say that as a rule it
is the featherweights of journalism
whose aspirations hae the chronic
officeward drift The real journalist
has a higher opiniou of his profession
than to degrade it by using his
columns to promote his personal
ambition It may also be remarked
that the flotsam and jetsam of news
paperdom — those who are but the
playthings tossed hither and thither
on the surface of the political whirl
pool — are afflicted with hungering
and thirsting for office, and too
often get there
The flattering opinion of the Record
concerning the Ledger is a matter
of supreme indifference to us But
" we dissent" from the intimation
that in discussing this matter the
Ledger "is meddling with other
people's affairs" When a man puts
himself up for office, whether electie
or appointie, he thereby oluntarily
places himself on the firing line of
criticism, and his fitness or misfit
ness for the position sought become
legitimate subjects of discussion
Moreoer, the " we concur" bit of
selflaudation seems to us in ques
tionable taste, and while fully recog
nizing the genial qualities of the as
pirant for a clerkship of a district
court of the supreme bench, we
also willingly " concur 1 ' that the
"goernor might do much worse
than to appoint Mr Wood," at the
same time we indulge the hope that
after a careful surey of the field of
eligible candidates, and animated by
a desire to promote public interests,'
he may possibly be able to do some
what better

Mr Maco's Outlawed Claim
The lone Echo, in commenting upon
the rejection of Fayette Mace's claim
for $250, alleged alue of grael taken
from his land and hauled onto the pub
lic roads in township two, saysPersonal
s a simple matter of equity if it is
true that the county got the benefit of
$250 worth of grael from Mr Mace's
land and the understanding was that
it was to apply on the judgment against
him, he should be gien such credit,
and if the fact, be shown that such a
contract was uirrM into between the
county's representatie and Mr Mace
before the grael was taken, the super
isors, this paper beliees, will deal
fairly in the matter 
Superisor mick asserts that he
authorized no such an agreement, and
if he belieed such was the agreement
ho would pay it out of his pocket, be
fore Mr Mace should lose it
There is no question that the grael
was taken from Mace's land and spread
oer the roads, whether to the extent
of 1000 yards, which is the amount
claimed, at 25 cents per yard, we do
not know The county receied the
benefit of the material It is an ele
mentary principle that priate prop
erty shall not be taken for public use
without just compensation Whether
the county, through its agents or
officers, entered into an agreement with
Mace to allow a reasonable price for the
grael, as Mr Mace claims, or whether
no express contract was made in regard
thereto, as the county contends, makes
not the slightest difference The tak
ing of the grael was in itself an im
plied contract to pay The only rea
son, we presume, why the board of
superisors did not go into the merits
of the case, was, that they were es
topped by the statute of limitations
Oer one year had elapsed since the
last load of grael had been taken
This was not denied Tho law clearly
enjoins the superisors from consider
ing any claim under such circum
stances By allowing any sum for the
grael, they would hae made them
seles liable to prosecution for paying
an illegal claim There is no question
of equity about it Mr Mace—prob
ably had a good claim in the first place
By his own laxity he has lost what
eer rights he had in the premises
Equity will not come to the aid of one
who sleeps upon his rights It is un
fortunate that Mr Mace should furnish
grael without pay therefor, but he,
and not the board of superisors, is re
sponsible for that outcome

Much complaint has been made of late
on account of the poor quality of light
supplied to Jackson In some business
places the lights hae been so dim that
it has been found necessary to burn
gas as well as the electric light The
trouble is said to be caused by the fact
that the wires are too light to carry
such a current as is necessary to keep
the lights up to standard quality The
business has outgrown the capacity of
tho wires To obiate this heaier
wires are being put up, so that Jackson
will soon be able to hae electric lights

THE RILRO PROPOSITION
Citizens of Jackson o Not Faor Sub
sidizing Railroad
The proposition as presented by the
magnates of the lone and Eastern Rail
road to demand $20,000 i inonoy and
right of way and depot site for each of
the towns of Jackson and Sutter Creek
as the price of building the road to
those towns, as stated by the Ledger
of last week, was strictly correct That
was the shape in which the matter was
first placed before the citizens The
people did not take kindly to the ini
tation Indeed, a hue and cry instant
ly went up against listening to any
such proposal The following day
Saturday, the plan was somewhat
modified It was then intimated that
if Jackson people would take up the
bonds of the company to the tune of
$100,000, at 5 per cent discount on par
alue, the company would agree to
bring the road into town Of course
this was to be in addition to proiding
depot site and right of way from the
Oneida This modification met with
no more faor than the original prop
osition The truth is the road was en
gineered from the start that local
capitalists would not be asked to sub
scribe for stock or bonds; they were
ignored in the matter; there was plenty
of money on the outside to be had, and
the road would be built and equipped
and owned by the promoters and out
siders interested in the scheme This
was perfectly agreeable to the business
community generally It" was an im
material matter how or by whom the
enterprise was carried out; so long as
the road was built to the towns desig
nated in the application for franchise
the people were fully satisfied True,
the surey of the line to Martell's only,
and the contract for building extending
only to that point, was regarded as
misty, but this was explained that it
meant nothing more than that the
road was to be built in sections fter
reaching Martell's, surey and con
struction work would be prosecuted to
the two towns without delay, and on
the same basis as the other portion of
the line had been constructod^nainol ,
without help from the clti/ens Tlie
inestors were after business, and
would be fully satisfied if thoy corralled
all the traffic between lone and the
minine towns; that would sulliciently
repay them for the outlay Such was
the attitude of the promoters from the
staVt It, therefore,, was a serious let
lown when the $20,000 bonus was
sprung The feeling is decidedly hos
tile We hae npt beard one oice
raised in faor of contributing in the
way proposed, The furnishing of a
reasonable depot site— not such anex
tensie tract as proposed, which is
betweon 11 and 12 acres— and the so
curing of the right of way from Oneida,
is not considered unreasonable Be
yond this, howeer, there is little dis
position at present to yield
Contested Homestead
The case of H F Vogt s T
Beauchemin, inoling a contest be
tween the agricultural and mineral
claimants of a tract of land on the
Mokelumne rier, in the icinity of
Electra, came up for hearing befpre
the Sacramento land pffiee last week
Beauchemin proed up pn his homer
stead oer two years ago Vogt at
that time filed a protest, alleging that
the land was mineral In character, and
that it included a portion of two min
ing claims held by him There was
some doubt whether there was any
conflict, in the absence of a definite
surey, and so the papers went pn to
Washington The Washington author
ities held that the fact of conflict must
be first established  surey was
made and it was found, so it is claimed,
that the homestead did actually in
clude the greater p,arfc gf two mining
claims of record Hence the hearing
to determine the mineral or non mineral
character of tlje lapd J W Caldwpi}
represented the contestant, Vogt, who
appeared with seeral other witnesses
Silas Penry was attorney for the home
stead claimant fter hearing a por
tion of the contestant's case, that side
was brought to a halt through inability
to furnish further fees fqr taking testi
mony, and as far as that side was con
cerned the hearing was continued
The homesteader then put in the whole
of his testimony The case is there

contestant is prepared to put in the

Furnishing Official Bonds
County treasurer Gritton put in a
claim before the board of superisors
at the last meeting for $120 for prem
ium for official bonds furnished by one
of the guarantee companies engaged in
that business The claim was rejected
It is said there is a law now on the
statute books making a claim for official
bonds a county charge Under this
law all county officers are enabled to
get their bonds from a responsible com
pany 1 without charge to themseles
It is claimed in behalf of the law, that
it is better for the county to secure
protectie bonds on the outside in this
way, than to adhere to the practice
heretofore followed of each officer
traeling oer the county and getting
property holders of his political or
party friends to the number of a score
or more in some instances to go security
for him If one loss occurs the indi
idual bondsmen stand together and
resist collection through the courts
We hae had instances of this kind in
mador county, and years hae elapsed
before the county got anything One
particular case the claim was whittled
down to about 25 cents on the dollar,
and finally settled on a basis of that
kind These facts are referred to in
proof that the polioy of haing official
bonds furnished by guarantee com
panies is in line with public interests
But why the county treasury should
bear the cost is another question The
claim was repudiated in face of the law;
on what plea we do not know, unless it
be that the law making it a county
charge was passed after the present
county officers took their seats; in
which case it might apply to future
officials, but not to present incumbents,

The Staples' Case
Little can be added to the statement
made in the Ledger last week relatie
to this notorious case Sheriff Norman
has written to deputy Kay, saying that
he would not bo home for ton or twele
days This was last Thursday, so the
time will be up about the last of the
month The sheriff was then in San
iego, attending to some other busi
nessthere while the papers in tho
Staples case were traeling through
the tediously slow process of Mexican
red tape Nothingwas said to account
for the delay, other than the slowness
of the officials of the southern republi
can Business that might easily be
transacted in a few hours, required as
many days to complete The sheriff
would hae to return from San iego
to Ensenada for his prisoners, and as
the steamer plies between those points
eery ten days, in the eent of the
extradition papers not being fixed up
as anticipated, it would probably in
ole another stay of oer a week
Howeer, Sheriff Norman is expected
to be home by the end of the month,
unless something unforeseen happens
We may also say that the sheriff's trip
to Mexico is on state business The
state will bear all the expenses of the
extradition of the two accused persons,
r Staples and Mrs Haxie ll the
negotiations are between the state of
California and the Mexican authorities,
and the sheriff of mador county is the
executie officer representing the state,
and not merely mador county in this

To Test a Tax Title
The case of J Nicholaus s B Nich
ley, which occupied seeral days of last
week in the superior court of this
county, is one of much importance It
inoles the alidity of a tax title from
the state of California under the present
law concerning the sale and disposition
of property sold to the state on account
of delinquent taxes The property
affected is in the icinity of Plymouth
Nichley was the owner In 1897,  the
taxes being unpaid, the property was
sold to" the state, with other delinquent
property of that year fter a lapse
of fie years, as the law proides, the
parcel remaining unredeemed, a deed
was issued to the state for the same
This was a formal and exparto pro
ceeding; no notice being required to be
gien the former owner In 1903 John ,
Nicholaus petitioned to hae the prop
erty adertised for sale at public
auction, and the authorization of the
controller was gien for that purpose
The adertisement was duly published
in the Ledger, and at the sale the
plaintiff became the purchaser, at the
price of all the delinquent taxes for se
eral years, with penalties, costs and in
terest added In all the proceedings
the proisions of the law were, closely
adhered to Nicholaus got his deed
The original owner was not named nor
notified in any way; the law does not
make any proision therefor The
presumption is that the owner of prop
erty must know whether he has paid
taxes regularly or not; if he 'neglects
to pay, he thereby oluntarily takes
all the risks incident to such neglect
fter the plaintiff got possession, Nich
ley, the former owner, set up some
claim To settle the matter definitely,
Nicholaus brought suit to quiet title
It is claimed that the case is of state
wide interest, as upon its determination
rests all property sold by the state
for delinquent taxes C H Crocker is
attorney for plaintiff, and  Caminettl
for defendant The matter was argued
and submitted last Saturday It is
likely that whicheer way the case is
decided, on account of its importance,
it may be appealed to the supreme
court

BUYING RUBIES IN BURM
Grips and Signs Used In Bargaining
For Precious Stones
The peculiar business methods of ori
ental merchants are illustrated by the
manner of buying rubies in Burma,
says the Jewelers' CircularWeekly In
the examination of rubies artificial
light is not used, the merchants! hold
ing that full sunlight alone can bring
out the color and brilliancy of the
gems Sales must therefore take place
between oa m nd 3p m, and the
sky must be clear
The purchaser, placed near a win
dow, has before him a large copper
plate The sellers come to him one by
one, aud each empties upon this plate
his little bag of rubies The purchaser
proceeds to arrange them for alua
tion in a number of small heaps The
first diision is into three grades, ac
cording to size Each of these groups
Is again diided into three piles,ac
cording to color, and each of these
piles is again diided into three groups,
according to shape The bright copper
plate has a curious use The sunlight
reflected from it through, the stone
brings out with true rubies a color ef
fect different from that with red spi
nels and tourmalines, which are thus
easily separated
The buyer and seller then go through
a ery peculiar method of bargaining
by signs, or, rather, grips, in perfect
silence fter agreeing upon the fair
ness of the classification they Join
their right hands, coered with a hand
kerchief or the flap of a garment, and
by grips and pressures mutually un
derstood among all these dealers they
make, modify and accept proposals of
purchase and sale

The Gentle Terms a Playgoer Once
pplied to Forrest
 number of professional men were
exchanging reminiscences of Edwin
Forrest the great tragedian One of
them told the story of Forrest's experi
ence in the west which was not only
of Interest in itself, but also a tribute
to the art of the actor
The play was "Vlrglnlus," and For
rest was at his best In the scene
where lie slays his daughter the audi
ence was almost stricken with awe,
and not a sound was heard until the
scene was concluded, after which the
artist was greeted with oerpowering
applause In the following act Virgin
lus comes on the stage looking worn
and distracted The reaction has set
In, he is frenzied oer the loss of his
daughter, and be walks up and down,
crying outPersonal "Virginia, Virginia! Where
Is my child?"
n old miner, who occupied a front
row in the orchestra and who had been
terribly wrought up by the murder
scene, could stand this no longer and,
arising in his place, shouted out in
loud tones, freighted with intense In
dignationPersonal < ' '
""Why, you old illain, you killed her
in the market house In the last act
You know It well enough You are a
hypocrite as well as a illain"
The laughter and applause that greet
ed this unexpected turn in the per
formance made it necessary to ring
down the curtain— Harper's Weekly

Mrs Colburn remoed her outer gar

In her rocking chair in the front win
dow "I declare, I neer saw such a

Jerkily as she ran her darning ball
down Into the heel of Mr Colburn's
gray stocking
"I can't go oer to Mis' eacon
Graes' of an afternoon or down to
the store in the morning that I don't
either find her there or see her, coming
or going, three times out o' fie!
"She's an awful starer, too," contin
ued Mrs Colburn, pulling at a knot in
her darning cotton till it broke and her
elbow flew back against the sharp edge
of the table "I can't look oer at her
front window but what she turns her
eyes this way inside o' fie minutes
on't sit there looking so numb, Wil

myself? Fetch me the liniment, quick!"

proudly saidPersonal

Sounds Beyond the bility of Our
Vocal Organs
"That man can imitate perfectly the
Jingle of money," said in a tone of eu
logy a young woman  
"Well, what of that?" objected her
companion "That ought not to be
hard to do"
"Try to do it"
The objector, after summoning into
his mind the sound of jingling money,
tried "Rrrtattat," he went "Brbr
brarara, chkchkkchk" Then he
smiled apologetically, for he had failed
Not by the furthest stretch of the im
agination could It be said that he had
uttered a sound that resembled mon
eys jingle in the least degree
"I knew you couldn't do it," said the
young woman "It is amazing how
many simple sounds there are that we
can't imitate, try as we will There is,
for instance, the sound of a person
walking, the sound of a typewriting
machine in operation, the sound of run
ning water," the sound of a breaking
dish Yon can't Imitate those com
monplace noises, and I doubt if any
one in the world can Our ocal ca
pacity seems to us large, but it is real

THE LBTROSS
Wonderful Flights of This Great
Feathered Wanderer
Of all the strange creatures seen by
traelers not the least interesting is
the wandering albatross This great
feathered wanderer, sometimes meas
uring seenteen feet from tip to tip of
his wings, will follow a ship for days
at a tune Some traelers and sailors
declare that they hae seen a particular
bird fly for weeks at a time without
resting The albatross has always
been a bird of mystery, and in ancient
times the people belieed that these
unwearying sea birds were the com
panions of the Greek warrior loinedes,
who were said to hae been changed
Into birds at the death of their chief
Though the superstition about the
killing of an albatross bringing bad
luck Is only a foolish one, it has sered
a useful purpose for many years in pre
enting the slaughter of these beautiful
and gallant birds— the sailors' friends
and the landsmen's wonder Up in
dreary Kamchatka, that outlying part
of Siberia which cuts into the north
Pacific, the naties, neer haing
heard of the superstition about the
albatross, catch him and eat him, but
his flesh makes such poor food that,
after all, the legend may be said to
hold good, for he Is indeed in bad luck
who has to make a meal of it— Ottawa

SOLON OF THENS
His efinition of the Most Perfect
Form of Goernment
"What is the most perfect form of
goernment?" was once propounded
at the court of Perlander, king of Cor
inth, one of the seen wise men of
Greece His six fellows were present,
and of them Bias answered first, gi
ing as his opinion, "Where the laws
hae no superior" Thales of Miletus,
the great astronomer, declared, "Vhere
the people are neither too rich nor too
poor"
In his turn said nacharsis, the
Scythian, "Where irtue is honored
and ice detested" Said Pittacus of
Mitylene, "Where dignities are always
conferred upon the irtuous and neer
upon the base" Said Cleobulus,
"Where the citizens fear blame more
than punishment" Said Chllo, the
Spartan, "Where the laws are more re
garded than the orators"
The last to reply was the youngest
but wisest of them all, Solon of th
ens, who said, "Where an injury done
to the meanest subject is an insult to
the whole community"— London Tele

His Glasses
He was wearing his first pair of
glasses, and at first they afforded great
relief, but at the end of a month there
was a retrogression! Somehow, polish
the lens as he would, the ision ap
peared to be weaker So he went back
to his oculist and said he thought the
glasses "weren't strong enough"
The oculist stepped aside for a min
ute, then handed his customer what
apparently was another pair Trying
them drew forth the exclamationPersonal
"Why, these are much better! I can
see now as well as when I first wore
my glasses"
Then he was Initiated into one of the
little secrets of the trade The oculist
had merely cleansed each lens with a
little soap and water— New York Post

If It's Yonr First Japanese Meal Too
Will ae a Trying Time
If it's your first Japanese dinner
you're haing a dreadfully hard time
In the first place you must sit on the
floor, for they don't hae any chairs in
Japan You kneel down, and then you
turn your toes In till one laps oer the
other, and then you sit back between
your heels t first you are quite
proud to find how well you do it, and
you don't think it's so ery uncomfort
able But pretty soon you get cramp
ed, and your legs ache as if you had a
toothache in them You don't say any
thing, because you think that if the
Japanese can sit this way all day long
you ought to be able to stand it a few
minutes Finally both your feet go to
sleep, and then you can't bear it a
moment longer, and you hae to get
up aud stamp around the room to
drie the prickles out of your feet, and
all the little dancing girls giggle at
you This isn't your only trouble ei
ther ll you hae to eat with is a
pair of chopsticks, and you're in terror
lest you spill something on the dainty
white matting "floor Now the floor of
a Japanese house isn't just the floor;
it's the chairs and sofas and tables
and beds as well t home it would
be mortifying enough to go out to din
ner and spill something on the floor,
but in Japan, where people sit and
sleep on the floor, it seems een worse
So you are unhappy till your little ne
san (who is the waitress and almost
as prettily dressed as the dancing girls,
but not quite) comes laughing to yOur
aid and shows you how to hold your
chopsticks fter that you manage
nicely the rice and the omelet, but the
fish and the chicken you can't contrie
to shred apart without dropping your
chopsticks all the time So between
dances the maiko— the little girls about
twele years old— kneel down beside
you and help you They can't keep
from giggling at your awkwardness,
but you don't mind; you just giggle,
too, and eerybody giggles and has a
loely time— St Nicholas
LOST IN THE IR
Birds at Times Get Confused anil
Lose Their Bearings
Boys are frequently lost in the woods,
and it is a singular fact that birds are
sometimes lost in the air This might
seem strange to almost any one, but
the aerage man is a superficial ob
serer of little things Personal
In the far north, and particularly
along the ocean coasts, birds are fre
quently storm drien and lose their
bearings, so that many of them are lost
at sea They keep floating in the air,
aimlessly striing to lie until exhaus
tion compels them to drop into the an
gry waes, which engulf them
There is a well authenticated case on
record of an ocean liner bringing Into
New York on a winter's day a large
white owl which had dropped to one
of the forward spars in an exhausted
condition more than 800 miles off the
coast of Newfoundland It was near
ly dead from cold and hunger and al
most too weak to eat anything It had
become much emaciated and trembled
in Its distress when it tried to swal
low the first morsel of meat which was
placed within its beak The captain
and sailors were all interested in it,
and under their nourishing care it
slowly recoered and became entirely
well and healthy antl strong It will
ingly remained with the ship after
ward
It was eidently a land bird which
had been blown off from the coast of
Newfoundland by strong west winds,
had become lost, merely drifted be
fore the gales, kept out of the water,
almost stared to death and made ita
last Intelligent effort to reach the ship
and there fell in exhaustion and col
lapse
Old sailors narrate many other In
stances of finding birds that hae been
lost In the air— St Louis Republic

inariably clean There are no paupers
in Japan and therefore ng workhouses

usty work seems to be responsible
for consumption to a marked degree
In 2,161 cases of consumption treated
at the sixty institutions of the Ger
man empire 1,005 patients had been
employed in a dusty enironment The
kind of dust was not stated in 31
cases; In IS2 cases it was metal dust;
In 129, stone, coal or glass dust; in 116,
wood dust; in 111, wool dust, and in
126, arious other kinds of dust
