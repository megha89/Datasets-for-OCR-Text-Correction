True Sory of This Grea
Tragedy
In he fall of 1855 a young Mexican,
no more han I(i years of age, ap
pioached Joe Gilber of ryown and
said "1 am he friend of he mericans
and I hae somehing o ell you of ial
imporance o you and your, counrymen
ll I ask is your sacred promise as a
friend, as 1 know you are, o keep my
secre If my name is known in his
connecion in any manner wih his
maer my life would pay he forfei"
Gilber, who alked he Spanish
language ery well, assured he boy ha
his name should no be used and be
faihfully proeced
Then, "said he boy" prepare o
proec yourself and your people, for I
oerheard some Mexcans alking las
nigh, and omorrow nigh hey inend
o murder and rob he people of his
own"
Wih an assurance o he boy no o
use his name in any manner in diulg
ing of he secre of murdering and sack
ing of he own, which would cerainly
leae much blood in is rail,
wih an adio lef he faihful young
Mexican o go and confer wih his
fellow ownsmen mong he mos
prominen of hem was a man by he
name of Bell — a half blood Cherokee —
who hen was he proprieor of he hoel
now owned and run by Florence Gian
nini Gilber knew Bell o be a fearless
man— a gunfigher as we now denomi
nae hem — ready o face any crisis in
any wa or any manner Bell had more
han once racked Mexican cuhroas
o heir lair and brough hem up o face
he law They were afraid of him
Bell lisened o he recial of Gilber
elling of he conemplaed racking,
murdering and robbing of he people of
ryown The ' keen, piercing hawk
eyes of he Cherokee flashed fire a
Gilber's recial
"Inend o murder and rob he people
of his place, do hey? If hey do
here will be many a dead Mexican o
ell he ale, for I'll crack more han one
Mexican's skull, wih my reoler, and
here is more han one man here besides
me ha will do he same 1 "
s he finished he whirled on his heel,
followed by Gilber The wo sough
hasily he men hey knew could befaih
fully relied on for pluck and deermina
ion, and he own was soon armed o
♦he eeh for he coming comba
 ha ime he  sree leading a
righ angles from he main'sree srech
ing ou oward Jackson, and heading
oward where Plymouh now sands, was
almos solidly blocked wih Mexican
houses mong he mos prominen
herein was a dance house hronged by
Mexican senorias— he ery hell hole
of he place in general I was 8
o'clock and he pale moon in is firs
quarer was dropping solidly behind he
dense fringes of he rees on he hill in
he wes Tweny well armed men had
gahered a he dance house, for i was
here he faihful young Mexican had
old Gilber hey would be firs seen 
few ook a drink a he bar o ward off
suspicion ha heir appearance was any
hing else han social s hey sa
waiing on he long benches on he ou
side wih keen expecancy, shadows
played in effigy before heir bewildered
senses Each shadow seemed o rise in
phanasm in mockery of murder, bu
sill no Mexicans came Suddenly he
claer of horses' hoofs sruck audibly
upon he ear Nearer and clearer came
he read of he horses s he horse
man approached he iingling of he grea
spurs of which all Mexicans ook pride,
old ha he horsemen were only a few
yards away Insinciely each man
drew his hand close o his reoler ha
hung in he holser a his side 
momen more and 18 well armed Mexi
cans, wih heir bread sombreros hiding
heir swarhy faces from he glining
moonligh haled before he door No
a word was spoken by eiher pary, bu
he keen reacherous eyes of he
murderous hrong ook in he siuaion
Insanly almos he leader of he gang
gae he reins on his horse a wich,
sank he rowels of his spurs ino his
flanks and rode off oward he grea
whie Caholic church ha sood on he
hillside a lile eas or souh of his
place, and ' on a direc line of Lower
Rancheria In' 1 unison each horseman
followed his leader—a renegade whie
man by he name of Porer  salwar
negro, black as ebony, rode by his side
The ohers, lowbrowed reacherous
looking Mexicans, characerisic, of he
peonage ype of mendicans ha 'are
so prealen in old Mexico In council
he mericans concluded hey were only
making away in order o aack he
place from a differen sandpoin They
wached he murderous band of horsemen
unil darkness swallowed hem up in is
Inensiy The mericans walked brisk
ly now o he main sree of he own
They had barely arried here when
bang! bang! bang! came he repor of
he reoler
"They are murdering he people of
Rancheria shoued a dozen oices ex
ciedly, "Le us go o heir rescue"
"No," said Bell, "for heir bloody
deed will be oer before we can reach
hem, besides hey migh wheel round If
we kae his place unproeced and
murder our own women and children"
In one sense Bell was righ, for a few
minues only had lef deasaion and
much blood in he lile hamle of
Rancheria
Old man ynan, faher of John ynan
now of madnr Ciy, was sho hrough
he fleshy par of he arm He was a
quickwied man, and seeing he had
bu one chance for his life, fell back
ward behind he warming soe s he
did so he hrew his arm across his
breas The blood spured ou from he
pisol sho and sauraed his eniro
bosom wih blood Porer approached
him, held for an insan  his cocked
pisol uponhis breas, and said, "There
is no use o wase anoher sho on him,
for he is deader han hell" ll his

hrown bodily hrough he window,
breaking he sash and falling in a heap
jus beyond he sill She had no bones
broken, and she is now he wife of
Charlie Enns, now of Fresno, who is
well known o old residens of mador

CENSUS MTTERS
The superior of census of he sixh
disric of California, which Includes
mador couny, is gahering Informa
ion relaie o he couny He says
he las census gae o ownship No 1,
a populaion of 3550, Township 2, 1772,
Township 3, 169, Township , 207,
Township 5, 153, He says in deer
mining upon he number of enumera
ors, s desirable o hae some idea

In a ciy one enumeraor will be able
o ake from wenyfie hundred o
hiryfie hundred names in he monh
o which he aking of he ceusus is

farm saisics are also aken, he enu
meraor prohably will no be able o

In he diision of he couny he has
gien Jackson one enumeraor, and o
he remainder of he ownship one enu
meraor, and o each of he oher own
ships excep Suer Creek, one enumer
aor and o Suer Creek ownship ()
he has gien wo enumeraors Wha
he would paricularly like o know is
where would be a good diiding line
ha would cu Suer Creek ownship
in diisions abou equal as o he
amoun of work required
The diiding line should be so clearly
defined as o aoid so for as possible
he danger of enumeraors renching on
each ohers erriory  couny road, a
creek or rier, a flume or dich line, or
some naural boundary of ha kind is
preferable, alhough of course s no
always pracicable o be obain such
clearly define lines
Census superisors are haing diffi
culy on accoun of he failure of ap
plicaions for posiions as enumeraors
ha is, hose who will do he acual
work of aking he census pplicans
are required o pass an examinaion,
which is no a serious maer, as any
one wih an ordinary common school

few days ago only 25 applicaions had
been filed in his disric, and fully 30

Of Fie Saes
The man who lied o be 8 years old
is ap o hays some unusual adenures
He is sure o If he spends much of his
ime on he ouer edge of hings Such
n man is John  Johnson of Eeres
He whs born a pioneer, haing firs
seen he ligh In Shelby couny, Ken
ucky, February 10, 1825, a a ime
when ha sae was wilder han s o
day, alhough i has neer acquired a re
puaion for meekness and domesriciy
He moed wih; his parens In 1827 o
aies couny, Kenucky, where he
grew o manhood The early moe may
hae made an impression on he child
mind, or springing frUhi pioneer sock
may hae been naural ha he should
go and do likewise when yean urned
loose he wandering foo  any rae,
he sared when nineeen years old, and
didn' sop for good unil he had seen
more of he world han mos men do in
a lifeime; more of he wild places
han one could find in hese days of
spreading ciilizaion Wih he Re
George Pickel, a Bapis miniser, he
wen o Texus in 183 Near allas,
which hen conained bu one house, he
wandering fee arried o ry farming for
wo years Bu before him always lay
he long rail, and in 1815 he followed
i back o he boyhood home in Ken
ucky
I was naural ha Johnson should
feel again he call of adenure when he
Mexican war broke ou, and he did
Bu he faes ha hae carried him far,
played him false on ha occasion The
Mexican war, like he Spanish meri
can war, saw more young men anxious
for serice han he goernmen could
use, and Johnson's company was neer
ordered ou Bu in 18!9 he wandered
again, his ime going o Buchanan
couny, Missouri, which was hen, be
fore he days of Kansas selemen, he
border land He farmed here a year,
bu in ISSO he was on he road again,
following he long rail of gold seekers
o California The company he joined
crossed he rier a he presen sie of
chison Of he wagon rain which he
joined, many of he eams were oxen,
and painfully slow for a man going o
pick up a forune So lohnson, and
seeral of his companions, who had
swifer beass, and were in a hurry,
wen on Seenyrie days ou of chi
son hey reached Placerille,Cal Seen
yfie days, and hey were in a hurry!
Now s a scan hree days' journey on
comforable cars There hae been some
changes in a half cenury
Placerille was hen known as Hang
own, and i didn' ge ha name wih
ou earning i The California which
Johnson knew was he California of
Bree Hare  land of gold camps, and
gamblers, bad men, and igilanes o
make hem be gocd If hey wouldn'
be good, hey were hanged, and here
were oher Hangowns besides Placer
ille For eigh years Mr Johnson
dabbled in mining as i was done in he
early days, wihou becoming a bonanza
king Then he hi he long rail again,
coming home a longer roue han he ook
going ou From San Francisco, he
wen by ship o he Ishmus of Panama,
which he crossed on a rain which re
quired wo engines o lif i oer he
narrow Ishmina diide The ride oer
ha ridge made a lasing impression on
Mr Johnson; so srong an impression
ha oday he is among he doubers as
o he ulimae success or he Panama
canal Hej says he goernmen will
neer ge enough waer in he big dich
o floa a ship
From he Carribean erminal of he
Panama railroad, Johnson ook ship o
Cuba, hen and for years afer a Spanish
colony Bu he arried here only long
enough o cach he nex ship o New
Orleans From New Orleans, he came
up he Mississippi and Missouri riers
o chison, which had been growing
ino somehing of a pioneer ciy in he
meanime Bu, while he came o Kan
sas in ime o be a pioneer, as he had
been in Kenucky, Texas, Missouri and
California, as on he long roue which
joined hem, his sae proed o be
wha he was looking for I has proed
ha for many ohers, as hose who hae
lef only o reurn, can esify, and s
proof of heir wisdom ha hey linger
here, afer wandering far in search of
somehing beer
Perhaps i was he California ex
perience which caused Mr Johnson o be
a leader in a moemen o organize a
igilance commiee, which helped o
promoe order in his hen somewha
disorderly region Oh one occasion in
he early days in Kansas, Mr Johnson
and Na Kimbirlin, his broherinlaw,
had reurned from driing a herd of
hogs o marke, and had considerable
money wih hem They receied a hin
o look ou for robbers ha nigh, and
concealed hemseles in fron of heir
log house, under a work bench They
were armed wih shoguns and reolers
They did no wai long before wo men
came, whose acions were decidedly
suspicious Bu before he bandis had
ime o ener he house, he men in
ambush opened fire wih heir shoguns,
and he robbers ied, leaing a rail of
blood hrough he cornfield ; also leaing
heir has, horses, saddles and bridles
The nex day Johnson and a friend
called on a neighbor near by, and, on
enering he house, found hlood all oer
he floor They hough he robbers of
he nigh before had found refuge here,
bu Hie blood proed o be ha of rabbis
which had been hrown on he l!oor, ond
he robbcis were neer locaed

sep has been aken in he way of re

icularly forunae ha Judge Wood, in
his case should make ha erms of he
probaion so explici, and a ha same
ime so binding ha here is no pre
mium offered for he commission of
crime The young man in his case,
canno consider himself a free man ill
he erm of his probaion expires He
is in he hands of he law as he should
be for his crime B; insead of being
herded wih confirme I criminals here
o complee his educaion, and come ou

foundaion for an hones life When
his erm expires, insead of sepping
forh naked, and poery sricken, ready
for he firs criminal job a hand, wih
which o secure he means of susen

formed, and will be in condiion o con

In answer o your quesion "where
were you and upon wha business during
your absence" my answer isPersonal
I wen o San ngelo, Texas, in he in
ers of he prosecuion in he case of
he sae of Texas s H B Knowles,
charged wih perjury The facs in he
case are as follows  In he year ISM
Knowles sold a aluable jack o one
Vrooman, and soon hereafer Knowles
sole he same jrck from a large pasure
where Vrooman had pu he animal and
run he jaPersonalk off o anoher couny and
sqld i Knowles hen came back o
San ngelo and ook h common burro,
worh $8 or 810, and^ killed or crippled
i, and hen placed i on he railroad
rack Knowles hen informed Vrooman
ha he rain had run oer and killed
he fine jack ha he (Knowles) had sold
him Vrooman sued he railroad, und
on rial Knowles swore ha he jack
ha was on he railroad rack was Vroo
man's—he aluable one ha Knowles
had sold o Vrooman The railroad
deecie aferwords found Vrooman's
jack in Jones couny, where Knowles
had sold i, and Knowles was indiced
for perjury by he grand jury Knowles
gae bonds in he sum of $000, which
he forfeied, and ccme o Wes Poin in
Calaeras couny, Cal where he kep a
saloon for a shor ime He hen wen
o Nashille, in El orado couny, and
engaged in he same business under hs
iiame of J N Padge
On he nigh of Sepember 1, Padge
murdered John Smih, a 17 year old half
breed Indian a Nashille, and escaped
and fled o laska, where he wen under
he name of lanley Las year, Know
les was aken back o Texas from
Seale o answer o he old perjury
change He gae bail again, and again
forfeied i no, appearing for rial a
he May erm of his disric cour, bu
he showed up again in fan ngelo jus
prior o he ecember erm of cour and
demanded a rial
In Texas he indicmen expires in
hree years if he defendan is in he
sae and can be brough o rial
Knowles claimed o hae been in Texas
all ha  me, whereas in ruh and in
fac he was in California, and i was
necessary o proe ha fac, aiid he
winesses from California were aken
here for he purpose of idenifying
defendan Upon seeing him hey
posiiely recognized him as he man
Padge who was here in 189 and 1895,
and as he man who murdered Smih on
he 12h day of Sepember, 1895, a
Nashille
The rial came on, he jury was im
paneled and he prosecuion had ample
esimony o secure a conicion, bu
forunaely for Knowles and unforunae
ly for he sae he defense discoered a
clerical error in he indicmen, and
afer hree days argumen he judge
ruled agains he sae, quashing he
main couns in he indicmen and in
sruced he jury o acqui he defendan
I hereupon wired o he auhoriies of
El orado couny, asking hem if hey
waned he man, bu receied no reply
Since my reurn home I hae been in
formed ha he disric aorney of El
orado couny has he maer under ad
isemen, and will soon deermine
wheher he will exradie Knowles for
he El orado crime
I found while in Texas ha Knowles
has a preious bad record, being charged
wih he murder of an old Mexican
sheepherder in 1890 in Schleicher
couny, Texas, and suspicioned of
arious oher crimes I seems oo bad
ha such , a criminal should go un
punished, and I hope and beliee ha
he will ye be compelled o face rial for
some of his crimes"
