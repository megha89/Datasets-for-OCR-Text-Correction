Why Jackson Should
Hae he High School
(Communicaed)
 an elecion held Noember 7,
1910, he people of mador couny de
cided hey were in faor of a couny
high school, and he momenous ques
ion is, where shall he high school
be locaed
To he people of mador couny we
submi some facs why he ciy of
Jackson should be seleced as he sie
of his school
Jackson is he oldes siser, social
presige is herj Here is locaed he
sea of couny goernmen We are
an incorporaed ciy wih an area of
I,'iJ square miles and a populaion of
3500 Jackson is he mos prosper
ous, permanen and picuresque
mounain own on he "Moher Lode"
Her mines are among he heaies
gold producers in he sae, one of
which, he Kennedy, is he deepes in
he Unied Saes The payroll of
hese mines is $60,000 per monh,
which is a leas $35000 greaer han
any oher own in he couny Jack
son need no depend alone on her
mines bu in he iciniy of Jackson
are copper, marble, granie, sand
sone, imber, fine farms, orchards,
ineyards, and being he couny sea
is enough o insure her o be always
he leading ciy of he couny We
hae good hoels and banking facili
ies lmos eery business and pro
fession is represened, four churches,
weny fraernal socieies, upodae
business houses and residences Her
manufacuring concerns are  machine
shops, prining offices, soda works,
gas and ice plans, macaroni and
candy facories Our public schools
offer unsurpassed educaional facili
ies We are a ciy of homes under
whose parenal roofs are housed 512
school children In adjacen disrics
are 261 school children, making a oal
of 773 school children in he immediae
iciniy, while in our siser own
here are 28 school children and in
disrics coniguous o her are 281
schorH children making a oal o 529
school children Shall he 773 children
be made subserien o he 529 of our
neighboring own?
The axable propery of Jackson is
$1,981 007, while ha of Suer Creek
and mador Ciy is $1,312,021, show
ing ha Jackson is assessed for
$668,986 more han he oher wo
owns combined
Jackson is locaed in he cener of
populaion and wealh of he couny
From Jackson comes he far greaer
number of graduaes who would be
likely o aend he high school
Parons coming o he couny sea o
aend o official business could hae
he pleasure of isiing heir children
who are aending he high school
Now in iew of he facs as gien,
and in order o hae a high school
\ur hy of he name, and one ha will
be a credi o our couny, will you no
agree wih us ha he sea of our
couny goernmen is he proper place
o locae he high school
Mr Voer, le us no lose sigh of
he aim for which we are aspiring
 high school ha will mee he
hopes of he people who are welcom
ing i, and giing i heir suppor
I is only under such faorable con
diions as Jackson ses forh ha a
high school can claim finess for exis

THE LOCL CENSUS
By he reurns of he census jus gien ou California has
gained in ppulaion in greaer raio han any oher sae in
he Union during he pas en years, he increase being oer
6o per cen The figures are ery graifying for he sae as
a whole, bu mos disappoining for he iesidens of he min
ing counies of he moher lode, which secion has he unen
iable disincion of suffering a serious decline in populaion
mador couny has los more heaily, proporionaely han
her siser mining counies By he census of 1900 mador
couny had 11,116 inhabians By he census of 1910 he
populaion is gien as 9086, a loss of 2030 in he en years
This means ha we hae less people by nearly onefifh han
we had en years ago  he same raio, he couny would
become depopulaed in fify years On an aerage we hae
los 203 persons each year during he pas decade  falling
off was expeced, because i was indicaed by a reduced regis
raion of oers and a diminishing school census, j Sill such
an alarming ouflow of populaion as ha reealed by he
census was unlooked for Our neighboring counies are in
he same caegory Calaeras has los 2029 in he same
period, El orado 19, and Tuolumne 110 Neada, he
banner quarz mining couny, has been hn he same way
wih a loss of 283 •
I is remarkable ha while California has been reaping a
seady hares of immigrans a he rae of oer 70,000 per
year, hese foohill regions—unsurpassed in naural weah
and for homemaking purposes — should lag behind so badly
There is a cause for i, probably a combinaion of causes
s far as mador is concerned he anomaly is presened of
a seadily increasing assessmen roll and a subsanial in
crease of gold oupu, keeping sep o he march of depopu
laion In oher words, we hae hried in spie of our loss
—grown richer insead of poorer by he depleion of our
ranks Though comparaiely few in numbers, we are pros
perous
The census reurns show he alue of persisen aderis
ing in aracing populaion Souhern California owes is
wonderful growh o he fac ha i has neer missed an op
poruniy o sound is own praises in he ears of he home
seeker The "knocker" is no much in eidence in he
souh land nd ye hey canno and do no deny ha he
norhern porion of he sae is far ahead of he souh in all
ha appeals o he one seekiug a desirable home place Bu
he booser spiri has had full swing in he counry of lesser
naural adanages, and has made i wha s oday The
aderising business has been a oally negleced science as
far as mador couny is concerned The sranger has been
lef o find us ou in his wanderings, insead of being inied
and guided by an exended hand Being off he usual pah
of rael, he inending seler finds a home elsewhere, ignor
an of eeryhing ha his foohill counry has o offer
The mining indusry has no conrbued o his ouflow
'of populaion We are aking ou as much gold as we eer
did from quarz mining, and he fuure in ha line is ery
brigh Bu our farmers hae declined Many hae sold
ou o sockmen, and housands of acres formerly occupied
by small farmers are now surrendered o sockraising
These foohill lands hae been found peculiarly adaped o
cale, and he sockmen hae seadily increased heir hold
ings a he expense of he acual illers of he soil The
process of cuing up big land holdings o accommodae he
demand for small farms, so prominen a feaure of oher
pars of he sae, has been reersed here; we hae been
breaking up he farms o accommodae he increasiug herds
of he sockmen How o creae a endency he oher way is
he problem ha faces he foohill secions
There are en school disrics wihin a rad'us of
half a dozen miles of he couny sea This erriory conains
abou one half he school census children of he couny, ex
clusie of he exising lone high school disric From he
iewpoin of "he greaer good o he greaer number," i has
far superior claims for high school faciliies han any oher
disric, and equal o all oher disrics combined; I canno

I appears, ha he noisiness of
he  modern highspeed machi
nery may be aoided by he use of
cloh as a maerial for working pars
of he machines In a paper laely
read in New York o he Naional
Machine Tool Builders' ssociaion,
John Riddell menioned experience a
Schenecady wih gears and pinions
made from highgrade muslin, which
had been applied o aried uses, and
had proen no only  almos noiseless
bu ery srong  pinion of muslin
ha had been used wo years on a
boiler maker's punch and shear, boh
reduced he noise and remedied rouble
from he breaking of gears On wo
10foo planing machines, operaed by
elecric moors and compressed air
cluches, muslin inermediae pinions
were applied for ; he reerse moion,
and were found silen and durable in a
place where bronze, rawhide and oher
maerials lased no more han hren
or four weeks, and seel made an in
olerable noise In special ess he
cloh pinions resised wihou injury
shocks so seere as o break nearly
half of he eeh in a guniron pinion
This special dieary was arranged by
he medical officer of he workhouse,a

Wants to Help Someone.
For thirty years J. F. Boyer, of
Fertile, Mo., needed help and couldn't
find it. That's why he wants to help
some one now. Suffering so long him
self he feels for all distress, from
backache, nervousness, loss of appe
tite, lassitude and kidney disorders.
He shows that electric bitters works
wonders , for such troubles. "Five
bottles," he writes, "wholly cured me
and now lam well aM hearty." It's
also positively guaranteed for liver
trouble, dyspepsia, blood disorders,
female complaints and malaria. Try
them. 50c at Spagnoli 's drug store.
