Mow Indian Tribesmen Succeed In
Escaping the Police
Some of the Indian tribes oer which
we rule gie us a great deal of trouble,
notably the Mahsuds The Mahsuds,
howeer, are not by any means the
worst of the Indian robber tribes, the
uneniable distinction probably falling
to the Bhils, who ] are ; the cleerest
scoundrels in; the ; world, 1 both in their
methods of acquiring, other  people's
property and in eading pursuit
• They are ery proud of their skill in
pilfering and openly, boast ofit One
of them once told a British officer that
he could steal the blanket from nnder
him and was ; promptly challenged to
show his ability That night when the
officer was fast asleep the Bhll robber
cut a hole in his tent, crept noiselessly
in and gently tickled the hands and
feet of the sleeping man " The
stirred uneasily and- turned oer' 'ln
this way the Bhil was able to pull the
blanket out a little way By repeating
his performance he finally* succeeded
in "coaxing" the blanket completely
from under the sleeper
When engaged in his nefarious little
games," the Bhil wears hardly * any
clothing, and his lithe body is rubbed
with oil to facilitate escape from any
would be captors When hotly pursued
by the British troops, the robbers make
use of a ery cleer deice They con
ceal their scant clothing under their
small round shields and scatter them
about to resemble stones or bowlders;
then, picking up a few twigs— if there
are any to be had— they • assume j all
sorts of grotesque attitudes, their al
most fleshless limbs silhouetted against
the dark night sky closely resembling
the charred limbs of a tree Absolute
ly motionless, they hold their positions
till the enemy has passed them
In this way a British subaltern in
charge of a party sent to capture some
Bhils was considerably startled one
eening The pursuit had completely
lost sight of the robbers, and finally
the party drew rein by a clump of
gnarled and bent tree trunks, tired and
hot from their hard exertions The of
ficer in charge took off his hat and
placed it on the end of a broken limb,
when instantly there was a wild scream
of laughter, and the tree trunks sud
denly came to life and anished in the
darkness— London Express

"For contempt, your honor," was the

MAKING BONELESS HAMS
Housekeepers Mar I>o It as 'Well as m
Professional Batcher
Little though one may think, the
process of making a boneless bam is
quite a fine art and one that require*
no small degree of skill in tbe under
taking In fact,  it Is not eery one
who can "bone" a ham successfully
In the eent a housekeeper unfamiliar
with the art ' of remoing the bone
from hams were to undertake the job
she would be almost certain to begin
operations by first of all splitting the
bam open and endeaoring to care out
the bone by cutting around It The re
sult would be failure and exation of
the worst sort, to say nothing of a ruin
ed ham The proper way to remoe
the bone would neer suggest Itself to
the aerage housekeeper '
The operator stands the ham on end
gainst a supporting block' and pro
ceeds to care around the Personal bone from
one end as deep as It Is possible for
him to run his hand and knife down
into the flesh and around the bone
Haing reached tbe extreme limit (as
far, in fact, as it is possible to extend
the knife), he reerses the ham and
begins cutting around | the bone from
the other end, cutting downward until
he reaches the point that be attained
in cutting from the end on which he
began, the entire operation being sci
entifically correct and on the principle
of skinning an animal Tbe bone then
slips out clear and smooth, free from
any adhering flesh
As soon as this is done stout twine is
wrapped around the ham and drawn
taut, completely closing the aperture
left by the remoal of the bone The
twine is thus made fast and the ham
laid away for a day or two, at the end
of which time the, hole has closed so
neatly that In slicing the ham, it is
difficult to determine the exact spot
from which the bone was remoed
This is the proper mode of making
boneless  ham, and with a little prac
tice any housekeeper can learn to do
the work as well as a professional
butcher They will obsere that first
of all the bone is surrounded by a tis
sue, and by starting the operation from
the ends they will be surprised with
what facility this tissue, diiding the
bone from the flesh, peels loose from
the former
A CURE AN A FEE
Peculiar Experience of a octor
With a Bnalneaa Man
In conersation one day about the
peculiar iews that commercial men
sometimes entertain about professional
serices r S Weir Mitchell told tno
following storyPersonal *
"A ery wealthy man from the west
came to consult me about an attack of
ertigo lie said that he had Just re
turned from a trip to Europe, where
he had consulted eminent specialists,,
but that they had failed to"affor4 him
any permanent relief 'A physician in
London,' be said, 'asked me why I did
not make an attempt to be cured near
er home I thought on my way out
west 1 would stop oer to see you'
" 'Has any physician you hae isit
ed looked into your ears?' I asked
" 'No,' was his reply
"I made an examination, of his ears,
remoed some wax and a substance
that appeared to be hardened remnants
of cotton wool I sent him away then
and told him to come again in a day
or two He did so
" 'Well,' he exclaimed, 'I am cured
How much do I owe you?
 " 'About $50,' I replied
"As he drew a check 1 he asked, 'id
you know when you first examined my
cars that you could cure me?'
"When I told him that I had a ery
fair coniction that I could, he saidPersonal
'Well, you are a blanked fool You
should hae said to mePersonal "I think 1 can
cure you, and I will do so for $10,000'
No cure, no pay" You would hae
got your money without a murmur'
- "'Oh,' I said, 'if you feel that way
about it there are seeral little chari
ties in which I am interested, and'—
" 'No, no,' he interrupted, that Is not
business I hae my cure, and you
hae the price you asked The trans
action is closed'"' • 
Braas In England ln Chaucer's Time
A metal resembling brass, but said
to hae been superior in quality,  was
known in England as "rnaslin" as early
as the time of Chaucer, and in the
reign of Henry VTIL an act of parlia
ment was passed prohibiting  th» ex
port of brass out of England Whether
the earlier monumental brasses still to
be found in our churches were made
originally in England Is not absolutely
certain, the probability, according to
some antiquaries, being that they were
of French or Belgian workmanship—

ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FAC
TORS IN CHIL BEARING •
Reaaona Why Food Should Not Be
Tumbled Rapidly Into the Little
Stomach— Adice Which Apnllea to
Grown Folka ai Well ait Uu'uea
 In the proper bringing up of a child
there is nothing absolutely more im
portant than this one thing— to teacPersonal
It to eat slowly • , ; ' • 
Eery groom knows and obseres the
rule in tho care of a uorse that rapid
eating is futal to digestion There are
all sorts of pateut mangers to preent
the horse swallowing his oats too
quickly The man who bus no patent
manser knows enough, whenneces
sary, to put a stone in the manger,
scattering the oats around it, so Unit
the horse may be compelled to eat
slowly  If the horse's inclination is
to gulp down water too fast, the care
ful man will put a big sponge in the
water, compelling slow drinking
A child's appetite, when he is al
lowed to eat rapidly, is always in ex
cess of his actual needs unless the
child is In bad health The reason for
this is extremely simple The child
craes food because his body requires
to manufacture new tissue He is
growing, and he must not only replace
the used np tissues that his daily life
destroys, but he must make new flesh,
new muscles, new bone and new blood
eery day, adding weight and size
The sensation of hunger is not the
craing of an empty stomach, satisfied
as soon as the stomach is filled; it is a
craing that Is felt by the neres all
oer the body This craing cannot
possibly be saUsfied until the stomach
has begun the work of transforming
the food into blood, flesh, muscles, etc;
consequently the sensation which we
call hunger persists long after the
child or grown person has rapidly ab
sorbed as much food as it really needs
A million foolish parents urge their
children to eat a great deal and always
let them eat as much as they want to
Yet all of these know that a famished
man taken off a wreck will eat himself
to death if allowed to do so The ery
hungry child goes to the same excess,
only in a lesser degree The great
safeguard against that excess in eat
ing, which kills 00 per cent of men be
fore their time and which accounts for
09 per cent of children's diseases, is
slow eating
Nearly Personal all children eat too rapidly
They do so by nature Slow eating is
a matter of education But too often
the mother or the nurse teaches the
child the habit of eating fast When
the baby is little, it is fed one spoonful
at a time Before it has time to half
chew or een gulp down the first tea
spoonful of food another is held to its
lips Of course it swallows what it
has 'in its mouth and seizes upon the
next mouthful The habit thus incul
cated by foolish adults often ruins the
child permanently
Four factors count in the healthy as
similation of food, factors which par
ents and nurses should remember As
suming the food to be properly prepar
ed, thoroughly cooked and wisely se
lected, there comes, first, the work of
the teeth, which prepare the food for
easy digestion; second, the- action of
the salia, with which the food must
be thoroughly mixed in order to mini
mize the necessary work of the gastric
juices In tho stomach; third, the work
of the stomach itself; fourth, and most
important, a proper supply of blood
and of heat
Force your child to chew slowly and
thoroughly eery  mouthful If noth
ing else will do, compel him at fre
quent interals to lay down his knife
and fork that the Importance of pro
longed chewing may be impressed upon
him on't allow your child to gulp
down water or any other liquid with
his solid food If you allow him to
drink while he eats, the saliary
glands will not act They will not
need to act, for he will be able to swal
low his food easily when it is made
moist by water
You can't do anything to help along
the unconscious process which goes
on in the stomach, but you can do e
erything to help that process by at
tending to the fourth necessity, which
demands blood and the heat of the
blood in the stomach Allow no child
After eating to take iolent exercise,
to study or een to read an exciting
book The brain has first call upon
the serice of the heart, and as soon
as the brain is excited the blood leaes
the stomach and goes to the head The
muscles also when too iolenUy ex
erted draw the blood away from the
stomach
It is absolutely impossible for a child
or a grown person to digest properly
or to get strength and itality from
what he eats unless for at least a half
hour after eating the stomach be al
lowed to monopolize the blood supply
Children should be kept quiet in
Borne way, especially ery young chil
dren, after they hae eaten In the
case of ery young babies nature at
tends to this mercifully by making
them go to sleep as soon as they hae
absorbed their milk Older children
ought not to go to sleep directly after
eating for physiological reasons which
may be explained at some other time;
but they ought to be quiet and calm
Tens of thousands of children in homes
where this newspaper is read are ruin
ed in health by studying right after
meals The public school system
which gies children too short a rest
ing period in the middle of the day is
responsible partly for this, and the
home studies at night are also respon
sible
Eery word that Is said here applies
to grownup people, of whom not one
in a hundred has eer been taught to
apply to himself such common sense
care as is bestowed on a second class
horse— New York Journal

CURIOSITIES OF MICA
Its Appearance Before It Is  SplM
Into Sheets
The mica as it comes from the mluei
is In blocks which , are theoretically
short rhombic prisms, but practically
are scarcely recognizable as sach, ha
ing a ery rough and uneen contour
They 'hae  ery perfect cleaage
pnrallel to the base and may be splU
into laiulum thinner than the thinnest
tissue paper, and these lamina? form
the • familiar transparent stoe panes
end lump chimneys The exterior por
tions of these blocks are opaque, brittle
and worthless, presumably from the
penetration of water, for mica soon
decomposes when exposed to any con
siderable  weathering A thick tayet
of plntes lias therefore to be remoed
from cither face of the blocks lwfore
any mica of commercial size or alue
is reached, and the sheets split from
the remainder are surrounded by a
wide margin of worthless material •
But the difficulties and losses of
mica j mining are far from being - all
fcinirnerutod- Een when occurring in
blocks of , commercial size it is ren
dered "alueless, or comparatiely so,
by one or more of a series of defects,
which may be classed as color, specks,
ruling, ribbing and wedge formation
It sometimes occurs literally pied with
black dots, consisting in' general of
bluek oxide of iron or garnet, and
when een a few of these are present
its commercial alue is destroyed, be
cause such mica when used as an Insu
lator Is peculiarly liable to puncture,
the specks forming practically short
circuits for the electric current The
"same is true of streaks, which are
sometimes turned to red rust 
Some otherwise excellent mica is
found to be ruled or cut as it were,
with a series of perfectly strnißht
lines, parallel to one side of the crys
tal, so that on being split the mica
falls immediately into strips; or again,
instead of being striped or ruled, tin
mica is often deeply ribbed or corri
gated parallel to the adjacent edges of
the crystal, so as to gie the appear
ance of the -letter A, or,' rather V
whence it Is termed "A mica" As the
ribbed portion has to be cut away in
the sheet, such mica is unprofitable
unless the blocks be large Wedge
mica is that in which the block is
thicker nt one end^ than the other, the
lamime partaking in the uneeiiness
Such blocks are wholly worthless ex

HER FACE HER FORTUNE
Why One Ctrl Got • Good Paying
and Kmy Position
She was a sweet looking girl, with as
fair a pink and white complexion as
woman eer desired, and was chatting
with one of her own sex on a Staten
Island ferryboat, while I was seated
so near that I could not help hearing
Seeral times my truant eyes deserted
my paper and stole a glance at the
face that was so attractie
"It was the luckiest thing that eer
happened to me," she said to her com
panion, Personal "when I went Into that Fifth
aenue store Just to buy a comb How
little I thought that I would be work-
Ing there at greater wages than I had
eer hoped to earn! I, hesitated about
going In, because I feared the prices
would be too high, but I did go in and
came out with a comb without paying
a cent for it And, better than all, I
had been engaged to begin the next
Monday as a saleswoman
"I was nearly discouraged before
that, for I was getting only $4 a week,
and we were awfully pinched at borne,
but my luck changed on that day, and
it was Friday too Fortunately for me,
the store was crowded when I went in,
and the proprietor left his desk that
stands in a little railed off corner and
came to wait on me I noticed that he
looked ery sharply at me, but not at
all in an Impudent manner
• "'Pardon me, miss,* he said, Trot' I
am looking for a young lady to assist
me in the store here, and if your cir
cumstances are such that you would
care for the place I would like to hae
you consider It'
"I was wonderfully surprised, but
thanked him, saying that I knew noth
ing about the business
" That doesn't matter,' he replied
'You can soon learn it To be, frank, I
would like to hae you on account of
your complexion Sou know we sell
all sorts of goods for the complexion
and articles for beautifying, and your
face would do more to make sales than
all of the arguments and representa
tions that could be made'
"Well, the result was that I got a
fine place, with easy work, at $15 a
week My hours are short, and I sim
ply, play the agreeable while selling
goods at an immense profit I wouldn't
let any of the concoctions touch my
face for anything, but the customers
appear  to be impressed by my com
plexion, and the proprietor Is satisfied

Ground or crushed bone is | a good
form in which to gie lime ,
The nests should be arranged so that

Bran is a better feed for fowls than

An excellent feed for young chicks is
cracked or coarsely ground wheat for

A cock that fights and picks, his

Cane or sorghum seed can be fed to

lates egg production and in many waya
is good to use for ariety •
For a good breeder select a rooster
with plump, full breast, broad across
the back, wide between the legs and
that crows often, loud and long
It is a good plan to mate up the
fowls early, for occasionally one of the
hens will want to sit during the win
ter, and it will be best to hae the eggs

RIICULOUSLY EXAGGERATE
Story of Sickness, eath and Famine in
the Garaenta Family
An article appeared in the San Fran
cisco Examiner of the 13th inst giing
a harrowing story of -the lamentable
condition of the Garaenta family of 
Middle Bar, during the early part of
their siege of diphtheria— a story of
isolation, sickness, famine ,and death
The fact •of the matter is, the whole
thing was exaggerated to the extent of
being little less than a pure fabrication,
a fact substantiated by the nurse, Mr
Clark, who called on us this week It
is true eery member of the family was
stricken with the dreaded malady, but
as in all instances of the first appear
ance of an epidemic in a sparsely set
tled locality, the people were taken
unawares and unprepared to contend
with it In the first appearance of the
malady in that family, they were prob
ably Ignorant of its true nature until
they were all stricken down, for, as we
all know, that fatal disease traels
rapidly among the members of the
household into which it once enters
When the cases were diagnosed by the
attending physicians, then the trouble
to find nurses arose,* for it is not eery
person who feels that he can afford to
expose himself, howeer willing and
solicitous he may be The result was
that the situation was distressing for a
time, as relaties and friends, on ac
count of their families, did not dare to
go and lend a helping hand A first
class nurse was finally found in' the
person of Mr Clark, and now all the '
remaining members of the family hae
recoered I They were attended by
two physicians from Jackson, who used
the anti-toxine remedy in combatting
the disease Tho tale of destitution,
want of food, etc, is the worst kind of
rot , The family is in comfortable cir
cumstances, but what its members did
want was that timely help which no
amount of money could hae secured
under the circumstances
We clip the aboe from the Cala
eras Chronicle The article referred
to was a ipecial dispatch sent from
Stockton It not only exaggerated the
facts as our cotemporary says, but also
incorrectly gae tho residence of the
Garaenta family as Amador county,
whereas they lie on the Calaeras side
of the rier— Ed]'

ANOTHER STRIKE IN SAN FRAN
CISCO
San Francisco seems to be, en
titled to preeminence as the storm
center of strikes It is rarely free
from the throes of one of these mill
stones upon the industrial progress
of any community Why tbe
metropolis of California should gain
this uneniable distinction is diffi
cult to understand That the fre
quency of these labor troubles has
retarted the growth of the city few
will deny For many years capital
ists hae been timid about inesting
in enterprises because of this tend
ency of the labor element to reolt
Within the last few years eery de
partment of labor has organized a
union, and these unions — trusting
in the might of numbers perhaps
more than anything else — seek to
control the situation, and dictate
terms to the employers Naturally,
when such an attitude is assumed,
the other side to the controersy
becomes unyielding, and a struggle
of endurance is the result These
contests for supremacy are inari
ably inaugurated with the cry that
only peaceful means will be resorted
to in the effort to secure the desired
end Usually, howeer, the paths
of peace are not ery productie of
results In a test of endurance be
tween the pockets of the workmen
and the financial strength of their
employers, the adantage is with
the latter The numerical superi
ority of the workers, and their or
ganization for mutual protection,
do not altogether offset this adan
tage The employers hae also the
priilege of combining for their own
protection, and een things up in
that respect The toilers exhort
their cohorts to stand shoulder to
shoulder in unbroken array, and the
employers do likewise The solidity
of the one is the excuse for the
solidity of the other The rights or
wrongs inoled are too often lost
sight of in the bitterness of the
strife, and the contest generally
ends with each party ( figuring up the
losses instead of gains Strikes,
after all are but relics of barbarism
They are the dernier resort in the
settlement of labor disputes When
all other means hae failed — too
often before any other means hae
been tried — the strike is ordered in
the spirit of a challenge to battle
This method of settlement occupies
exactly the same place in the labor
world as war among the nations,
inasmuch as it means the dictation
of terms by the ictor, by the prac
tical exhaustion of the weaker and
losing side
T^ie strike of the street car em
ployes in San Francisco is the latest
exhibition of this belligerent spirit
The new owners of the Market street
system of street railways were
hardly placed in possession when
they are faced with the wholesale
desertion of their employes The
business of the city is again demora
lized And the striking employes
congratulate themseles that public
opinion is in their faor, eidently
basing this judgment upon the atti
tude of the press and the fact that
the mayor was elected by the otes
of unionists and their sympathizers
San Francisco is to be pitied in this
new misfortune
A SUSPICIOUS MOVEMENT
A desperate effort is being made
to prejudice thepublic mind against
the proposed constitutional amend
ment No 28 This amendment is of
a radical and sweeping character
It proposes to abolish the railroad,
bank, insurance and other commis
sions now existing, and consolidate
the same in the hands of one com
mission, to be known as the state
commission This is to be com
posed of fie persons, whose salary
shull be $6000 per annum each This
commission is to* hae charge of
transportation, gas, electric light,
water, power, telephone, telegraph,
and express companies, also banks
and insurance corporations, with
absolute power to fix rates for the
same A strong objection to the
amendment is that it gies to the
commission the power of appointing
as many clerks and employes as they
may see fit, and the salaries for
these, as well as their traeling ex
penses, are made a state charge
Circulars hae been sent broadcast
oer the state giing reasons why
the amendment should be defeated
These circulars were distributed
free at the republican conention at
San Jose last week The document
is stated to be issued by the joint
committee of the San Francisco
board of superisors and league of
California municipalities It is con
tended that it will work an injury to
counties and incorporated cities by
taking away the power they now
hae of regulating water and gas
rates and street railroad fares, and
also diert the reenue cities and
counties now derie from licensing
these corporations into the state
treasury, as the state commission is
authorized to fix a license for all
such corporations, the money to be
paid into the state treasury, and
the aggregate reenue from" this
source must not be less than the total
cost of the salaries of commissioners,
appointees, and all expenses author
ized by this amendment No doubt
much may be fairly urged against
the proposed change in the consti
tution On the other, a good deal
might be said 1 in faor of its adop
tion It is admitted that the com
missions now in existence, and
which the proposed commission is to
displace, are a failure They accom
plish nothing They draw their
salary with neer failing regu
larity, and that is  about the only
practical result achieed It may
be that the new commission would
proe just as unsatisfactory We are
not prepared to say that the amend
ment is as pernicious as these
municipal commentators wish to
make out It is quite possible that
much of this agitation to defeat it
comes from interested sources Of
course, those filling the fat berths
on the present commissions are not
pleased at the prospect of being
legislated out of office by the direct
ote of the people They will  use
all the influence at their command
to defeat the amendment The loss
of reenue to the counties and cities
will also tend to weaken the propo
sition, notwithstanding that this
loss will probably be more than off
set by the gaiu to the state treas
ury All things considered, we
think this sweeping amendment
stands a more than een chance of
going down to defeat, but still, in
spite of the determined opposition,
we cannot get rid of the opinion that
in its spirit and intent, it is a step
in the direction of a much • needed
reform

TARIFF TINKERING
The promoters of tariff concessions
to Cuba are haing a hard time in
getting their measures adopted by
congress The reduction is faored
by the administration and many of
the republican leaders, not because
it is sound republican doctrine, but
because, as they claim, it will placa
Cuba on her feet financially With"
the help of reciprocity she can build
up her shattered industries; with
out it she will be ruined utterly
Haing done so much for Cuba, in
liberating her from the yoke of
Spain, we are in duty bound to do
more "We hae liberated her from
bondage, we must make her rich
Such is the line of argument adopted
But many republicans cannot see it
in that light They iew it as a de
parture from the fundamental re
publican policy of protection to
home industry emocrats approe
it, because it is in the direction of
breaking down the barriers of pro
tection It accords with their free
trade principles  The cry that we
are a world power, and • must reach
out after foreign trade is mislead
ing The home trade is of infinitely
greater importance than foreign
trade Less than two per cent of
our manufactured goods are sold
abroad Our prosperity conjes
from the policy of making the arti
cles we need at home and thereby
keeping our labor employed and the
money in our own country Any
extra foreign trade we might get by
departing from this policy is not
worth striing for Republicans
generally are not in faor of this
Cuban scheme of reciprocity, be
lieing that it will be harmful to the
United States and beneficial only to
a few Americans who hae inested
in sugar plantations in Cuba, and
work the sympathy-for-Cuba dodge
to conceal their moties of self
interest

A PEACEFULf STRIKE
Tlio press and ninety-nine " per
cent of the public ; may -sympathize
with the " striking car men in San
Francisco, but that does not proe
that justice and right are all on
their side Sympathy sometimes,
and for obious reasons, graitates
to the side haing the strongest
battalions The force of numbers is
the only argument in sight 10 their
pererted ision The faqt stands
out as clear as noonday that the
powers that be in San Francisco are
doing all they can to win the strike
for the strikers, and at the same
time are practically claiming to bo
strictly neutral and impartial  It
is a peaceful struggle they say, and
yet the strikers are allowed to board
the cars in oerwhelming forco for
the purpose of persuading, in their
own peculiar way, the new employes
to quit their posts Cars are stoned
and windows smashed, but this is
done by sympathizers,  and not by
the men on strike, and therefore
police  protection  is denied -/It
makes a great difference we pre
sume to the railroad company
whether their property is destroyed
by the strikers or their aiders and
abettors If an accident should oc-
cur because of the iolation of the
company's rule prohibiting coner
sation by passengers with the con
ductor or motorman, the, company
would be held responsible And yet
the authorities of San Francisco are
winking at this ery thing* The
strikers hae no more right to enter
a street car on its beat, in order to
tamper with the employes, than
they hae to enter the power 4 house
of the company for the same purpose
The mere payment of the fare en
titles them to a passage, but no
more And yet the presentation of
fie cents is made the cloak for try
ing to stop the company from tran
sacting its business; and the strikers
are congratulated by an admiring
press and public on the peaceful
conduct of their fight The curse of
San Francisco is that it seems to be
permeated by an unhealthy senti
ment on such questions Much is
said about the compulsory arbitra
tion of strikes But we beliee the
only feasible way of s^ettl in g labor
troubles is by the passage of a law
making it a crime for anyone to at
tempt to interfere either by force or
moral suasion with an employe dur
ing working hours who has taken
the place of a man on strike After
working hours they are at liberty to
(?o their best to Win him oer to
their side by peaceful methods, but
during the hours of employment the
law should adequately protect him
from molestation in any manner
This is just to the employer, and no
one can truthfully say it would work
injustice to tbe dissatisfied striker

NOTICE-^
When you are about to buy a suijt
of clothes, it would be absurd to go
to a carpenter's shop When in
need of medicine, you would not call
on the blacksmith to prescribe for
you To reasonable people it will
appear that to buy a suit there is
but one place, and that is the tailor
shop, where your suit caa be fitted
on you before being made up; and
where' yeu' can select your g6ods,
nottfrom a piece of scrap "ou paper,
where in ulne'cases out of ten when
your suit' arries it isn't at all what
you selected If you buy it home
you can select your goods from a
large assortment of piece goods, and
can see what you are gettiugfor
your money Your ready made
suits are pressed and remodeled with
no extra charge; this I guarantee
Remember mine is tbe only place in
Jackson where you can hae this
done free of charge
Hae just receied a brand new
line of spring and summer goods all
ready made aud to be made up to
order • Men's, Youth's aud child-
ren's clothing of the latest styles
Trusting to receie a call from
you, and thanking you for your past
faors, and soliciting the same in
the future,

Mining Journal
aid Fisher was in San Francisco
last week Ho succeeded in organizing
a company to take hold of tho Edin
burgh claim in Clinton district, which
he has been working on for some time,
and which shows ery flattering pros
pect The company has been incor
porated, and sufficient stock placed to
insure the further deelopment of the
property He says there is an 8 foot
ein of pay rock, which has been fol
lowed for a considerable distance
Jas H Turner, who lost a foot by
an accident in the Kennedy some years
ago, went to San Francisco two weeks
ago, for the purpose of haing an
artificial foot fitted to his leg He re
turned Thursday of last week, with a
cork pedal, which has materially aided
him in getting around Indeed the
fact that he is possessed of a false foot
can scarcely be detected from his
moements, so neatly and cleerly Is
the imitation done

J B Meek, in prospecting on one of

at first he had struck a piece of ground
that had been left untouched by the
early miners, but in this he was mis
taken, as close to the bedrock he came
across a piece of a prospector's horn
and other indications that the ground
had been worked for gold He is of
the opinion, howeer, that an un
worked grael seam exists on one of
the acant lots near by, and has se
cured permission from the owner to
prospect thereon

THE AMAOR LEGERPersonal JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIAY, APRIL 25, 1902,
FIRE AT IONE
Piccardo's Barn - estroyed and 4 Horses
Burned to eath— Origin of Fire Un
known
A destructie fire broke out at lone
at 3 o'clock Wednesday morning, re
sulting In the destruction of the large
barn occupied by A Piccardo's freight
teams, and all its contents The barn
was 3ituated near the end of the rail
road track The building was rented
by A Piccardo, and used for stabling
his animals" oernight The night
before the fire there were 26 animals
kept there But the eening in ques
tion the small freight wagon was at
lone, employing only four animals —
three horses and a mule The wagon
was loaded up with freight, and left
outside the barn, ready for starting on
the up trip early the next morning
The teamster, whose name Is Hizer,
did not sleep on the premises, but at
the Commercial hotel, fully half a mile
away At three o'clock the fire was
discoered by ' neighbors It had ac
quired such a headway that nothing
could be done in tho way of saing
property ' inside The four animals
were burned to death in their stalls,
their remains lying in a
ghastly row when the flames had spent
their fury A large quantity of hay,
amounting to seeral, tons, and also all
the harness, was destroyed -The load
ed wagon outside was badly scorched,
but the efforts of those who rushed to
the scene were, successful in saing it,
and also its contents - Piccardo's loss
will foot up fully $600, without any in
surance The animals were insured,
but only as occupants of the home barn,
so it is probable that nothing can be
recoered by reason of 'their loss in the
lone barn
Personal Treading so closely on the heels of
the late robbery of Piccardo's saloon,
many are disposed^ to -think that the
fire was the work of an incendiary,
and has some connection with that
crime There is nothing but surmise,
howeer, to bear out this theory, and
it is probably entertained for want of a
more plausible explanation
A Piccardo was notified of the loss
early Wednesday morning by tele
phone and started at once for lone to
look into the matter
Mr Piccardo returned Wednesday
eening He thinks the fire may hae
started from- spontaneous combustion
of the hay Those who noticed the
fire first say it started in that part of
the barn where the hay was stored
There was a water trough outside, and
the leakage from this probably soaked
through into the hay, and the damp
ness would in tbe course of time gener
ate heat ' A tramp might hae got
into where the horses were kept; but
the hay compartment was locked The
barn was owned by the Kirk brothers,
and was uninsured The damage to
the freight in the wagon is estimated
at not to exceed $20 The damaged
freight arried in Jackson Wednesday
night  
A Xiner Badly Injured
An Italian miner named aid Fran
zoia, while working in the slopes of the
Oneida mine last Monday, Was caught
In a cae, and sustained ery serious
injuries He was working with an
other miner, but his companion re
marked that the roof of the stope was
loose and got out of the way  Fran
zoia, howeer, started to use the pick,
when a great mass of it fell " He was
carried by the debris about 10 feet, and
struck by the rock in seeral places
His left leg was broken at the thigh,
and his right arm fractured in two
places His right hand was badly
crushed r Gall attended the un
fortunate man, and in addition to set
ting the broken limbs, remoed a por

Fatally Burned
An Italian named Michel Fassatte
was fatally burned in his cabin near
Slabtown on the night of April 14
His partner who occupied the cabin
with him was away at the time When
he returned on the night In question,
he found Fassatte seerely burned
about the head and back, and suffering
great pain It is supposed that he was
under the influence of drink; that by
means oi a lighted candle carelessly
handled the bed clothing was ignited,
and the ictim receied his injuries
before he was aware of the fire He
was brought to the county hospital
early on the morning of the 15th, but
in spite of all that could be done for
him,  he died from the effect of the
burns on the 21st instant He has
been a resident of this section for many
years, and was commonly known as
 ' 'Garabaldi ' ' He seems to ha ye had
no relaties in the county
The Ficcardo Bobbery
Nothing new has transpired in rela
tion to the robbery of Piccardo's saloon
two weeks ago Notwithstanding the
preailing belief that the perpetrator
of that crime was seerely wounded,
not a trace of the desperado has been
discoered, beyond the finding of tbe
bloody garments at the Bellwether
mine, as narrated in these columns last
week

Reopening of the Original
Amador Mine
Bright Prospects for the Mitchell and
efender— The Sargent Mine to be
Started Immediately
Reward— Some work is being done
on this property near Pino Groe J
A Brown is sureying for an upraise
from tbe 200 foot leel to the surface
Mitchell— The work of enlarging
the Mitchell mill near Pine Groe, has
commenced A ton ftamp mill was
recently purchased in Placer county
This material has been receied at
lone, and the work of hauling it to the
mine is now in progress Tho first
load was receied on the ground on
Thursday of last week With these
additional ten stamps the capacity of
the mill will be more than doubled, as
the new stamps are heaier than the
old ones, haing a crushing capacity' of
3} tons per stamp o\'ery 24 hours The
old mill is also being put in thorough
repair Considerable work is also be
ing done on the hoisting works A
new gallows frame is being erected; in
fact, the entire works are undergoing
a complete oerhauling The mine is
1 not operating at present, owing to the
progress of these improements It
wiil tako from six weeks to two months
to get the new works in running order
The mine is looking well, and the
underground deelopments are such as
to warrant the careful and efficient
superintendent, L C Hyner, in pro
iding this larger and ! better equip
ment The success of the Mitchell
ought to encourage the deelopment of
other claims on the same belt
efender— This mine in Pioneer
district continues to turn out the
bullion with gratifying liberality Last
Monday a shipment 'of gold, the out
put of 20 days run of the fourstamp
mill, was made The product was a
bar weighing about 18 pounds, and
alued at something oer $2000 The
mill will crush about 8 tons per day,
and on this basis tbe yield was at the
rate of $12 per ton The richest ore,
howeer, is sent below for treatment
Some of it will run oer $100 per ton
The mine is opened to the depth of 300
feet They are now stoping from the
200 foot leel, with plenty of rock in
sight There is a 7 foot oin, and the
prospects of the mine were neer
brighter It is reported that negotia
tions are in progress for the sale of the
property for $100,000 The district is
rich in mineral, and the success of the
efender will undoubtedly encourage
the further exploration of that" region
Work on the Sargent mine adjoining
the Hardenburg, near Middle Bar, and
which has recently been incorporated,
will be started at once W R
Thomas, superintendent of the Cen
tral Eureka, who was instrumental in
organizing the company, has notified
interested parties that a surey of tbe
property will be commenced to-morrow
Bunker Hill— Leels at the 800
and 1400 are being drien north and
south A leel is also, being run from
the 200 to connect with the Mayflower
tunnel, so that the water will only
need to be pumped to this point instead
of to the collar of the shaft In the
800 north leel a small ein of good ore
was encountered on the hanging wall
this week It has the indications of
widening out into a big lodge The
1400 leels are In low grade ore, but the
quality of same is gradually growing
better as the drifts extend from the
shaft
The el Monte mine in Calaeras
county is now connected by telephone
with the office in Jackson'
Negotiations are in progress looking
to tho starting up of the Original Ama
dor mine at Amador City This mine
has been shut down for eighteen years
It was explored to a depth of 1400 feet
The surface shows that the country is
much broken up at that point The
range of hills on which the Keystone
and Sauth Spring Hill mines are lo
cated, is broken on the Original Ama
dor ground, and a raine formed,
through which Amador creek passes
As might be expected this broken -up
condition preails beneath the surface
Bunches of good ore were found, but
no well defined ledge was discoered
It is belieed by many, howeer, that
at greater depth the true fissure will
assert itself Eastern parties hae
taken hold of the property, and are
prepared to spend considerable money
in its explorationPersonal 
Capitalists from San Francisco are
expected in Jackson dally, to inspect

Shall We Celebrate
The matter of celebrating the coming
Fourth of July in Jackson is becoming
a topic of conersation among the
business people We see no reason
why the county seat should not hae a
celebration this year, notwithstanding
the fact that the big attraction of last
year was held here It is getting to bo
more and more the custom for each
township to do something in the way
of celebrating independence day It is
no longer the case, as was the practice
of years ago, that one big festial will
satisfy the demands of the entire coun
ty A celebration een at a central
point in the county, will be attended
only slimly by residents outside of the
immediate icinity of the town This
has been the experience of successie
years, and is the foundation of the de
sire in each center of population to
celebrate the national birthday in its
own way At last year's celebration
the sum of oer $500 was raised by pub
lic subscription, which was augmented
by receipts from ball and other sources
to oer $750 Out of this there is a
balance to the credit of the fund of $42,
which is aailable for the coming
fourth if it is decided to ' celebrate in
Jackson Last year's affair was fairly
satisfactory, and an equally creditable
showing can be made with considerably
less money, as there is now only one
local band, whereas two had to be em
ployed a year ago It remains for the
business men to decide what shall bfj
done In the premises, and the sooner
an agreement is reached the better will
it be for all csngerned

KILLE BY AN EXPLOSION
Two Miners Blown to Pieces While
rilling in the Lincoln Mine
A terrible accident occurred at the
Lincoln mine, Sutter Creek, last night,
causing the instant death of two men,
Jack Nelson and Sol Wedge These
men were engaged in running a Bur
leigh drill in the sinking operations in
the shaft at* the depth of 1800 feet
Two other men-wore employed in run
ning another drill on the opposite side
of the shaft, the skip standing at the
bottom, separating the two crews It
Is customary to drill ten or a dozen
holes, each four feet deep,' in arious
directions, before charging and ex
ploding them It is impossible to tell
whether all the charges hae exploded,
and in this fact lies the danger of drill
ing operations In running tho holes,
the minors aboe named must hae
drilled into an unexploded hole As
soon as the drill struck the charge of
powder, it exploded, and the workers
were literally blown to pieces The
other two men, whose names we hae
not been able to ascertain, owing to the
shelter afforded by the skip standing
between them and the place of ex
plosion, escaped without injury The
debris struck against the skip and left
them untouched They consider them
seles remarkably fortunate in escaping
with a 'big scare and a few scratches
The men who thus so suddenly were
called by death, were both single men
Nelson was about 35 years of age, and
came from Winnemucca, Neada, al
though he had been working in Sutter
Creek seeral years Wedge was about
22 years old, and a natie of Sutter
Creek His father was killed a year
or so ago at one of tho mines in Sutter
Creek by a timber rolling on him
He Kept His Leg
Twele years ago J W Sullian, of
Hartford Conn, scratched his leg with
a rusty wire Inflammation and blood
poisoning set in For two years he
suffered intensely Then the best doc
tors urged amputation, "but,") he
writes, "Iused one bottle of Eletrlc
Bitters and 1} boxes of Bucklen's Arni
ca Sale and my leg was sound and
well as eer" For Eruptions, Eczema,

ISTILLE WATER
It Is the Purest, Beat and Only Ab-
solutely Safe Water
Boil a gallon of water until there is
but a quart left, and the quart will
contain all the impurities  of the gal
lon and be nearly four times as im
pure as before  Continue the boiling,
and all the impurities— animal, ege
table and mineral, except the gases
thrown off— will be reduced to one sol
id mass The water which is eapo
rated and passed off as steam is ery
nearly pure But, you will say, it kills
the dangerous germs We will sup
pose it does, but their remains furnish
material for bacterial life to feed up
on o you relish the idea of eating
in food or drinking their dead and de
composing bodies, which poison the
water by their decomposition? The
fact is scientific inestigation has pro-
Pd that boiling only kills the feeblest,
the least injurious, germs
Try a simple experiment Put un
boiled city Aater in one bottle and the
same that has been boiled for half an
hour or more in another, cork tightly
and keep in the sun or in a warm place
for a week or longer and note the dif
ference The unboiled water will show
a marked depreciation in looks, taste
and smell, but that which has been
boiled will be so much worse in these
respects that no one would think of
using it In comparison with these
you can submit a properly sealed bot
tle of pure 'distilled water to the same
conditions, and at the end of a year it
will be found to be as pure, sweet and
perfect as ,when first bottled ;
 The purest< and best and the only ab
solutely safe water to use for drink
ing and the (preparation of all foods
and artificial} drinks is that produced
by distillation, but the most imperfect
one produces a water far superior in
purity and 'healthf ulness to the ery
best  spring waters under their most
faorable conditions The nearest ap

THE JAPAN CURRENT
Knro Slwo Piles Great Loads of
riftwood on Alanka'a Shores
In one sense the Kuro Siwo, or Japan
current is the most interesting In the
world because many oceanographers
beliee it was the direct means of peo
pling America This much at least Is
certainPersonal If a boat were to be set adrift
on parts of the Asiatic coast and sur
ied all storms, the Japan current
could be depended upon to carry it
across the Pacific and deposit it on the
American shore Such a thing has
happened In 1832 nine Japanese fish
ermen were left dereUct and unable to
find their way back to shore They
went with the current and after a
drift lasting, during seeral months
they were carried to Hawaii
Trees torn by storms from the banks
of Asiatic riers frequently float across
the Pacific to the American coast Be
tween Kakatag and Kyak islands,
about 1,200 miles northwest of Seattle,
enormous piles of , this driftwood coer
the \h -iii-hcn, There can be no question
of the Asiatic origin of the timber
They are the trunks of the camphor
tpte, the mango and the mahogany
Logs 160 feet long and eight feet In di
ameter are frequently found Many of
them are seen floating shoreward, with
fantastic roots standing high aboe the
waes In places the logs are piled
twenty feet high They are generally
without bark, which has been peeled
off by the waes, and most of them
hae become white and heay from
impregnation with salt water As they
pile up the sands drift oer them, and
gradually they sink out of sight and
new beaches are formed This process
has been going on for ages, and the
shore line Is being steadily extended
Excaations along the beach show that
texture of the burled timber gets hard

The Willing; Worker
"Why is it," asked a modest' young
breadwinner, "that when I stay at the
office after hours to oluntarily ' do au

more to do? 
 "That has happened to me time after

any one of my subordinate who sits
down and does work which Isn't specif

he does do and let it go at that with

by giing him something further to do
"Of course it's an old saying that the

MEMORY OES NOT FAIL
It Simply Gtli Weak and Langrnl*
Por Want of VHe
Memory does not "fall" (except In
lora of all the faculties); It simply gets
-iuk and languid for want to use Just
as tlie phsical organs do People of
ten say, "My memory Is falling," when
It is really as good as eer If they
would gie it a chance
A word,' a date, a name, an incident,
comes up, or rather falls to come up
iuen yon want It There seems to be
no possible way of remembering It
You make two or three efforts, gie up
and any, "There's no use; lt'fl gone
from me"
 Nonsense! It hasn*t It Is there Just
as much as it eer was only there are
a lot of things oor It Keep at work,
bring your will to bear upon it, try and
try and try, and after awhile you can
pet it
And, better, you will find that the ex
ercise required in remembering It will
help you next time, and that a little
toil and determination put together
will accomplish wonders in the whole
range of the faculties
Look oer your memory, see where
you are moet deficient and exercise it
in that respect You can do it at any
odd time; while you are walking, rid
ing, resting after a day's work, listen
ing perforce to a dull speaker on't

A Little Too Sure
A well known Philadelphian is noted
for his inability to remember j faces
He has passed by his best friends on
the street as though he neer before

er forgetting a face She prides her
self on this "gift" and she declares
that the faces of eery man, woman
and child whom she has eer met is
photographed on her memory- The ab
sentminded man • had passed her by
seeral times, looking blankly at her
At last she saidPersonal 
"I wager a box of the best cigars
you eer smoked that I will recall my
self to your recollection the next time I
meet you" ' V
The man in return wagered a box of
gloes One day the woman, going
along Walnut street felt sure she saw

showed no sign of recognition, j The

"the biggest nigger in the business,"
supported the entire weight of an Im
mense packing case, weighing upward
of 1,800, on his prostrate body The
negro held the hand truck to receie
the case, which in the hands of half a
dozen men was being balanced at just
the right angle to slip Into place But
it hit the edge of the truck and knock
ed It away, and the negro unluckily
lost his footing and fell fiat with the
great box on top of him He shrieked
in terror and groaned, It was Bald, like
a siren whistle, but < when a gang of,
fifteen men lifted the thing bodily and
pulled him out all he did was to screw
his fists into his eyes like a big child,
stretch his long limbs grotesquely and

discoering "the cheerful theater goer"
But in they poured, men and women,

traeled on crowded cars and the
