JPNESE QUESTION TO THE FOEE
I is safe o say ha he posiion
aken by Presiden Rooseel on be
Japanese quesion in his message, will
sir he people of be Pacific slope
saes as hey hae no been sirred
since be ciil war The same argu
mens were urged in behalf o be ad
mission of Chinese c ail be priileges
aocoided oher races some weny U
years ago ha are now brough forh
in behalf of he Japanese I required
many years o oduoae he easern
and middle wesern saes o he ex
clusion of Mongolians The same
ligh is now on wih regard o he
Japanese Le i be admied hai
he Japanese are he mos enlighened
and progressie of Oiienal naions,
ihey are alian in war, and equally
successful in be ars of peace They
hae fairly earned he righ o be
classed wib he mos culured and
progressie nf naions ll his is
no seriously dispued Bu ha does
no reach be core of he quesion
There is a deeprooed prejudice in
be minds of merican ciizens o
any influx o siaics o hese shores
This feeling is no a mere senimenal
une o he dwellers of be Pacilic
coas I is based on experience
We hae boen brough in 'conac
wih be Mongolians, and we do no
wan hem as fellow ciizens, or com
panious i any way Oher secions
of he Union haing no experience
in his direcion, hae no his pre
judice, and would force an undesii
able populaion upon us If hey
undersood he maer as we under
sand i, hey would feel exacly as
we do, and wan o shu hem ou
precisely as we do If he condiions
were reersed, and Japan were
hreaened wih an inasion of
Causasiajas o such an exen as o
disurb be labor marke and he
educaional sysem of ha naion,
would here no be some seps aken
in ha counry o ward off he
danger Of course here is no danger
from his sourse The higher paid
laborers are no going o immigrae
in any formidable numbers o a
counry were a farlower wage
schedule exiss
Tha he lile brown men and beir
children are accorded free educaion
in separae schools should be suffi
cien This ough no o wound he
sensibiliies of be Japanese Tbe
same discriminaion is lesored o
oward be colored race in he souh
ern saes They are no permied
o ride in he same car wih whie
folks in some saes Why, insis
ha be people of California shall
assooiae wib Japanese as wih heir
own race The ruh is hey will no
do so, no maer wha he reay
obligaions demand, or he inerpre
aion placed herein by he presiden
or by congress Japanese ways are
no our ways They are of differen
menal, moral and physical makeup
We canno assimilae wib hem, aud
would no if we could Neiher can
her assimilae wih merican ways
The rade we hae wib Japan is no
worhy of menion as an offse o be
admission of Japanese as ciizens, or
on erms uf social equaliy Far
beer ha we sell no a dollar's worh
of goods o hese island people han

o Japanese ciizenship or admission

We hae oo mucb mixure of races
