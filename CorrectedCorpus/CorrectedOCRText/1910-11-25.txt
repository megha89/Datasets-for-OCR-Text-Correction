The illage of Pine Groe was he
scene of a ragedy las Saurday
afernoon ha has no been known in

acor in he affray was an unknown
rump Where he came from, and
wiher bound no one seems o know
He was seen in Jackson he preious

I is said he appeared a one of he

The sranger uered no a word He
walked oward he bar, and Berry,
hinking he was abou o call for
somehing, sepped behind he bar
prepared o sere him ler reach
ing half across he room, he urned
and reraced his seps o he main
door He glanced boh ways on he
road, apparenly o see if any one was
near Then urning oward he bar,
he whipped ou his pisol and sared

He was in he ac of urning, wnen

in he roadway, cluching his reoler
Upon examinaion i was found ha

The pisol was a new 32 caliber re

he San Francisco Examiner, in which
Johnson was criicised; all papers

Lowry was earned from he road
enderly by his friends ino his home,
and Berry called up sheriff Gregory by
phone elling him of he killing The
sheriff inquired, "Where is he man
you killed?" Berry replied, "He is
lying ou here in he road"
Sheriff Gregory and disric aorney

MENING OUR CRIMINL LWS
I is noorious ha he sysem of criminal procedure in
his counry is he mos cumbersome, expensie, and a he
same ime ineffecie, among ciilized naions The case of
r Crippen in London has brough ino srong relief he de
fecs of our mehods of dealing wih criminals Here was a
man ried, coniced and execued for a capial crime in he
shor space of wo or hree mouhs — less ime han i fre
quenly akes o ge a noable murder case fairly before a
jury in his counry Ouside of he Unied Saes he ma
chinery of law for he punishmen of crime moes swify on
ward o is goal — he punishmen or acquial of he accused
I makes lile difference wheher he defendan be possessed
of wealh o fee highpriced lawyers or no — he progress of
he case hrough he cours is lile affeced hereby Wih
all our auned claims o maerial progress, i mus be ad
mied ha in dealing wih crime and criminals we migh
paern wih adanage afer he ways of he older counries
in many respecs
In iew of our admiedly defecie sysem, he sae legis
laure ha will assemble in Sacrameno nex January is
pledged o reform One of he ial changes proposed is o
allow he rial judge o insruc he jury as o he facs as
deeloped by he esimony as well as he law bearing upon
he case This has loug been he pracice in European
counries I has been found o work so saisfacorily ha'
no idea of change would be faored The summing up of he
judge is usually he crucial poin of he rial; he eidence
is sifed by a rained and imparial mind, and he jury is old
wha o beliee and wha o discard The charge amouns o
a recommendaion ou he par of he judge wheher a erdic
of guil or innocence should be reurned I is rare indeed
ha a erdic is found conrary o he judge's recommenda
ion, and sill rarer ha a failure o reach a erdic occurs,
which is so ofen he oucome of criminal rials in his coun
ry How i came o pass ha in our cours he rial judge
i his insrucions o he jury became limied o quesions of
law only, and any expression of his iews concerning he
facs would be deemed prejudicial error, and sufficien ground
for a new rial, we do no know Experience has demon
sraed ha his deparure has no been conducie o he "sup
pression of crime or he punishmen of wrongdoers
Bu anoher reform proposed is permiing hreefourhs
of he jury o bring in a erdic in criminal as well as ciil
cases Wheher his is necessary, wih he enlarged powers
gien o he judge in insrucing he jury may be doubed
nyway, here is reason o beliee ha some of he crying
eils of our criminals rials will ere long be remedied, so ha
he main objec o be aained in he prosecuion of crime —
he proecion of sociey — will be kep more in he fore
ground han under he presen sysem
The complee reurns of he oe on $18,000,000 bonding
proposiion for sae highways hae no been made public as
ye I is probable ha he proposiion has carried If so,
we are inclined o hink he people hae oed hemseles a
big whie elephan We hae lile faih in he sae engag
ing in he consrucion and mainenance of roads nd o
embark in his business by piling up a huge deb seems
folly indeed I is no probable ha mador couny will
share in he roadniaking under his bond issue We will be
lucky if couned ouside of he field of operaions of he model
roads o e buil by his fund, because he condiion a
ached o he expendiure hereof is ha each couny is
required o mee he aunual ineres paymen on he bonds
for such proporion of he money as is expended wihin he
couny  an esimaed cos of $10,000 per mile, he bur
den is no iniing o counies siuaed like^ mador Bu
we shall hae o pay our share of he fund for he redemp
ion of he bonds This will srike us in he shape of a
special sae ax leied annually for ha purpose

he may turn me into a messenger of
death to uphold the law that man holds
as his perogative. " As I looked at
the man and conversed freely with
him, a reflective thought passed like
a flash through my mind— these men
are employed by the commonwealth
of the state, to guard the prisoners.
Suppose a man makes a leap for
liberty, it is natural, bang! goes the
Winchester, and down he goes; this
is law, this is order. He kills the
man because of duty. Now, my
reading friends, there is cause for
the condition that makes so many con
victs. They are not criminals by
nature, but by circumstances. Senator
Perkins said in a lecture twenty years
ago. "Hunger, squalor, and want,
know no law. The world's greatest
philanthopista and the political econo
mist are striving to bring about a
betterment of economic conditions in
order to aid the mass of human slaves
that are really slaves to their own
wants.
After 1 had been there for a half
hour the guard was relieved. He took
the seat, the other took the gun in his
hand and placed it against the wall
to suit him. He was altogether a
different sort of a man from the other,
florid in complexion, lymphatic in
tempermanent. There was a deter
mined look in his eye that gave you
the impression that he was tnere for
what was in it. He gave you to under
stand that he was there to shoot at a
man with the same deliberation that
he would shoot at a target. Another
man in livery came out and engaged
in conversation. He appeared from
both action and word to be more of
a humanitarian than the other. He
said, "Many ii man In those prison*
walls ought not to be there. One man
in particular is in there for 20 years.
He was a married man, and an agent
for pianos. A woman's treachery to
get one of those pianos for nothing
placed him behind the prison bars. It
was the work of an adventuress, using
her 14 year old girl as the bait to en
trap him. This I had straight from
the sheriff of the county that brought
him here. It was a deliberate conni
vance on the part of the mother to
force the agent to give her the piano.
Then her scheme failed, she turned to
revenge, and landed the man in ■ the
penitentiary by a triumped up charge
of the woman. "He is a smart fel
low," he continued, "he has con
structed the model of a marine engine
that experts say, is the best In ex
istence. Well it is a shame for
there is genius j housed in both peni
tentiaries that would surprise you. A
man in San Quentin has invented a
machine to detect fraudulent bank
bills. It is infallible, and certain to
be used by all the. banks., .
The conversation then turned upon
the markmanship of guards. "When
I was at San Quentin five years ago,"
said the guard at the gate, "there
was a demand for guards— men who
were expert shots. The test to get a
position was to be made at a target.
It was to hinge principally upon mark
manship.Two darkeys came up and at
tempted to shoot. One was driving
the center out of the target in a way
tnat made the rest of us look wild,
but the tallymen were doing their
duty, they were marking him out
every time. Finally the darkey caught
on, he pulled "out $300 in $20 pieces
and threw them on the ground with a
vim, at the same time saying,
"I'll jist bet yous gemmens dat 15
twenty dollar pieces dat I kin beat
any man shootin in de two prisons."
'/Did you pick it up said the other?"
"Not by a d— 'd sight, for we knew
he could do it, but we didn't want a
d— nigger round us. ' ' Such then is
only race prejudice for the darkey was
really master.

found dead in the vicinity of the court

the city. The yelping dogs started
their music about 12 o'clock, and con
tinued several hours.
It is a pity that the inhuman son of
sin who commits these rash acts can
not be detected and supplied with a

Ellis-Whitaker Nuptials
1 The Ledger was in i error last . week
when it stated that Miss Martha Ellis
of Stony Creek and Low G. Whitaker
of Oakland were united in marriage by
the Hon. Judge Fred V. Wood.

Father Greely in St. Patrick's church.
Miss Hattie Miller acted in the capa
city of bridesmaid, while John Ellis, a
brother of the bride was best man.
The bride is the only daughter of Mr

her chosen path. The groom is the
eldest son of Mr and Mrs J. Whitaker,
and in a native of lone.
After the ceremony, the party re
turned to the ' Ellis home, where a
sumptuous and elaborate wedding
dinner awaited them. Many beautiful
and useful gifts were presented to the
newly weds. Mr and Mrs Whitaker

Not Sorry For Blunder
"If my friends hadn't blundered in
thinking I was doomed victim of con*
sumption, I might not be tiHve now,"
writes D. T. Sanderson, of Harrods
burg, Ky., "but for years they saw
every attempt to cure a lung-raking
cough fail. At last I tried Dr. King's
New Discovery. The effect was
wonderful, it soon stopped the cough
and I an now in better health than I
have been for years. This wonderful
life-saver is an unrivaled' remedy for
coughs, colds, lagrippe, asthma, croup,
hemorrhages, whooping cough or weak
lungs. 60c, $100. Trial bottle free.

Taken Suddenly 111.
The sudden illness ot his father, Dr.
D. S. Mason of Suisun, . caused Har
vey Mason of this city to make a
hurried trip to the home of his parents
last week. Dr. Mason was stricken
oh the street, and was taken to his
home in an express wagon, which
happened by. A communication was
sent to his sons, David and . Harvey
Mason, who are proprietors of the
National hotel, and in response to the
message, Harvey hastened . to his
father's bedside. The aged man is
reported to be but of danger, 'and Har
vey returned to Jackson this week.
Croup is most prevalent during the
dry cold weather of the early winter
months. Parents of young children
should be prepared for it. All that is
needed is a' bottle of Chamberlain's
cough remedy. Many mothers are
never without it in their homes and it
has never disappointed them. \ Sold by

An Amadoran
Receives Compliment
IWe have received a copy of the
Boosters Edition of the Byron Times.
It comprises 100 pages,. with numerous
cuts illustrative of the resources of tho
San Joaquin valley. It is certainly
the most creditable special edition
issued from a ~ paper published at a
small way station like Byron, and
would do credit to a city paper.
Among the personal notices, George
"SalzKcber, formerly of Amador county,
is favored with a biographical sketch,
and a portrait. He is now filling a
position of responsibility with the
Pacific Gas and Electric Corporation,
having charge of the power lines from
Herdly to Altamont. He has been
working for the company for a number
of years, and has steadily worked up to
his present position of trust. We are
pleased to note this advancement by a
former Amador resident.
The old, old story, told times with
out number, and repeated over and
over again for the last 36 years, but it
is always a welcome story to those in
search of health— There is nothing in
the world that cures coughs and colds
as quickly as .Chamberlain's cough
remedy. Sold by all dealers. ;
