he 'sake oi comparison, we herewih presen he ax leies

From his i will be seen ha propery holders are called

he oal assessmen roll a $5,500,000 in round numbers,

of a boos in a direcion ha will be anyhing bu pleasing o

= The changes in he ley for local funds areas followsas
compared wih las yearPersonal Curren expense fund is reduced
 cens; he hospial fund is raised 5 cens; bridge fund in
creased 3 cens; and a new ley of one cen is made for he
(suppor of ouside pupils aending he union high school a
lone, in accordance wih a law passed by he las legislaure,
 which shifs he expense of high school educaion for pupils
aending such schools from poins ouside he boundaries of
he high school disricfs from he parens o he couny
reasury
This ax was beyond he conrol of he superisors o
aoid or abae, and i will coninue eery year unil he law
is changed,or unil a couny highjschool is esablished, which
could doubless be suppored for abou he same expense as
is now incurred for mainaining he union disric high
school
The mos noiceable fac of he aboe figures is he in
crease of he amoun of money required for road purposes
While he road fund remains he same as las year, 33 cens,
he bridge fnnd — which means legally and pracically he
same hing — is increased hree cens — from 12 o 15 cens
These are he funds which are under he exclusie conrol
of he superisors in heir respecie disrics I will be
urged in exenuaion of he exra amoun demanded his
year for couny purposes, ha special demands hae arisen,
such as hospial repairs, and for bridges This is really no
excuse whaeer, and if he people of mador couny hae
o wai unil such socalled exra demands cease o exis,
hey will look in ain for relief These are no exra charges
a all; hey are merely ordinary expenses in meeing he
regular cos of mainaining he couny goernmen Such
exras will crop up perennially in one shape or anoher
eery year This year hey come as hospial repairs, or ad
diional bridge repairs; nex year hey may assume a some
wha differen face, bu he resul o axpayers will be idenical
— namely, more money for carrying on he goernmen
I is abou ime he people of his couny began o ake ac

of any high school in he couny, boh by sae and couny

Take Life Like a Man.
It Is a pitiable thing to see a young
man whining over his lot in life and
excusing indifference and Inaction be
cnuse of hard lncl; or some cruel fate
which has put stumbling blocks in his

No matter what your environment

whining. Turn your face to the sun,
your back to tbe shadows, and look
the world in the face without wincing.
Make the most of your situation. See
the beauties in it and not the ugly
features. This Is the way to Improve
an unfortunate environment.— Success
