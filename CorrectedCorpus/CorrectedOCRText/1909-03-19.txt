S iews he scheme as a sep in he righ direcion, bu s
ery doubful if a sufficien number of oers can be induc

he bonds, he acual paymen of he principal aud ineres
will be allocd o he counies hrough which hese roads
run, pro raa, according o he amoun expended in each
couny This looks o be a shrewd plan o capure he
faorable oe of he populous ciies Naurally in hese
ciies, where model roads already exis, in comparison wih
which he oulying counies, wih all he as sum of
eigheen millions scaered oer he enire sae, could no
hope o compee, nohing of his bond fund would be spen
They Hae money enough o consruc and ake care of heir

Bu heir oe will be he deciding facor in he bond elecion
If beer roads are o be consruced hroughou he sale,
naurally he big ciies will be beuified by he beer rael
ing faciliies hereby afforded nd if cos of consrucion
and paymen of ineres is borne by inerior counies, and no
porion hereof upon he big ciies, why he reasonable con
clusion is ha he oe of such ciies will be hrown almos
solidly in faor of he bonds Such an immense deb would
enail no burden of axaion upon hem On he oher hand,
if he burden of repaymen were hrown also upon hem, ac
cording o assessmen alue of propery, hey would hae o
pungle up he bulk of he money for principal and ineres,
and hence would bury he proposiion under an aalanche of
aderse oes Herein lies he 'danger of his measure as we
look a i The' inerior is o mulced in a heay indebed
ness for bouleards for he residens of San Francisco and
oher populous ceners If we hae correcly gauged he
disribuion of he bonded indebedness, we beliee as he
elecion ime comes on his scheme will rouse he oers
hroughou he sae o a poin pro and con ha has rarely
been equaled in he hisory of Californa
Goernor Gille has eoed he bill inended o repeal he
law requiring he counies o pay he sum of $132 per
annum for he suppor of eery boy or girl sen from heir
respecie counies o he lone or Whiier reform schools
There is oo much of his spiri o palm off he financial
burden of such maers upon he sae reasury, hereby re
lieing hose who ough and are able o bear he cos s
he law has been for years, while he couny from which an
unruly boy or girl is sen o he reform school pays he aboe
cos of mainenance, he paren or guardian of he child is
required o pay he couny if financially able o do so This
proision has a wholesome effec in curbing he endency of
foising upon he public he cos of hese wayward boys and
girls, and of keeping he populaion of hese reformaories
wihin reasonable bounds I is an enirely misaken noion
ha by puing he cos upon he sae hc arious counies
are hereby relieed of any financial burden The resul is
pracically he same, wheher he suppor of reformaories
comes from he sae reasury solely, or wheher a par is
hrown upon he couny reasuries, wih his significan
difference, ha when he sae alone is chargeable, he num
ber of commimens o hese insiuions is ap o increase a
an alarming rae, under he false noion ha i makes no
difference o he counies wheher he commimens be large
or small
To pu he local license on he op noch for repressie
purposes is a harmful policy for any own or couny 
reasonable license for ransien business enerprises, ha
come here perhaps once a year, is necessary for regulaion
and reenue Bu here is no reason in rying o hold hem
up for all he raffic will bear Someimes he paries ineres
ed conclude ha s more han heir business can sand,
and gie he own he goby This was illusraed his week
Posers were pu up around he ciy announcing ha he
dams circus would show here Tuesday afernoon and een
ing I is no doub a small affair, and would no proe much
of a drawing card like he Norris circus and oher large con
cerns Bu when he adance agen discoered ha he
license fees were $25 per day, and $5 exra for eery side
show where au addiional admission price is charged he was
dubious abou he oucome, and concluded o repor o he
managers before paying he ax Ths license ax is no
graded  small show in he naure of a circus is placed in
he same caegory as a big menagerie, and he same sum de
manded for he priliege of showing  circus of any kind
helps business, and heir coming should be encouraged
raher han oherwise for ha reason I is a misaken idea
ha because such shows ofen gaher in n good hares of
coiu from he people of a ciy or couny, ha herefore hey
should be discouraged by a exorbian license

per minute, more than 814,000 per
hour and prer 8300,000 per day. In
lUO7 the product was moro than 51.10,-
000,000,» or more than 811,000,000,
worth of the yellow motal every
month.
In all history there tins beon no
suob golden flood as that which, la
now pouring forth from the Trans
vaal. The mines of indni, of Croe
sus and of Solomon were as nothing
beside it. Tbo treasures of Mexico
and Peril in the times of Cortnz and
LMzarro dwindle in comparison, and
Australia, Alaska and California have
faad^notblng' like unto. this. The
mines ofthu.Hand are now produo
uig more than one-fourth of all the
new gold in 'the world. They were
discovered only a little more than
twenty' 1 - yearj9' 'ago, and they have
already turned out more than 81,000,-
OUO.OOO .w'orlb\\ot hulliou. This is
equal to one-twelfth of all the gold
from the mines, of all the world since
Colnn>bus,\dißoovered America, in
weight it i&Vjust about 2.000 tons, or
go much that if you loaded it on two
borse wagons at a ton to the wagon it
would take a line of teams twelve or
fifteen milea long to carry it all.
More than tbis.these mines promise
to cbntinue pouring out gold for
generations to come. Tbey could pro
duce twice as much today if tbey had
the labor, and tbey could treble that
amount and keep tbe mines going for
years. The gold reeds, in which the
precious metal lies, have been proved
for a length of more tban sixty miles,
and experts say that they can lie
worked to a depth of (3.000 feet. 11
they were worked to 4,000, the
amount ec far taken out would be just
about :i per pent of the whole, and at
that rate there are from 10,000,000,000
to .15,000,000,000 of the preoious
bullion left. '
'lhe production has been increasing
by leaps and bounda ever since gold
was discovered here. In 1884 tbe out
nut was about 850,000, and ten years
later it had jumped to 8118, 000.000 per
annum. It steadily increased to about
880,000,000 which was the annual
product at the beginning of the JJoer
war. It then fell to almost nothing
for a year or so, but in 1901 it was
again 1880,000,000. in 1905 it reached
8100,000,000; in lUOO it was more than
8120,000,000, and in 1907 the vast sum
of 8130,750,000/ These amounts are
inconceivable, 'but tbey are about
wbat the mine? are producing to-day.
Tbe aggregate ' dividends last year
wero S;io,OQ0,O00, and tbe mines whicb
paid tbenY'are capitalized at over
8120,000,00o! '1 have before me v
newspaper which gives the Droducts
of a dozen of tbe leading mining
companies during the past mouth,
None of them has paid iesa than
87,500 for every day of that month,
and some have run as 'high as 815,000
per day fbi tbe thirty days. Talk
about gold. Where will you ilnd it
elsowh'ero as here?
