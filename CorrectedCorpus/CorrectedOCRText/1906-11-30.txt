innumerable oher purposes, while he
bark is of grea alue as furnishin
an and yielding a bier exrac in con
inual demand for medicinal purposes
Bu of uses for he pice deails would
be well nigh endless The imber is in

briefly, he imber of his ree, consi

said o be more used han all oher

On he shores of Lake Nicaragua is
