irual confession of he uubenabiliy of he claim I aoids
liabiliy for perjury in swearing o a saemen known o be
false I pus he bill on he basis of an oercharge alone, a

 BILL TO REGULTE MINING
ssemblyman Ruherford of Neada couny has inroduced
a bill i he assembly proiding for he appoinmen of an in
specor of mines, wih he alleged objec of securing he beer
proecion of persons employed in underground operaions
I was inroduced January 12, and referred o he commiee
on mines and mining By he faor of assemblyman Moore,
we are in receip of a copy of his proposed law for he regula
ion of he mining indusry We do no beliee from a curs
ory examinaion of is proisions ha he bill will mee he
approal of hose engaged in he business of mining Is main
objec appears o be o proide snug berhs for hree more
sae officials, namely, an inspecor a a salary of $200 per
year, and a couple of depuies a $1500 each, wih all rael
ing, and incidenal expenses besides The 'purpor of he
a'c£ seems o be'humauiarian, namely, o see ha eery mine
employing no less han fie men is properly equipped wih
machinery, properly enilaed, and compeenly handled as
far as he proecion of he lies of employes is concerned
This is ruly a praiseworhy moie, bu he quesion is would
he measure accomplish his end, or would is endency no be
o reard raher han adance he business of mining in his
sae I is a false assumpion ha mine owners are careless
or indifferen abou he safey of he underground workers
0n he conrary, hey are fully as careful o proide agains
accidens as  railroads or oher large employers of labor
Mining is a hazardous business anyway, bu he risks in
separable herefrom are rarely augmened by indifference or
hearlessness on he par of he owner This' bill proides
ha upon receip of a complain in wriing, erified and
signed by hree or more persons—presumed o be employes —
a miue is dangerous in any way, or he machinery inadequae
or dangerous, or any person in charge of any machinery as
engineer or oherwise, is unskilled or incompeen, he in
specor is required o isi such mine, and make a horough
examinaion ino he charges If in his opinion he charges

There may be sunsets rare,
There may be landscapes stretching

And to the eye most fair.
But as for sights that really please
, A creature In a frock
With winning ways has all of them
, '• Pushed neatly off the block.
See as she trips along the way
With light, elastic tread '
Bhe turns the neck of every man
And likewise turns his head.
Though for appearance sake the stiu«
Is modified a bit.
■They'd like to follow her away
Did custom but permit.
There's nothing In the world can lenrt
Rich color to the scene
JCor brighten up a dreary day

She comes and tosscu back her head
In challenge pert, though prim.
And man confesses to himself
That she looks good to him.

"How did you like the restaurant?"
"It was just tolerable."
"I am surprised to hear you say It
They spare no expense there in getting
up their meals."
"Probably not. It wouldn't surprise
