CRE OF KI GLOVES
How o Mend Them and Keep Them
From Siffening
If when kid gloes are worn he
bands become ery ho and cause be
gloes o siffen and shriuk, French
chalk will proe a good remedy The
gloes should be pu on and he ips
of he fingers dipped in French chalk
and rubbed genly one agains he
oher, hen finally rubbed wih a sof
duser  lile French chalk should
also be pu in each finger
I is a good plan when wearing ring
under gloes o urn hem wih he
sones oward he palm of he hand
This no only preens marks, bu is
more comforable han when he rings
are worn he righ way up
Kid gloes should be remoed by
urning hem oer he hand and afer
ward urned righ side ou, blown ino,
he creases smoohed ou and finally
pu away in a gloe box
Nohing looks more unidy han o
see any one wearing a pair of gloes
wih he finger ips proruding or he
seams burs So if you spy een a iny
hole mend i wihou delay and wih
fine coon he same color as he kid
Neer use silk, as i cus on' break
off he coon, bu cu i, or you will
draw he siches oo ighly ogeher

heay rain ll he loose mud was
scraped off he surface of he road

secionsand laws.
The amounts which will go to the
various states are as follows: Ari
zona $51,220.38. Arkansas $2,904.44,
California $60,752.91, Colorado $50,
306.19, Florida $706.38, Idaho $66,74.55,

Utah $32,905.49, Washington $23,
671.89, Wyoming 534.704.54
Noteworthy is the especially heavy
increase over the amounts last year in
certain states. .In California the
amount rose by. over 25 per cent, in
Idaho ny over 352 per cent and in Ore
gon by nearly 50 per cent. The in
creases are the result of increased
activity in National forest timber sales
in these states and are an earnest of
what will happen as the timber supply
which the arovernment* is caring for
comes into full demand. Since the cut
of timber will always be limited to
what the forests will keep on growing,
the income to the states will be per
manent, not transitory, as would
have been the case if hasty and im
provident exploration had been per
mitted.

times what the forests are now yield-

for the government's timber.
Wedding Announcement
, Wedding announcements of Miss
I Florence Winnie Dufrene and Julius
M. Perano, to be celebrated on the
14th of this month, have been sent out
this week. Miss Dufrene is the
I daughter of Mr and Mrs Wrr. D. Du*
frene of Newmanville. For several
years she has been employed aa an as-
I sistant In the Jackson postomce. where
by her courteous and obliging disposi
tion, she won the respect and admira
tion of a large circle of friendß. She
has recently resigned from that posi
tion.
Mr Perano is the son of Mr and Mrs
Nicholas Perano, who reside .on a
ranch near Jackson Gate. He is em
ployed at the Kennedy mine, and is
very popular and highly respected by
all who know him.
A comfortable home has been fitted
up at 46 North Main, street, into
which the betrothed pair expect to
move, on their return from a long
wedding trip, which has also been ful
ly arranged for.
Miss Eva Perano will act as brides
maid, and Joseph Raggio as best man.
Croup is most prevalent during the
dry cold weather of the early winter
months. Parents of young children
should be prepared for it. All that is
needed is a bottle of Chamberlain's
cough remedy. Many mothers are
never without it in their homes and it
has never disappointed them. . Sold by
all dealers.
