 prolific cause of chronic Indigestion
is eating from habit and simply be
cause it is mealtime and others are
eatiug To eat when not hungry is to
eat without relish, and food taken
without' relish is worse than wasted
Without relish the saliary glands do
not act, the gastric fluids are not freely
secreted, and the best of foods will not
be digested Many perfectly harmless
dishes, are seerely condemned for no
other reason than they were eaten per
functorily and without relish and due

Hunger makes the plainest foods en
joyable It causes igorous secretion
and outpouring of all the digestie flu

of which no foods can be perfectly di

Wait for an appetite, if it takes a
week Fasting is one of the saing
graces It has a spiritual significance
only through its great physical and

is a bore or lunch a matter of indiffer

Wait for distance and unmistakable
hunger and then eat slowly If you
do this you need ask few questions as

what you eat, and it need not be pre

In Support of the Proposed ronstitution
al mendment for the Creation
of istrict Courts of
ppeal
The undorsigned, a Committee ap
pointed by the Bar ssociation of San
Francisco, beg to call your special at
tention to the proposed Constitutional
mendment proiding for istrict
Courts of ppeal, which proposed
amendment will be submitted to the
people at the general election to be
held Tuesday, Noember 8, 190
' We beliee that a change in the
judicial system of the state has become
an urgent public necessity, and we re
quest your earnest aid and coopera
tion towards the adoption of this
amendment *
; The statutes of California for the
year 1903, at page 737 et seq, set forth
in full the changes proposed
j The system of intermediate Courts
of ppeal has for many years been in
force in the United States courts, alo
in New York, Illinois and seeral other
states of the United States It has
been found to gie full satisfaction
' Shortly after the constitution of
1879 was adopted, it became apparent
that the supreme court could with
difficulty discharge the great mass of
business which een then was brought
before it s time progressed, HUjja
tion increased and the court became
more embarrassed In recent years
there has been an immense deelopment
of the resources, industries and mater
ial wealth of the state accompanied
by a great increase of population The
judical business of the state has in
creased in corresponding degree
I The supreme court still consists, as
it did in 188,u,af seen judges! It is
still required, in addition to business
pertaining to its original jurisdiction,
to hear and determine all appeals taken
from all the superior courts of the
state In the year 1885 it was found
necessary to do something for the re
lief of the supreme cput, and an act
of the legislature was passed authoriz
ing the appointment of three supreme
court commissioners Four years lat
er the legislature increased the number
of the supreme court commissioners
to fie nd yet the supreme court
was unable to keep down the eer in
creasing number of cases submitted to
it; it is now hoplessly in arrears This
condition of affairs is certainly not due
to indolence or neglect on the part of
the judges, as will sufficiently appear
from the fact that on an aerage the
court decides and flies written opinions
in six hundred and fifty cases each
year; in this particular its records com
pare faorably with any court in the
United Slates But as against this
large number of casess decided there is
an aerage of one thousand new cases
brought to the court each year The
capacity of the court for work is limit
ed, but the number of new cases is not,
and will increase w}th, the growth and
deelopment of the state Moreoer,
experience has demonstrated that when
a supreme court is much in arrears
with its work that condition alone
fosters an increase of litigation ; appeals
are taken for the sake  of the delay
which they inole, or for the purpose
of coercing the preailing party into a
compromise settlement
The present supreme court com
missioners hae no power to decide
cases; their proince is merely to pre
pare opinions to be adopted or rejected
by the judges It is manifest that the
judges must themseles examine the
cases befpre passing upon the commis
sioners' opinions, and so the wprk in
each case submitted to the commis
sioners is duplicated
Under the change now proposed the
fie commissioners will be relieed
from office and in their stead there will
be three separate district courts of
appeal, each consisting of three
judges sitting at the same time in
different parts of the state, and each
haing independent power to decide
and dispose of cases The supreme
court will, neertheless hqld the same
superisory power oer the district
courts which it now has oer its own
departments It is intended that
criminal appeals (except in cases where
the death penalty has been pronounc
ed), which now monopolize so much of
time of the supreme court shall be
heard by the district cpurts of appeal
Three district courts working con
currently should promptly take up and
dispose of criminal appeals, and so a
great present eil will be cprrected,
Criminals should be b,rought to justice
speedily i the criminal law loses its ter
rors when, as at present, coniction
and punishment can only be meted out,
if at all, seeral years after the com
mission of the crime
The objection to a multiplicity
of appeals does not apply to this amend
ment There is but one appeal as be
fore, to be taken, either to' thesuprem
court or to one of the district courts of
appeal It is true the supreme court
has tho power to reise any decision of
a district court of appeal, but it is not
obliged so to do Id this respect its
jurisdiction is similar to that of the
supreme court of the United States,
which has the power, although seldom
exercised, to reiew aoy decision of a
United States circuit court of appeals;
it is similar to tho power now held by
the California 3upreme_court in bane
(alsa seldom exorcised), to reise any
decision of the court rendered in dec of
its departments It is considered that
a reseration of such superisory  pow
er in the supreme court will hae an
influence for good upon the district
courts of appeal, and will insure uni
formity of their decisions throughout
the state ' r;_ ? 
The amendment proides for the dis
tribution of business from time to time
so that each of the district courts and
the supreme court shall always bear
its equal share of the judical labor
Under the amendment, the judical
busiuess of the state will thus be tran
sacted by four competent courts, act
ing concurrently, although there will
be the addition of only four judical
officers to the present judical staff
nd yet the supreme court will con
tinue to be, in case of need, the court
of final resort; haing at all times
power to take to itself and decide any
case, ciil or criminal, whateer may
be the amount of property, or the char
acter of the question inolyed
It is of the highest importance that
the present opportunity of amending
the system be aailed of If the amend
ment now proposed should fall to re
ceie a majority of otes, the present
deplorable condition of the supreme
court must continue until some other
measure can be brought before the
legislature and by that body again
submitted to a ote of the people, The
The present measure was prepared
with great care by a special commitee
acting in conference with other mem
bers of the bar, and with the judges
In oar opinion it is in eery respect
satisfactory We commend it to you
accordingly, and bespeak your aid in
its adoption _

The onecrop system of farming in
California will soon be a thing of the
past The broadspreading fJe!<Js of
wheat, coering thousands of acres,
will soon disappear, the , big grants
will be cut up and sold in small par
cels and I diersified farming, with
many homes, school houses and small
illages will take the place of the big
grain fields and the bunk houses and
sheds
The conseration of floodwaters be
hind big dams in storage reseroirs
will preent in a large measure rag
ing riers that burst their leees and
inundate the land adjoining them, and
irrigation will double and quadruple
the production of the lands of the two
big alleys When that day comes,
cows and sheep and pigs will be seen
on many a farm that neer knew
them before Poultry will be raised
and the farmer who went to the
illage formerly with nothing in his
wagon to sell at the store or market,
will, in that day, take eggs and chick
ens alie or dressed atift will bring
home his weekly lot of groceries and
other things bought with their pro
ceeds, instead of getting them on
credit and waiting till his wheat crop
is harested and sold
iersified farming in the East is
what has, when united with judgment
and system, made the Eastern farmer
independent and prosperous It gae
him a few sheep that cost him little
or nothing to raise, but brought him
a few dollars, and some fresh mutton
occasionally; a few hpgs whtch were
fed on the' bu^ermjlk or sliim milk
and swill and fastened with the
'nubbins" from the cornfield, filling
his barrel with pork and his smoke
house with hams, shoulders and
bacon; an animal to kill for beef each
Fall that had i*lso been cornfed;
plenty of ducks, chickens and turkeys
that brought him eggs the year round
that paid most of the grocery bill and
that brought good prices at Thanks
giing and Christmas time He raised
his own egetables and always had a
ariety fresh for his table instead of
buying wilted stuff from a huckster's
wagon He had plenty of fruit in
Rummer and plenty of apples and
cider in "Winder and/ as'fte' raised al
most eerything he used cm his table,
strikes that sent up the price of meat
or made it scarce had few terrors for
him and he was as nearly independent
as man can \>e, /
t the State Fair the farmer can
learn much that will be of alue to
him in relation to the arious
branches of diersified farming,
whether of stock of all kinds, or of
egetable products and the arieties
of grain best guided to his' soil, and
will fii,d plenty Pf exhibitors who will
gladly giye hj?n such information

JOHN BNISTER
n English Violinist Who Won Fame
In the Seenteenth Ccatnrr
; Public concerts owe their direct en
couragement to John Banister, who
had won fame by bis playing on the
iolin and who succeeded the cele
brated Baltzar as leader of Charles ll's
band of twentyfour iolins Pepys, In
an entry in his diary for February,
1667, tells us the court gossip of the
flay— "how the king's iallin Banister
is mad that the king bath a French
man come to be chief of some part of
the king's muslque"
Banister's concerts at the close of the
year 1672 were adertised in the Lon
don Guzette as followsPersonal "These are to
gie notice that at Mr John Banister's
house (now called the Mustek School),
oer against the George taern in
White Fryers, the present Monday will
be musick performed by excellent mas
ters, beginning precisely at  of the
clock in the afternoon, and eery after
noon for the future precisely at the
same hour"
Four years later on we read againPersonal
"t the cademy in Little Lincoln's
Inn Fields will begin the first part of
the Parley of Instruments, composed
by Mr John Banister" The admission
wns at this time as a rule a shilling,
and these concerts seem, to hae been
held pretty regularly down to within a
short time of Banister's death, which
took plnce In 1670— Chambers' Journal
BIRTH OF THE BUS
This Class of Vehicle First ppeared
In Paris In 1663!,
The omnibus appeared in Paris in
ICO2 ns a 'Vnrrosse a cinq sous" (coach
for twopence halfpenny), by authority
of Louis XIV, under the management
of rnscal, the mystic and philosopher
Whether this eminent thinker originate
etl tlm idea is uot clear, but there is no
doubt that hts influence assisted In the
establishment of the serice under the
auspices of a royal decree
Later on these earliest omnibuses
ceased to ran owing to lack of support,
and did not reappear in Paris until
1827 when Lafltte, the banker, who
wns among the largest proprietors,
was credited with originating the re
ied serice
The new coaches started to ply In
London ou July , 1820, when the first
one left Taddlngton for the Bank oj
England, and another ran from the
bank to the Yprkshlre Stingo, New
road These flrat British busses wert
known from the man who organized
them as "Shlllibeerß," and the conduc

China Gets the Credit For Haing
First Made Them
The earliest makers of straw hats
were unquestionably the Chinese
Their work was by no means rough
In character, but plaited and sewn to
gether with considerable skill, as may
be seen today in the neighborhood of
Canton
In Europe hats were first made in
Paris by a Swiss so early as 10, and
we find mentioned among the entries
of an Inentory of the effects of Sir
John Fastolfe, 150, "four strawen
hattes," showing them to hae been
great rarities  Coryatt mentions them
as worn in Proence, with a hundred
seems, lined with slier and curiously
worked
Tuscany, with Leghorn as a center,
took up the work early In the fifteenth
century and has maintained it with
considerable skill eer since Bedford
shire, with unstable and Luton as
centers, has been the headquarters of
the industry in England eer since the
early part of the seenteenth century

Matt Carpenter, the  famous Wis

fore the supreme court Before he had
got half through with his argument the
judges had made np their minds that
his case was without merit, and, more
oer, that he was unprepared When
he finished his argument and counsel
for the other side got up to reply, the
judges whispered to each other, nodded
and then the chief justice said, "I don't
think it will be necessary to bear from
you, sir" Carpenter's opponent was
deaf, and he could only tell that the
Chief justice was addressing him He
turned to Carpenter for aid "What
did the chief justice say, Matt?" he
whispered "He said he'd rather gie
you the case than listen to you," Car

Ten Cents Per Copy,
CHURCH LES
n Old English Custom That Waa
Suppressed In 1603
From almost the earliest times  In ;
England "church ales" were often gi'
en in a building adjoining any church,
where were a hearth of good compass 
and a stout oaken table upon which
the "ale" and iands were set forth
The founder of the feast gae his best
brew and was content to receie mon
ey in exchange, the spirit animating
these quasi religious symposia being
akin to that which obtains at the mod
ern charity bazaar— that is to say, all
who attended were prepared to pay lib
erally or een dearly for their fare
Thus the man who had lost his mon
ey and was "down on his luck" would
gie a "bid (begging) ale" that, if he
was popular, might suffice to set him
on his feet again The more romantic
"bride ale" assisted penurious young
couples into housekeeping, while a pro
saic "Whltsun ale" was furnished by,
churchwardens, who used, to raise'
money for the poor, for church repairs
or other pressing cause, the malt pre
iously presented to them and stored!
in the tithe barns
ancing was indulged in at such
"church ales," and if the season werei
propitious an adjournment might be
made, to an adjacent meadow, ; where
archery, quintain and other diersions
would ensue But excesses became
more and more frequent, so that tri 
1603 "church ales" were summarily
suppressed X^
The Juenile Japanese
There are no children in Japan They
are dignified burlesques on the grown
ups The little girls of the family take
care of the babies by haing them
strapped to their backs Nearly eery,
maid of fie or six has a baby tied to
her back, and perhaps that accounts
for the bent back and tottering gait of
the Japanese woman Though one
neer hears a Jap baby cry, if one be
gins to make a mouth and wrinkle ur
its funny little face, its child mother
quiets it by raising her body on her
toes and heels as fast as she can, and
placidity reigns in short order  man
would feel like a fool quoting "Mother
Goose" to a Japanese child or trying
to amnse it as one does our children
s for chucking one under the chin,
that's unthinkable

LILIES OF HELTH N BEUTY
In a recent interiew with Mrs Lily
langtry, she ery wisely, said Personal
"The fact that I beliee in the superior
force of mind oer matter does not blind
me to the truth that the foundation of eery
successful life is good health; that the key
Btone to physical beauty is perfect physical
health  
" sick woman cannot be a beautiful
woman, nor can she be anything but what
we English call a poorspirited woman
"To a great extent a woman's beauty it
measured by her jtality — by her health
"Work, Sunshine, Exercise, Water and
Soap, Plain, Nourishing Food, Lots of
Fresh ir, and a Happy, Contented Spirit
— there, as you say, 'honest and true,' is
my working rule for youth, yonthful spirits
and youthfullooks"
One great secret of youth and beauty for
the young woman or the mother is the
proper understanding of her womanly sys
tem and wellbeing Eery woman, young
or old, should know herself and her phys
ical makeup  good way to arrie at this
knowledge is to get a good doctor book,
such for instance as "The People's Common

REPUBLICN LOCL OUTLOOK
* The political outlook from both a
republican and democratic stand
point, so far as mador county is
concerned, is more complicated than
for seeral years past From the
returns of the last general election
the republicans hae an aerage
margin of 150 otes oer the demo
crats Pardee's majority was below
the aerage, being 86; Lane, the
democratic notninee for goernor,
was about 100 otes stronger than his
party in this county Eery man on
the republican state ticket carried
the county by a substantial major
ity^ Indeed 86 for Pardee was the
lowest majority on the stale and con
gressional tickets" Curry, for secre
tary of state, receied 309 majority
in the county On clearcut party
lines between republicans and demo
crats, it may be safely calculated
that the republicans hae 150 otes
more than their opponents This
year the possible injection of the
labor organization into politics may
disturb these figures To what ex
tent this disturbing factor • may
break into the old party ranks can
not be foreseen, and it is useless to
speculate upon such a proposition
While the republicans as far as
the state and congressional tickets
are concerned made an excellent
showing, rolling up a substantial
majority for eery candidate, when
the field of local candidates comes
under inestigation the result is
ery disappointing mador coun
ty republicans can ote well for out
siders, but for members of their own
party running for local or state
offices they hae not made a corres
pondingly satisfactory showing
Only three local meu secured a ma
jority McKenney for assembly
man by 77, T K Norman for sheriff
by 223, and J Marchant by 815
otes The rest of the official plums
were gien to the democrats by de
cisie majorities It is well for re
publicans to ponder oer this mat
ter; find out the causes which hae
contributed to this wholesale • deser
tion of local candidates by republi
cans, and apply the remedy, if a
remedy^ is possible The logic of the
facts stated is that republicans hae
faith in the national and state man
agement of the party, and the candi
dates presented — confidence enough
to ote tbe ticket — but local issues
and candidates do not come up to
the notion of tbe rank and file to
carry them to ictory It is un
questionably true that republicans
as a rule pay more regard to national
and state politics, while the demo
crats are more concerned to secure
the local offices It is on national
issues that party principles are
pressed to the front, and control the
actions of the oters In county
affairs the personnel' of the candi
date is often the potent factor, and
party allegiance is relegated to the
background That is to say, it
takes less ground to alienate repub
lican support from a candidate for a
local office than for a state or nation
al office It must not be inferred,
howeer, that een in local affairs
republicans are disposed to act ar
bitrarily, and scratch their ticket
merely for the sake of scratching
The Ledger is not an adocate of
blind adherence to party ticket If
an unfit man is put up for office, it
is a duty a man owes to himself and
the cause of good goernment to
ote against him This sort of inde
pendence is too sacred and ital to
the welfare of the community to ad
mit of discussion Loyalty to party
must be subordinate to loyalty to
country and home interests But
when candidates against whose char
acter and fitness nothing can be said
are scratched, the effect is demora
lizing in the extreme It is this ten
dency that is discouraging, and the
cause of it must be remoed ere we
can hope to succeed to the extent
warranted by our numerical superi
ority It is the duty of those elect
ed on the republican ticket to stand
by those who helped to elect them
If they do not do this they forfeit all
claim to support as party men The
idea of casting aside those whose
fealty has been proen, and reach
ing out, by the disposal of patron
age, to those who hae not support
ed them, in the belief that such a
course is calculated to gather otes,
is icious and cannot be upheld by
any rightthinking man The trouble
with the republicans of mador
county is there has been too much
of the hobnobbing spirit manifested
toward democracy In some quar
ters the true republican ring is lack
ing in the political makeup There
is too much of the mugwump, half
way spirit Some imagine that a
combination with democratic office
holders, a sort of republicandemo
cratic brotherhood for mutual pro
tection and benefit, is the road to
political adancement They argue
that they will lose nothing of their
hold on republican, oters by such
training in the opposition camp,
while at the same time they will
make themseles inulnerable by
patronizing the other side This
is a fatal mistake No party de
seres success that adopts such a
course s a party the republicans
of mador do not approe of such
trimming Neertheless we hae
suffered, and are still suffering from
such trimmers The abuse must be
stopped Members of a minority
party may find excuse for bidding
for outside support They hae to
break in on tlie other side to win
But republicans in mador county
hae only to hold their party ote
in order to win When oters hae
confidence that candidates after
election will do the right thing, they
will be apt to stand up to the party
ticket, and not till then
PROMISES KEPT
( From The Philadelphia Inquirer )
"We hae made the deed square
with the word," said President
Rooseelt, in accepting the nomina
tion officially tendered him by Speak
er Cannon ;'Personal /
That is another way of saying that
the Republican party has kept its
promises to the people
Is not the country contented under
Rooseelt?
The gold standand has been main
tained and made a fixture, so that
een Judge Parker, who twice sup
ported and oted for the party and
candidate of free siler, acknowl
edges it
Business interests hae been
strictly guardhd from all disturbing
influences, so far as Republican
Congress and a careful administra
tion could do so
Steps hae been taken to put an
end to criminal combinations de
signed to restrain trade
In foreign affairs there has been a
steady insistence for open ports in
the Far East to commerce meri
can citizens hae been protected in
their rights There hae been no
dangerous foreign entanglements
On the contrary, tbe administra
tion's policy, while it has been pos
itie, has made for peace The  re,
suit is that the merican nation is
respected eerywhere
This being the case, how can the
party of the opposition hope to carry
tbe country under no better plea
than that a charge of administra
tion is desirable
GET REGISTERE
We again call the attention of re
publican oters to the necessity of
getting registered at once Remem
ber that in order to ote at the
forthcoming presidential election,
eery citizen must be reregistered
In conformity with a law passed
seeral'years ago, a new registration
of oters is required for eery gen
eral election The county clerk is
now engaged in this work Regis
tration will close September 28th,
forty days before the electionPersonal The
work is proceeding slowly There is
a backwardness, not unusual in the
early part of all campaigns, mani
fested by' citizens on this subject
They are apt to put it off from time
to time, arguing that there is ample
time yet to attend to this duty By
this sort of procrastination more or
less otes are lost eery election
We urge upon eery unregistered
republican to see to it that he reg
isters the first time he isits Jack
son, or any other town where a
deputy clerk is authorized to per
form this work California is firmly
planted in the republican column,
but it can only be kept there by due
diligence ot republicans in getting in
line to exercise their rights as citi
zens Besides there are important
state and local issues iuoled in the
coming contest at the ballot box It
behooes eery patriotic citizen to
realize that the duty deoles upon
him as an indiidual to do his part
in behalf of good goernment, in
nation, state and county, by the
conscientious exercise of his pri
ileges as a oter
BRYN'S VIEW OF NOMINTION
I hae nothing to take back, I hae
nothing to withdraw of the things
that I hae said against the methods
pursued to adance his candidacy
It was a plain and deliberate attempt
to deceie the party The New
York platform was ague and pur
posely so, because the adocates of
Judge Parker were trying to secure
otes from among' the people who
would hae opposed his iews had
they known them  * The
nomination was secured, therefore,
by crooked and indefensible
methods — William Jennings Bryan
The Republican party meets lie
issues; the democratic party dodges
them
The chief plank in eery emo
cratic platform is a confession that
the party  was wrong in the last
campaign
The fact remains that Bryan
fought for his colors at St Louis,
while ae Hill sought to gold brick
the delegates
emocrats assert that the Chicago
conention was cut and dried Yes,
but tbe cutting and drying was done
by tbe people and not in the back

POLITICL NOTES
Republican primaries were held
throughout the county last Saturday
eenit" There was no contest any
where except in looe, where two tickets
were brought out on the superisor's
question One ticket faored the re
nomination of W M mick, and the
other G Joses Both sides caucused,
and decided upon the ticket to be run
in the interest of each faction The
controersy was really a continuation
of the antisaloon agitation which has
kept the alley town in a furor for
some time The partisans worked
hard in their respectie spheres, and
nearly 150 otes were polled The
mick side won out two to one This
89ttles the question of the superisor
nominee on the republican side
J Clifton and J Q Horton hae
been mentioned as probable candidates
for superisor 'in this district before
the democratic conention
In Township One the republicans are
united that S W Bright is the strong
est man to make the race for super
isor He is not a candidate in the
usual acceptation of that term; that is,
he Is not, and neer has been, a seeker
after office, If the nomination is ten
dered him he will accept and make the
run Under these circumstances it is
not likely that an  other name will be
presented to the conention, as it is
realized that Mr Bright, by large
business experience, sound judgment
and integrity is the right man for the
place On the democratic side M
Newman is urged for renomination
He has been in office but one term, and
it is out o' ordinary course to refuse a
renomination where the officeholder,
as in his case, has gien satisfaction to
his party nother candidate, how
eer, has appeared in the democratic
ranks In the person of John Strohm,
proprietor' of the Jackson Brewery
He wants tbe nomination, and it is re
ported, if be fails to secure the honor,
he may conclude to run independent,
or as a candidate with tbe labor union
backing '
In Township Four there is no ques
tion that the republicans will tender
the nomination to Morris Brinn,  a
former superisor from that township,
and whose work on the roads during
his official term has commended him to
the support of the citizens without re
gard to party, There is some talk of
tbe democrats nominating C E Jaris
of the steam laundry It is also re
ported that H  Calin, of mador
City, who Is identified with the Miners'
union of that district, wants to run as
a labor union candidate It is not at
all improbable that there will be a
triangular contest
The democratic county conention
has been called to meet in Jackson next
Saturday, tbe same date as the repub
lican This is the first time in the
history of the county, so far as our
recollection seres us, that the two
local conentions hae been called to
meet In the same town and on the same
day The republicans made the first
call, and their gathering will meet in
the courtroom Tbe democratic body
will conene in Loe's hall It seems
that the democratic state conention
meets next Monday, and there was no
way of getting out of the difficulty ex
cept by getting the conention on Sat
urday It is understood that both con
entions will proceed with all the busi
ness to be transacted, namely, the se
lection of delegates to the state con
entions, which will also be empowered
to act in the assembly and congressional
conentions; also the selection of a new
county central committee and the nom
ination of three superisors in their re
spectie districts, namely, districts one,
two, and four
In township four there was a liely
tilt at the democratic primaries last
Tuesday Sutter Creek elected dele
gates faorable to the candidacy of 
 Fraser for superisor mador
City went for H  Calin s Sutter
Creek outotes mador in the con
ention, it is conceded that Fraser will
be the democratic candidate It is
thought that the socialist or union
forces will get Into the tight, with Cal
in as their candidate  three cor
nered struggle in townships one and
four is promised
Railroad Progress
Eerything now points toward the
completion of the railroad as far as
Mar toll's station at an early date It
is belieed that the Southern Pacific is
behind the enterprise, and if so it will
unquestionably be put through with
out delay Sureyors are out making
a more careful surey for grade than
has heretofore been done This is
taken to mean that the road will be
adapted for steam traffic; that steep
grades, which would not be a serious
obstacle in an electric line, are to be
aoided as much as possible  large
force of graders and brush cutters are
at work s the route is now indicated
the line will cross the lone wagon road
at least four, if not fie times

oftener when occasion demands In
addition to the usual business, Mr
Bricker looked into the libelous anony

SHOOTING SCRPE
Charles ickerman, a Union Picket at Fre
mont, Btiot at Near mador City
Three Shots Fired, One Taking
Effect in the Leg — Three
NonUnion Ken Under
, rrest
mador City has furnished a sensa
tional news Hem this week in the shape
of a shooting affair that occurred near
that town on Wednesday night The
ictim is Charles ickerman, aged
about 38 years, one of the ickerman
family of Quartz Mountain icker
man is a member of mador City
Miners' Union When the strike oc
curred at the Fremont he was omploy
ed as a union picket to watch In the
Interest of the strikers For seeral
weeks, howeer, he had been off duty
He had been drinking some, and
temporarily off guard Wednesday
eening, as the story goes, he was on
his way to mador City on horseback
He passed the saloon of Sbealor &
Win ram, Personal quarter of a mile beyond
mador City, about 8 o'clock 
short distance from this place he met
three men — nouunion employes of the
Fremont— who were proceeding toward
the saloon One ersion is that ick
erman made a remark for the men to
look out, as he had an unruly horse
When ickeruian reached mador he
reported that he had been shot It is
reported that two shots were fired at
him, one of which took effect in the
calf of the left leg nother bullet
passed through bis bat  doctor was
called and examined the wound It is
thought that the ball lodged between
the two bones Tbe wound is not con
sidered serious The three men whom
ickerman met were J H Hinokly,
James Forbes and F Sexton They
went oq to tbe saloon in question, and
stayed there for half an hour, after
which they proceeded to the Fremont
boarding house, near the mine They
were arrested on the road by deputy
sheriff  S Gray, charged with being
concerned in tbe shooting They were
brought to Jackson the same night
and lodged In jail
The deputy sheriff heard the men
talking before he made the arrest
They were referring to the rough con
dition of tbe road, and said they would
not enture away again at night time
There was nothing to indicate in their
talk that they had been in any trouble
They started out from the mine that
eening to look up a fellow workman
at New Chicago; not finding him there
they proceeded to mador They ad
mitted meeting ickerman on the road,
and after passing him they heard two
shots; further than this they knew
nothing • Superintendent Goodall
takes the position that if bis men get
into trouble outside the premises he
wants the law to be indicated; and as
soon as he heard they were suspected
he wanted them taken in charge for
the raens' own protection if innocent,
and the maintenance of the law if
guilty The feeling was strong, as
soon as tbe facts were stated, that the
three men had npthing tp do wjth it
ickerman himself said they were not
mixed up with it; he was inclined to
think that  S Gray, the deputy
sheriff, did the shooting This Idea
was still wide of the mark, as Gray was
at the Fremont when the shooting took
place
Thursday night a man named John
Torto, an Italian employed at the
Bunker Hill mine, was arrested by
deputy sheriff Gray on suspicion of
committing the crime He was on the
road at the time, with a heay pack on
his back, and making his way put pf
the county He soon made a full con
fession, admitting thst he dfr} the
shooting ' He sh^t t*)pe" at p,}cker
tnan His explanation Is thst he was
sitting on the roadside when icker
man rode up; Torto is a nonunion
man; that be had been much annoyed
by the efforts of the union men to get
him to join the union; that ickerman
bad appealed to him in this behalf
When icker dj an saw him by the rfi^d
he stopped apd hlfli Sflcl
proceeded to dismount, ffe pleaded tp
beletalpne; be was, frightened; and jn
his terror hP drew Ws" gun aM fired
twice Tortp was lodged In the coun
ty jail The other three men were
liberated last night, and proceeded
back to the mine
The mystery of the affair is fully
cleared up by this confession, and con
siderable agitation in the icinity of
mador has been thereby allayed

 BIG BREK IN
PLNT'S PIPE LINE
The Standard Electric Plant is Seerely
amaged—  Shutown for at Least
a Week The ynamos Coered
with ebris from the
Mouitain
Probably the worst disaster that has
oertaken the big electric plant of the
Standard Electric Company at Electra,
occurred about 12 o'clock Friday night,
ugust 11 || The ordinary pressure
under which the fie dynamos has been
operated is UOOfeet! This is oer 250
feet less pressure than a full bead It
had been deemed inadisable to utilize
the immense pressure of the full fall of
1650 feet, as it was feared by some that
a portion of the pipe would be unable
to stand the strain The olume of
water running on the wheels from fie
3inch nozzles was oer 5000 inches — a
stream sufficient to supply the largest
city in the United States with water for
domestic purposes The power gen
erated by the fie dynamos, operating
to their full capacity, was 1000 horse
power,' sent principally, to the cities
around the bay of San Francisco, oper
ating street car lines in Oakland and
San Jose To economize water the
company sent up word to utilize the
full head  Consequently the additional
250 feet was turned on early Friday
morning, aud this experiment brought
speedy disaster Many street car lines
stop running about midnight, and
the reduced demand for power is met
by shutting down one or more dyna
mos, the sudden stoppage naturally
throwing increased pressure upon the
pipe line It was this extra strain or
jar — the first after the utilization of the
full bead— that led to the trouble The
pipe line is composed of heay steel
pipe, except toward the head which is
of cast iron, and the additional head of
250 feet from the cast Iron to the Intake
is of wood The cast Iron pipe is three
quarters of an inch thick The sudden
jar blew out a piece of this pipe 8 feet
long and 13 inches, wide Such was
the power of the water 'een at this
distance up the hill, that this mass —
weighing nearly half a ton— was car
ried300 feet down the bill The gap
opened a rier Fie thousand inches
of water was turned loose, tearing down
the hillside for 100 feet, and striking
the power house at the bottom with
the force of an aalanche, carrying
loose soil and large boulders In its path
The wooden pipe aboe the break
collapsed from the acuum when the
water was turned off front the head of
the line The power house was coered
two or three feet deep with mud and
debris The galanized iron siding of
the power house was stoe in where
the force of the water struck it, as if
fashioned of paper The dynamos were
coered up in the mud sluices, while
the wheels kept reoling for some
time after the accident, scattering the
mud oer the whole machinery It
was about 30 minutes after the break
occurred before the water was shut off
and the machinery was brought to a
complete standstill Fortunately, the
steel pipe line below the point of the
break is mounted on concrete piers,
and thereby escaped injury On either
side of the piers the hillside has been
washed out considerably by tb,e ru,sh,
of wqter
Th,e dain,age is estimated at fully
$30,0QQ, beside the loss of reenue en
tailed by the stoppage Two tons of
new pipe arried Tuesday by express
Oer 100 men were put to work clear
ing out the mud from, th,e power house,
and freeing the machinery frpm the
debris long (t will tal^e to get
the plant In full wp,rk(n,g order again, is
npt known, \% is to supply
power far the mines and mills by the
end of this week The dynamos are
deluged with water, and they must be
thoroughly dry before carrying a full
load, on account of the danger of burn
ing out on account of ?ncstura 'l'ho
cast iron pipe will tie replaced with
stee;  •
The merican lUyer Opinpany was
able tp supply %bo,iit }SQO, hp,rsa power
to, tide tb,e ?tandar Eleotrio Company
oer the difficulty The mines were
shut off from power for a few hours,
until the merican Rier plant was
called into requisition Of course, th,e
energy aailable i r^m, th,ls sou,rce (alls
far short pf meeting the demand The
repair pj the break wjlj n,o floubt be

There Is no other plant in the world
operating under such hi?h pressure

COUNTY'S MINES
Sawyer— This claim is situated near
the Mokelumne rier, in Pioneer dis
trict  gentleman named Newman,
of San Francisco, is operating with a
force of eight men in running a tunnel
to tap the ledge at a distance of 150
feet from the surface They hae
about 50 feet further to run to reach
the ledge This claim was formerly
known as the Pine mine, and has
yielded rich rock in years past
Wide wake— t this mine, "which
is in Railroad Flat mining district,
Calaeras county, a peculiar state of
affairs is presented The ore assays $10
and $11 per ton, but seeral milling
tests hae proed unaailing in saing
more than from 50 cents to $1 per ton
The tailings show gold alue of about
$10 If any method can be deised to
sae a fair percentage of the gold, the
property may be made a remuneratie
one The rock is not eidently of the
free milling character Geo I Wright
has had an expert from San Francisco
isit the mine recently, an experienced
assayer and mineralogist, who after a
thorough examination gae It as his
opinion that the ore might be treated
by the cyanide process The manage
ment has decided to fix up a small
plant to test this treatment n
assessment of oce cent per share has
been leied for this purpose The ore
differs materially in character from
other gold ores in that icinity There
is little doubt some method can be de
ised to recoer the gold The prob
lem may take a little time, and inole
considerable experimenting to sole
Treadwell— Tuesday of this week
it was our good fortune to meet per
sonally Messrs J Schenck and J
Oneta, general manager and foreman
respectiely of the Sutter Creek Gold
Company, who are operating at this
mine, and to be shown by them the ex
tent of present deelopments To a
person who was familiar with the mine
and its history as we were, it Is sur
prising to see what has been done in so
short a time The 5stamp mill is one
of the most substantial we hae eer
seen The water supply is unlimited,
and the ore from eery tunnel is of a
grade that will make the mine a good
diidend proposition when the com
pany seoures a larger mill The object
of the 5stamp mill being to test the
ore chutes thoroughly So far results
hae been most flattering, and the
company is securing adjoining proper
ties Two tunnels 500 feet in length
hae already been run, following the
eins which hae proen to be from 3
to 10 feet in width  shaft $ by 1
feet Is being sunk on the main ledge,
and Is now 3Q feet deep The rock is

"Oh, yes," a man in the hotel lobby
was oerheard to say "I'm a real

about $75 per month now, so you can

was heard to comment upon farm

"It's all right to talk about tiie poetry

 Custom of the merican Colonies
Before the Reolution
Before the Reolution, ministers of
the nglican church in those merican
colonies *here that church was estab
lished by law were remunerated "In
kind" instead of in money Maryland
gae an incumbent forty pounds of to
bacco a year for eery tithe payer in
the parish, whether churchman or dis
senter, white or colored These terms
were handsome enough to secure the
pick of the clerical market In Vir
ginia the stipends represented a fixed
and unarying quantity, by weight, of
the manufactured leaf These stipends
were rather beggarly in quantity In
a bad year een the "sweet scented
parishes," where the minister's salary
was calculated on a high priced and
exceptionally fragrant tobacco, yielded
only about $500 a year The parishion
ers sometimes refused to induct a cler
gyman unless he would consent to take
one salary for sering two parishes In
1758, when the price of tobacco j had
greatly risen, the house of burgesses
passed a law fixing the cash equialent
of debts payable in tobacco at one
third their true alue, thus wiping out
twothirds of the incomes of ministers
Patrick Henry made his first fame in
defending this law when a test case
was brought in behalf of the injured
clergymen
 ead Moose
When a bull moose lies dead in the
forest he looks like some strange ante
diluian animal, with his square pre
hensile muffle and horns spreading lat
erally, a peculiarity which he shares
with the prehistoric Irish elk and the
nearly extinct European elk of later
times The huge form tells of strength
and swiftness, and withal the still dan
gerous gleam of the eye, glazed in its
last stare, bids the hunter pause and
feel almost guilty of a crime in the de
struction of so much that is grand and
weird, a feeling ery different from the
sentiment supposed to attend the
slaughter of a deer But the triumph
of mastering the wariest and braest
animal In the woods by fair still hunt
Ing and by grimly sticking to the track
for many a weary mile amply atones
for any regrets — Century
Sneak Thiee* In Churches
n old sexton was discussing the
amount of stealing that is done in
churches "Scarcely a day passes," he
said, "when the church is open with
out some distracted woman coming to
me bowed down with grief because
somebody has stolen her purse There
are certain contemptible thiees who
prey on unsuspecting women who
pray so hard that they forget to look
after their pocketbooks The thief
watches until the woman is deep In
prayer and then leans oer, grasps the
purse and sneaks out"— Philadelphia

 Curious Tribe, Loir own In the

 hunter of big game in frica gies
a description of a tribe of naties
whom he found there, the Watwa
"These naties," he says, "lie in the
swamps, their staple article of diet be
Ing fish and flour made from the seed
of the water lily, although during the
rains they grow patches of • cassaa
root and sweet potatoes at the edge
of the swamp They smear their
bodies with mud to protect them from
mosquitoes and are extremely dirty
and eil smelling in consequence They
are ery low down in the scale of hu
manity and hae a bad reputation
nmong tribes liing on the high ground,
which reputation they upheld during
our isit We engaged seeral Watwa
naties as carriers, but they only came
to see what they could steal One day
I shot a reed buck in sight of the
camp and left two Watwa to carry it
In while I went after a hartbeest, but
I neer saw either men or buck again
It was no use following them into the
swamps, as they knew eery Inch
of the ground and water They had
small canoes hidden eerywhere, and
Immediately they crossed a stream
they sunk the canoe again where they
alone knew where to find It Our boys
were afraid to ' follow them, as they
used poisoned arrows and sometimes
set poisoned stakes ln the tracks lead
ing to their haunts"
ME JULIN BERNER
#he Was a Fifteenth Century uthor
ity on Fly Fishing
The* first printed English book on
angling was ame Juliana Berner's
"Book of St lbana," which appeared
about 150, and contained a chapter
entitled " Treatyse on Fyshynnge
With an ngle"
Fly fishing must hae been practiced
much earlier than this, as nothing but
a gradual eolution could account for
the complete list of flies for the fish
ing months of the year which it gies
To ame Berner belongs the honor
of first telling that the salmon could
be caught with the fly She saysPersonal "l
so ye may take hym, but it is 6eldom
seen with a dubbe at such times as
when he lepith in lyke fourme and
manere as ye do a trought or a gray
ling" Her knowledge seems more
complete than could hae been that
of the original "inentor, so that the
timo when fly fishing originated in
British waters must remain uncertain
ame Berner's flies will kill trout
today, and her twele were the foun
dation of those of which Izaak Wal
ton said quaintly in 1653Personal "Thus hae

BOY OF THE REGIMENT
With His yingPersonal Breath Be alced
Garibaldi For a Coffln
When Enzo Ferretti entered actiely
Into the Italian war of Independence
he was Just seenteen He left Parma
secretly, deserting, as It were, his fa
ther, mother and family to fight for his
hero, Garibaldi He walked oer the
pennines without a penny ln bis pock
et and, arriing half dead at Genoa,
concealed himself on one of the ships
bound for Sicily When at his destina
tion he emerged and gained the nick
name of the "boy of the regiment"
From that time for some months he
fought until the day for rest came He
wns shot In the head and carried to
the hospital in a dangerous condition
Eerything possible was done for him,
but it was eident that he was trou
bled, and at last It came_out that he
could not die_ happy because he had
neer seen his hero "I hae fought
eerywhere and sought always," he ex
clnime;l "but I hae neer succeeded
ln seeing him How can I die neer
haing caught a glimpse of him?"
nother preoccupation was that be
feared he might be buried without a
coffin Morning, noon and night bis
cry was, "Let me hae a coffin 1" The
ery day he died, by a fortunate
chance Garibaldi arried at the hos
pital Haing heard Ferretti's story,
he stooped and spoke to him The sick
boy's expressie face lighted up and
be exclaimedPersonal "Now I can die happy
Oh, general, let me hae a coffln!"
TRGIC IN ITS BREVITY
The Story of the uel Between Ham
ilton and Burr
The story of the HamiltonBurr duel
is tragic in its breity The little party
of fie— the principals, ' their seconds
and the surgeon— was on the ground
not long after sunrise The prelimi
naries were soon arranged s Pen
dleton,' Hamilton's second, gae him
his pistol, he asked, "Will you hae
the hairspring set?" _ 
"Not this time," was the significant
reply, and then the men faced each
other
ccording to the best authorities up
on a disputed subject, Burr fired at the
word t the report, Hamilton started
forward with a conulsie moement,
reeled, Inoluntarily discharging his
pistol into the foliage aboe him, and
fell headlong Burr, with an expres
sion of pain upon his face, sprang to
ward him, but Van Ness, his second,
seized him by the arm and hurried him
down the bank and into their boat
I Hamilton, being lifted up, reied
for a moment and gasped, "This Is a
mortal wound, doctor!" Relapsing
again into unconsciousness he wae
again reied by the fresh air of the
rier "Pendleton knows," he said,
trying to turn toward his friends, "that
I did not intend to fire at him"
t 2 the afternoon following he
had breathed his last
Monster Bowl of Punch
In 160 dmiral Edward Russell,
commander of the English Mediterra
nean fleet, ' entertained 6,000 people 1c
a large garden In licante, where ht
sered the largest bowl of punch eei
brewed It contained twenty gallons ol
lime juice, four hogsheads of bandy,
one pipe of Malaga wine, twentyflt
hundred lemons, thirteen hundred
weight of fine white sugar, three pack
ages of toasted biscuits, fiftyone
pounds of grated nutmegs and eight
hogsheads of water
| The whole was preented from dilu
tion In case of rain by a large canopy,
which spread oer a marble fountain
bowl which held the punch The punch
was sered by a boy, who rowed aboul
the basin of the fountain In a boal
built for the purpose and refilled the
empty cups
Two Scotcb Stories
Personal  Scotch schoolmaster in Banffshirc
years ago had strong iews on the sub
ject of dress In the day when crino
line was the rage a girl came to school
Vltb a ery extensie one, which much
exceeded the space between the desk
and the form on which she had to sit
The teacher, seeing this, said to her,
"Gang awa' home and tak' off that
girds (hoops) and come back to the
school as God made ye"
nother rough and ready dominie
was examining his boys in a catechism
and asked if God had a beginning
"No," said the boy "Will he hae an
end?" "Yes," he replied This was
followed instantly by a bullet on the
Bide of the head ''Will he hae an
end noo?" ''No," said the boy, and the
master was satisfied
Ttnnjnon'i "Married Brow*"

nounced the literary man "Ton know
Tennyson's linePersonal
"The charm of married brows
"JVell, did he mean by that the
crowning charm of married women, oi
did he refer to the charm of eyebrows
that meet in the middle? In the
'rabian Nights' there are many pas
sages in which such eyebrows art
spoken of as a great charm, indeed, but
In the west our beauty doctors gie
explicit directions to preent such
