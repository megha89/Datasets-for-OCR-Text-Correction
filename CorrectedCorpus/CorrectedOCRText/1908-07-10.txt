Talsdale and gnha Leslie Ba Id he

works secreary's Rnoou cropped
lawn The girl looked fresh aud dain
y in her long whie diess; bu Taia
dalo, who wore plain blue serge,
fleened soraowha ou of place a a
gnrdeu pary Ho was a big, and us
ually somewha silen mnn, wih a me
chanic's ingrained bauds, and a
houghful fuce Uni, had grown palld
from long nigh waches heside ire
less machines, lie was here parly
beoaUßß he secreary, who disregarded
his wife's proess, had insised upon
I, mid for anoher reuson ha con
cerned himself
"I ia in one way, a proof of your
uourage as well aa kindness o si here
and alk o mo," he said, wih a half
ironical smile as he glanced a be
fashionable assembly
gaha Leslie undorsood him,
hough she would no, of course, ad
m Kirn had gien up wondering
why his man, who was oeralul uo
of her Be, ineresed her ua he did
"Why?" she asked
TaisdaJe laughed "I am, of course,
wha I beliee is culled an ousider,
and a lile while ago be gaes of
your world would neer hae been
opened o me 1 don' know ha 1
would hae cared o ener hem"
"nd now?"
"In one way s amusing o sep
inside be pale, a only a few
monhs since seeral of hese people
who hae ried wih uo grea ac o
paronize me passed me eery duy
wihou a glance Hill here is a good
deal in your life ha appeals o one
—is quie orderliness— your opporu
niies of enjoying ar and music—
among oher hings"
"ion seem o know as much abou
hem as we do," said be girl, who
had realized ha ac some ime ago
"Haen' you equal opporuniies
now you hae inened be Taisdale
nillV"
The man smiled dryly
"My paen brough oo we'll say
a enh par o wha i should hae
done 1 was a rifle couiding and lef
he royaly quesion open"
"Wasn' ha foolish o you?"
"I cerainly was Sill, you see,
1 didn' worry abou he money he
mill migh bing me hen I was he
resul of yearn of such selfdenial as
you could probably neer undersand,
aud 1 loed be hiug iself, aud only
waned o see i go Tbe direcors
ook adanage of be fac Perhaps,
one couldn' blame hem"
Ho sa silen awhile, and ho girl
noiced he sligh hardening of his
face
"Now," she said, "You wan o
enjoy he fruis of your labor!"
"Yes," said I'aisdale simply, and
fixed his eyes,whioh were ery seady,
full upon her "a I said, your lie
has— a good deal o offer me 1 hae
grown ery daring laely, een bold
enough ojiong for be appareiiiyjun
aaiuable"
gaha Leslie smiled, hough here
was a race of color In her face
"h," she said, "perhaps nohing is
really unaainable if one is bold
enough"
Then she rose and lef him as he
seel works secreary, immaculaely
groomed, came up He sa beside
Taisdale
"Wo are going o hae one of he
direcors down in a couple of weeks,
and 1 expec him o bring wo or
hree leading engineers o see your
mill," he said "We sball probably
gie a luncheon aud make i a kind of
a funcion You menioned a fresh
improemen How hae you been
geing on wih i?"
"1 almos hink i will^be ready
hen," said Taisdale wih he curi
ous lile smile, which had once or
wice since he made a oerain hard
bargain wih him caused be soureary
a ague uneasiness
In be meanime wo of Miss Leslie's
acquainances were discussing her,
aud one of hem glanced a Taisdale
as she said, "One naurally expecs
somehing eccenric from gaha,
bu s a rifle difficul o see why
she encourages ha man "
The oher girl laughed a lile "1
raher like Taisdale myself, lie is
refreshingly genuiue, and ime is
eomehlng ha suggess resered force
abou him which appeals o mo, aa 1
hink i does o gaha fer all,
be is quie prebenable,aud she hasn'
 penny, while men who inen hings
do ge rich occasionally '
"Tha," said her oompaniou,"would
cerainly no appeal o gahu She
could hae bad Haggle Naeeby, aud 1
beliee, wo ohers, who neer need
worry abou iueuiug machines"
Then she laughed, "a  maer of
fac, Keggie is quie iucapable o do
ing i, oi anyhing else, excep play
ennis aud dießa himsel asefully"
j'hey srolled away alking of Home
body else, while Talsdalo excused
himself presenly aud Bpeu ha een

wen bauk o bis oomorlesu rooms
aud ea up hal be nigh poiiug oer
a sheaf of drawings  lile glin
crep Ino his eyes whon a las he
laid hfim down
"The hing will go," he fiaid "The
direcnia will buy I, oo; bu I will
be bO my erms hin ime"
Thfiii lin ea sill for half nn hour
wih nn iiullghed pipe In bis hand,
while cerain rosene isions floaed
beforn him, The long lean years of
irugKle bad gone, and (hero opened

gian pounding hammers, and long
rows or grinding rolls lilled he big,
opon Bided shod Thero wus a smell
of burning grease and incandescen
iron, rails glowing bloodred clanged
along he Iron floors, be frockcoaed
direcors ami eminen engineers wih
he few dainily dresaerl women among

ou o plnce bero Thoy sopped be
fore a row of pondorous iron rolls
raugod in n series afer be fashion of
gian clobesmanglea wih a big silen

chairman of direcors urned o be
res
" ir Taisdalo's inenion is, 1

o smiled a he ohers geuially,
and Taisdale, who smiled, oo, in a
somewha curious fashion, glanced a
gaha Leslie
"1 urn glad you are here," be said
sofly "You were be firs o be gra
cious o me wbeu no ou of any kind
ness hese people ook mo up"
gaha Lesslie said nohing, bu a
ery fain ruco of color crep ino her
face She undersood wha be had
lef unsaid, and knew he mean ha
he was glad she was here o see bis
riumph
Then a masa of seel glowing incan
descn was sho from a ruck, and he
big engine paned when he raised bia
band Tbe ponderous rolls spun, and
seizing he glowing mass kneaded
flamo from i as hey drew n be
ween hem and cas i ou again,
longer and narrower han i bad beeu
This happened seeral imes, and hen
he rolls ook hold and kep i while
a hissing band of meal ha changed

I wrihed across he iron floors in
apparenly liing folds, a grea fiery
serpen wihou bead or ail and hen
rushed ino he jaws of a machine ha

afer he Urs few passes wih a guid
ing ool Tbe Taisdale mill did
eeryhing
"I's unique," said au eminen en
gineer "I suppose an ordinary mill
would no urn ou as much wih a
dozen men and boys Perbaps he
mos ingenious hing is bis auo
maic swiel guide ha pracically
does all be guiding"
Tbe secreary looked a Taisdale
"I is raber curious; 1 don' seem
o hae beard o i before Were hose
guides made in our fiing shop?"
"In Sheffield," said Taisdale dry
ly, "a my expense"
Then, while he grea men expressed
heir approal, be glanced a gaha
Leslie, and saw comprehension in her
eyes Thia waa par, a leas, o he
reward he had oiled for, and he girl
fel a hrill run hrough her, for i
seemed ha she had her share in he
man's achieemen She was glad ha
she bad been gracious o him when he
firs, in bis own reseed fashion, which
was raber proud han diffiden, passed
be grudgingly opened gaes of her
own world She bad seen ha he was
a man wih a gif hen, and now be
commens of hose famous in bis pro
fession bad proed her belief in him
warraned Slio bad also,a lile laer,
seen somehing else, and knew why
be aended funcions which could
hae no charm fur him Nor did ha
displease her She had had admirers
who could dance and play ennis
well, bu hey, for he mos par,
could do nohing else, while his man
could handle ho gian forces o ire
aud seam aud shoulder bis way up
ward, wih be world and all is piej
udlces agains him
"1 should like o wach be rolls a
lile nearer," she said
Taisdale nodded "Well," he mild,
simply, "1 know you are no afraid"
Onoo more he engine pounded, aud
be blssiug, whieho Beel leap from
he rolls I swung ou behind be
wo who sood neaes, while be res
drew back, a grea glowing baud ha
clanged horribly aud aruok red sparks
hum be resounding lrou doors, and
he girl fel her beui bea a rifle
fuser an she realized ha hey were
bloue wihin he engirdling of be
iiery seel HUH, ebe showed no Blgu
of i aa who wached be uau wih
eoulidenne in her bigoahu eyes They
were ery like bia owu jus bon,
grae and seady, eyes ha would no
waer when hey looked a crisis in
he face
Then here was a sudden sriden
ringing, a crash, and a shower of
sparks, and one ecu! of he Blowing
band held fas while be slack of i
closed In on hem Ho far aa gaha
could see, here was only a lile
pioed roller o preen hem being
sawn In wo ibe also saw ho man
who droe be big engine suddenly
grasp a leer, aud hen glauco a Ta
imhilo, who made a lile sign Home
body behind hem shoued in alarm,
here waa a claer of running work
men's fee, and be secreary's oice
came hrough he roar of be grinding
rollH Tuiadale flnshed a glauoo a
his companion, and his oice, which
she beard fainly, bad a curious ring
"if I pull be engine up I'm going
o hae rouble How much do you
rus mo?" ho said
I was only or a ruomeu she me his
eyofl, bu she knew all ho mean
Tbero was in hem he ague con
emp o ho oiler for be class sbe
sprang from, a class immuno from be
hazards be rank and file mus run;
ho disrus which had, howeer,
made an excepion of her; and he
demand for an equal courage in he
woman he bad chosen as his mae
She knew ha he had chosen her,
and she would much her srengh
wih his, pride of ealou wih pride
of manhood She flung up her head
wih a lile laugh ha reaohed him
hrough he rumbling of he mill
"re you afraid o pu me o be
es," she said
Taisdale said nohing, bu he signed
again o he emgneor, while be dark
blood crep ino bis fane, and ho girl
caugh her breah as be grea ma
chine pounded faser, and he iiory
band ran in on hem She neer quie
forgo ha momen, for a'l her con
fidence in be man Then here was
anoher harsh crackling and a blaze
of sparks; and be band, relaxing
once more, recoiled wide behind hem
on be floors They sood wihin is
bloodred loops unharmed, unil he
las of i anished wih a crash Then
ery quiely Taisdale urned o herPersonal
"I'bank you!" he said "1 do no
hink any man or woman has eer
shown so much faih in me before
Sill, here was no danger— 1 had
guarded agains such an emergency,
before he hem of your dress was
singed 1 would hae wrecked he
mill"
Then he ohers clusered abou hem
wih quesions and congraulaions on
heir escape, and gaha Leslie sood
silen, a lile paler ban usual, bu
wih a gleam in her eyes, while Tais
dale explained how he had proided
agains any disaser resuling from a
premaure cooling of he seel
Tbe eminen engineer once more
nodded approingly
"The plan," he said, "is, a leas,
aa elHoien in operaion as i Is bold
in concepion"
The direcor, howeer, looked a
Miss Leslie wih a lile smile
"There are," he said, "women who
migh eny your neres"
Taisdale now said nohing a all
He sooped down and quiely
somehing o a sandard wih a pi
oed wheel on i ha rose from an
opening in he iron floor, bu when
some weny minues laer be sa face
o face wib he man who ruled ha
grea concern he epoke a few ery
plain words ersely, and be secreary
found i difficul o check a lile
gasp of asonishmen and anger
"Bu we bough up all your paen,
and all is righs!" he said
"You did," said Taisdale grimly
"Tha is, one of hem I know now
ha here are people in Sheffield who
would hae gien me four imes as
much as you did, and you are naur
ally aware o i There are, howeer,
wo paens, and he one you did no
buy can be used wihou be oher,
while you can easily esimae wha
i will cos^you on eery on of suff
you roll 1 hae, beeu asked o sell i
o he Shelneld people lhough i
does no affec he quesion, I may
poin ou ha if you had gien me a
reasonable share of be profi of my
inenion 1 migh hae been conen
wib be plan as s, and no hae
worried oer i unil be second no
ion occurred o me"
Tbe direcor made a lile sign "In
be firs place," he said quiely,
"migh one ask wha you expec o
ge for i?"
"Tha is my idea," and Taiadale
smiled as he laid a papei on he able,
bu here was consernaion and dis
gus in he secreary's faoe as he
glanced a i
"I is a preposerous demand," he
aaid, and raised his brows ironioally
"You eidenly considered i neces
sary o pu n wriing"
"1 almos hink i was wiser," said
Taledale, wib a lile dry smile
"You may, perbaps, remember here
waa a hulfdefluie uaaiuaico made me

There whs b fow mlnnea alienee,
mifl hen he glanced n he secreary
wih a lile winkle in his keen old
eyes
"I don' hink we nhall gain any
hing by rying o break Mr laisdnle

Talfdnle nodded "1 should, 1 ' he
