ROPES AS FIRE ESCAPES
An Experience Which Shook One
Mnii'n Confidence In Them
"Yes, I know that most of the boys
carry a rope around with 'em," said
the commercial traeler, "and the time
was when I would not hae taken the
road without one, but I gae mine to
my wife for an extra clothesline three
or four years ago I read occasionally
of a rope saing somebody from a
turning hotel, but I don't care to be
saed that way"
"But you don't want to be burned
with the hotel, do you?" was asked
"Of course not, but if I can't get
down by the stairs or the iron fire
escape I'll take my chances on a mat
tress or a firemen's ladder"
"But what's the matter with a knot
ted rope?" Personal >Personal
, "I didn't think anything was the
matter for many years I used to go
to bed feeling as safe as'a baby in
his crib, and if I found a traeler who
didn't carry a fifty foot rope in his grip
I set him down as a ery reckless man
One day when I was in an Indiana
town a lot of us got to talking about
ropes and burning hotels, and a wall
eyed bluffer offered to bet me $5 to $1
that I couldn't slide down my ' rope
from a third story window and not
half kill myself Of course I jumped
at the bet, but he knew what he was
talking about I hadn't lowered my
self six feet before the rope burned
my hands and I let go and broke a leg
The  trick was tried by three \ others
and though they escaped broken bones
they were badly shaken up and tongue
bitten After my leg mended I bluffed
eerybody I met on that rope business,
and I neer found a chap who could
slide down two stories and feel good
for a month after A sailor could do
it, of course', but I'm no sailor, and if
eer I'm cut off by fire I'll take a head

PAPERING THE PINS
An Insenions Operation That Is Per
formed by Machinery
The first plus made in this country
were ery crude indeed, merel}' a bit
of wire twisted into a knot for a head
at one end and sharpened to a point at
the other Their successors of today
undergo a surprising ariety of opera
tions before they are considered fit for
use ""
In comparison with the size of the
object manufactured the operations
seem bewilderlngly numerous, but If
there be one process more remarkable
than another it is "papering the pins"
The papers, haing been passed
through an ingenious machine which,
at regular Interals, according to the
size of the pin, pinches up a fold and
pricks a hole In it, are ready to receie
the pins
For this purpose there is another ma
chine, worked by two children One
feeds the pins, the other the papers
The first part of the machine is a box
about twele inches long, six broad and
four deep The bottom is composed of
small square steel bars, sufficiently far
apart to let the shank of the pin fall
through, but not the head These bars
are Just as thick as the space between
papered pins The lower part of the
bottom of the box Is made to detach it
self as soon as the row of pins is com
plete" Row after row, at regular in
terals, Is receied and passed down a
corresponding set of grooes until it
reaches the ready pricked paper By
the nicest possible adjustment these
pins come exactly to their places and
are pressed into them By this method
two little girls can in one day put up
many thousands of papers— Kansas

WISE MEN'S MISTAKES
Some of tht; Queer Blunders Made
by Fnmnua Writers
Now and then one meets with pas
sages in the works of the most cele
brated authors which display an ig
norance of things that eery schoolboy
is supposed to know
Sir Walter Scott in his "Heart of
Midlothian" speaks of j his heroine as
haing "the merit of those peacemak
rrs to whom It is pronounced as a
benediction that 1! •?> s'lall infterit tiit
earth" Born and bred and passing
his life In Bible reading Scotland, Sir
Walter wns yet ignorant of the fact
that it was to the meek that the in
heritance of the earth was promised,
and the benediction of the peacemakers
was that "they shall ba called the chil
dren of God"
ickens in his "Tale of Two Cities"
says "the name of ths strong man of
old Scripture descended to the chief
functionary who worked the guillo
tine" One does not hae tobe a pro
found student of the French reolution
to knoi that the notorious executioner
who chopped off heads in the Place ile
la Reolution was named Sanson and
not Samson ''/ ;;
The lowest pupil in the lowest class
in history in the public schools knows
that it was Balboa who discoered the
Pacific ocean, yet Keats in his im
mortal sonnet "On First Looking Into
Chapman's Homer" makes Cortes the
man who stood "silent upon a peak in
arien" nnd saw the great "south sea"
stretching away before him
The great Gibbon, who was so intol
erant of the errors of other men,
speaks in his "Roman Empire" of "the
Oxus and the Jaxartes, two riers of
ancient renown which descend from
the mountains of India toward the
Caspian sea" Yet eery school geog
raphy shows that the two riers flow
into the sea of Aral, and the Jaxartes
most certainly rises In no "mountains
of India" ' 
Shakespeare wrote of "the coast of
Bohemia," and in his "Gertrude of
Wyoming" Campbell had tigers prowl
ing through the jungles of Pennsyla
nia! Such "ignorance in high places"
cannot be excused, for, with ordinary
ease, Gibbon, Shakespeare and Camp
bell could hae ascertained the facts

JOCKEYS IN TRAINING
KEEPING THE WEIGHT OWN IS NOT
A IFFICULT PROBLEM
Fattening; Foods Are Aoided, and
Judicious Exercise Is~ Courted— As
a Rule, Riders Last a oien Years
and as a Class Are Not Saing
is a popular belief," a well known
trainer said to a reporter recently,
"that a jockey has to resort to all sorts
Of injurious practices in order, to keep
Us weight within required limits The
idea, howeer, is a far stretched one
Of course a jockey has to go through
certain exercises each day and has to
be ery much more careful regarding
what he puts in his stomach than moat
people in order to keep his weight down
a&Vfrpm' acquiring a superfluity of
ttesh, but he certainly does not stare
himself, as is generally supposed If
be did so he would break down entirely
In a ery short time A jockey must
also be in the best possible physical
trim and hae his wits about him be
fore a race, and to attain that he must
be careful how he uses his constitution
"There are two ery important things
a jockey has to consider in studying his
dietary He must see to it that his food
is of the best quality and that it con
tains practically no flesh forming prop
erties All such fattening foods as, for
Instance, soups, beef, pork,' potatoes,
puddings and pastries a jockey must
deny  himself Coffee,  tea or other
drinks are only taken ery moderately,
as all liquids help more or 'less in put
ting on flesh
"Although a jockey has to eschew
such foods, there are many other arie
ties which' he gets just as much pleas
ure in eating and which at the same
time are equally as good and strength
ening for his constitution A few days
before a race a jockey who has a
mount in it will not stint himself—pro
ided he has no fear of oerlapping
his proper weight for the race— ln any
thing which he thinks will not inter
fere with his digestie apparatus
"Some jockeys, of course, take on
and lose flesh quicker than others I
hae known one or two who were par
ticularly anxious to ride In certain
races, but for which they were perhaps
as much as eight or nine pounds too
heay, who reduced that weight in the
same number of days To accomplish
that, howeer, they hae to resort prac
tically to a 'staring diet,' leaing as
little as the strain on the itality will
permit without breaking down and try
Ing to reduce their oerweight by cer
tain sweating exercises It is needless
to say that no jockey could stand too
frequent repetitions of such seere
measures to subtract from his weight
without danger of permanently injur
ing his health and een sacrificing his
life; still, many willingly resort to such
'get light weight quick' methods where
they see good opportunities of making
a name or a pile of money for them
seles
"It must be remembered that by na
ture Jockeys as a whole are not of sub
stantial physique or imposing in height,
although they are as tough as whlp
cosd If they were, therefore, to in
dulge eery day in the heay bill of
fare that the aerage business or work
ing man partakes of It Is not probable
that they would Increase much in
weight or height You often see jock
eys in the big hotels and restaurants
at the arious racing sections after a
race tucking in big and expensie din
ners with a gusto and relish that
would gie a chronic dyspeptic an ap
petite for hard tack
"Walking, running, cycling, punching
the bag and hurdle jumping are faor
ite exercises among jockeys to keep
their weight down On going out for
a walk or run they wrap themseles in
the thickest of woolen sweaters and
other heay clothing, no matter how
high the temperature may be, and the
exercise Is kept up for a distance per
haps of eight or nine miles, or, as we
say, until you are 'drowned in sweat'
Turkish baths are also frequently in
dulged In by many, and they must
wear excessiely warm clothing after,
and also when going for a gallop, no
matter if the weather be boiling hot
"I should say that ten or twele
years Is the aerage of a jockey's ac
tie turf life The length of his career,
howeer, depends a great deal on his
riding ability and luck
"Jockeys are not of a saing class,
and with but few exceptions I know
of none who has eer managed to put
enough money away to keep him in
een half decent comfort after retiring
from the turf The majority, howeer,
succeed in scraping up a bank roll of
sufficient dimensions to start In some
business Like retired pugilists,' they
hae a fondness J for the liquor  busi
ness, and I know a few one time Jock
eys who are prospering in that trade in
different parts of the country Others,
again, become 'bookies,' poolroom keep
ers and enter into such' businesses as
enable them to gratify their Ineterate
loe for gambling • I know "of only one
exJockey who Is an exception to this
rule He retired some years ago with
$60,000 to his credit, and he immedi
ately went into the real estate business
in New Jersey Today he is doing well
He was fortunate enough, howeer, to
receie a good common school educa
tion in his early boyhood days— and
that's a thing jockeys ery rarely get
Outside of their knowledge of horse
manship the great majority are as
ignorant as red Indians"— New York

CARE FOR SLEEPERS
A CLUB WHERE OZING MEMBERS
ARE NEVER ISTURBE
There Is a Good Reason For This
Custom, Which Is' Not Allowed to
Be Violated— A Short Sleep Which
' Culminated In a Tragedy
There is an exclusie club in upper
New York where the employees are for
bidden from awakening any member
who drops asleep in his chair in the li
brary or sitting room If a' isitor in
quires for him he Is "out" Other mem
bers, if they see him, carry on their
conersation In low tones or go' to the
smoking room or cafe Very few new
members are admitted to the club, but
those who are fortunate enough to get
in or those who bring isitors are re
minded of this custom
A physician who belongs to the club
explained the reason of it "It is
wrong  under any circumstances," he
said, "to awaken a man who has fallen
into a natural sleep How do you
know but it Is the first time he has
been able to sleep for hours or een
days? This phenomenon of sleep is a
ery complicated one There are many
grades of sleep, and they affect differ
ent men in different ways reams
are the result of defectie or partial
sleep, and their y common occurrence
in the lighter arieties of the state
shows that the rest taken by most per
sons is not profound or continuous
een while it lasts '
"on't you know that scores of per
sons in New York take a long trolley
ride in the eening simply to produce
a feeling of sleepiness? If a man lookß
straight ahead of him or reads a news
paper his ride will do him little good
He might as well remain at home on
his front stoop But If he looks about
him, constantly shifting his gaze from
one scene to another, be gets into a
state of drowsiness such as is brought
about by artificial means when It Is
called hypnotism That is why bo
many men feel like dozing in the club
after they come In from a ride or a
drie in the park
"Sleep Induced by oereating is not
natural That brought about by stimu
lants is nothing but blood poisoning
and stupor It may be desirable and
een necessary in some cases to pro
duce this stupor But the state Into
which the brain is thrown is not sleep
If natural sleep follows, it Is a con
tingency and not the effect of the
stimulant But I was going to tell
you a story, not delier a medical lec
ture I must not mention names, but
many old club men of New York will
remember the tragedy
"There was a man who was quite
prominent, both in a business and so
cial way, In the life of this city A
dreadful family misfortune brought on
Insomnia He would sometimes go
fortyelght hours without sleep; then
after a normal night or two he would
not be able to sleep for a week All
his life until his trouble 'came upon
him he bad been habitually a heay
sleeper After two or three months of
this insomnia attack his health began
to gie way Physicians tried all the
usual means of oercoming the diffi
culty, but failed He was prescribed
sleeping drafts until 'it became dan
gerous to continue them longer Personal 
"Then he went to Europe, taking a
competent young physician of my ac
quaintance as companion Specialists
abroad prescribed walking and moun
tain climbing, but they discoered that
there is nothing to be gained by in
creasing the fatigue of the body when
worry of mind will not allow the re
pose to which the limbs are entitled
The man came home little the better
for his trip He retired from business
His strength wasted away
"Finally by one of those curious
freaks of nature we occasionally
caught him dozing at the club All
who knew his misfortune sympathised
with him We moed about as though
in a sick chamber until he awoke He
seldom slept more than twenty min
utes and told us that bis restlessness
at night continued One afternoon he
came in positiely drowsyPersonal To a friend
he saidPersonal
" 'I feel as though I could sleep for a
week, but I can't sleep in my own
home— no Find me a bed here'
"We got him upstairs to a room and
put a man on guard at the door, with
Instructions to see that no serant was
allowed to disturb him or make a noise
An hour or so afterward an accident
in the kitchen brought the fire engines
up to the door There was really no
danger, but before a ladder could be
raised poor Blank's body came tum
bling into the area
"He was killed Suicide? No It
was the opinion of all of us that sud
den awakening from the first sound
sleep he bad enjoyed for more than a
year upset his mind and that when he
was awakened by the noise he did not
realize where he was In a frenzy he
leaped from the window"— New York

STILL CARPING
Our cotemporaries continue to be
 flooded with a lot of stuff anert the
appeal of the justice's salary case to
the supreme court The shades of
Ceasar and Alexander hae been
appealed to in tbe frenzied effort to
stay further proceedings We pre
sume before the sluices are finally
exhausted, the rest of the worthies
of ancient history will be called upon
"to interpose in this high behalf II
the same tactics which hae been
resorted to in this salary matter bad
been tried in any other litigation,
they would hae called down upon
Personal the wouldbe obstructionists the con
demnation of an outraged public
The amazing part of it is, the jus
tices and constables are held up by
our cotemporaries and editors pro
tern as martyrs The superisors
will not pay them their fee bills, and
the auditor will not pay them sal
 aries, until he is satisfied by tbe de
cision of the highest judicial tribunal
 that be is justified in so doing
" Een if this were true — which it is
not, as the offer bas been made to
allow them their fees on account,
and the offer refused — they hae
themseles to blame for the plight
in which they are placed Were they
not in high glee when tbe salary bill
was before the legislature? Were
they not hand in gloe working for
its passage? It was common talk at
that time that its constitutionality
was a matter of serious doubt if tbe
present incumbents were made the
 beneficiaries of the measures But
notwithstanding this, they were
more than anxious to line up under
its questionable proisions Were'
there not at tbe time it was before
tbe lawmakers, petitions circulated
with the iew of booming it into
popularity, een in spite of its ap
parently contraband character
Were not articles published at that
time by its supporters urging that
the law be left in the hands of tbe
superisors, and not be taken to
the courts for interpretation? Tbe
methods that hae been following
since the mandamus proceedings
were started hae been op a par with
 these initiatory steps Eerything
had been done to create an im
pression that it is an act bordering
on treason to think of taking tbe
case to the supreme court To such
an extreme has the appeal been
fought, that a widespread suspicion
is creeping oer the public mind of
wheels working within wheels in this
program of hindrance Blunder has
succeeded blunder; folly piled on
folly to close up the pathway of ap
peal But all in ain The Alex
ander has not grown so great as to
be able to dictate absolutely tbe
policy of Amador county in such
matters The weakness and as
cillating course of the noappeal side,
is in striking contrast with the firm
and resolute stand of those whose
business it is to do what they can to
protect the public interests In the
face of a great deal that calls for
censure; in the preseuce of abuse
alike uncalled for and unmerited,
the one redeeming feature of this
comedy of errors is the fact that the
district attorney and county auditor
remain immoable as rock in place,
determined to carry the controersy
to the tribunal which has been insti
tuted specially for the ' final settle
ment of such questions
COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTEN
ANCE
Parents may not be aware that by
a law passed by the last legislature
the attendance of children between
the ages of 8 and 14 upon the public
school is made compulsory Eery
child is required to attend for at
least fie months durinjf the year,
and at least eighteen weeks of the
attendance must be consecutie
Any parent or guardian failing to
comply with this law is guilty of a
misdemeanor For the first offense
the penalty is not to exceed $10 fine
or imprisonment not exceeding fie
days A subsequent offense is pun
ishable by a fine not less than $10
nor more than $50, or imprisonment
not less than fie nor more than 25
days, or both It is the proince of
constables in their respectie town
ships to see that this law is complied
with The percentage of children
failing to take adantage of the
liberal education proided by the
state is large Our free school sys
tem — tbe most liberal and thorough
ouchsafed by any goernment — is
not appreciated as it should be It
is to correct the growing eil of
nonattendance that this stringent
law was passed

THE ISSUE EXPLAINE
As interested parties are doiug
their utmost to create a false im
pression regarding the issue inoled
in tbe township officers salary bill,
which is moing up to tbe supreme
court from this county, it is not out
of place to state the case plainly at
this time The idea is gien out
that justices and constables are be
ing unjustly denied any compensa
tion either under the old fee law or
tbe new salary bill, by the arbitrary
action of the auditor That they are
compelled, on account of his stand,
to either work for nothing, pending
the decision of the matter on appeal,
or resign their offices This is not
the case, and neer has been tbe
case Tt is nothing more than an
effort to awaken sympathy, and de j
ceie the public as regards tbe real
issue No one denies that the jus
tices and constables are entitled to
compensation; if not under the sal
ary law, they are still entitled to
pay under the fee system This ;is
conceded There is no dispute, on
this proposition, and any attempt to
sow a different impression is prompt
ed by ulterior moties A bill was
passed by the 'at legislature chang
ing the pay of township officers from
fees to a stated salary Bills of a
similar character bad been passed
for other counties it is truePersonal but as
far as we hae been able to ascertain
the constitutional proision pro
hibiting an increase ot compensa
tion of "any official during his term
of office," was respected in all of
them, and tbe act was made to take
effect at the commencement of the
next term But the bill boosting
the compensation of township offi
cers in Amador county took a dif
Terent course It was by the terms
of the bill itself made to take effect
immediately All tbe then existing
township officers, elected under an
entirely different schedule of com
peusation, were at once clamoring
to be taken in under its liberal folds
The bill itself was deliberately and
wilfully designed to 6et aside the
constitutional restriction bearing on
this question Had the adocates
of the bill been content with making
it applicable to the next official term,
no question would hae been raised
as to its alidity Tbe wisdom of
the law een then may hae been
doubted, but the constitutional ob
jection would not hae been raised
We enture to say that neither the
county auditor nor the district at
torney _ has the slightest personal
feeling in the matter They are both
as anxious for the justices and con
stables to get what they are legally
entitled to as those officers are them
seles The offer has been made
that their bills under the fee system
be allowed by the superisors as
heretofore, and paid by the treas
urer, pending the outcome of the ap
peal of this case If the auditor wins
on appeal, they would then hae re
ceied all they were entitled to; if
the township officers win out, they
would then be entitled to additional
pay sufficient to make up tbeamount
of salary due under the salary bill
Why this arrangement has not been
made we are unable to explain The
fault for its miscarriage does not
rest with the appellant side of this
controersy Realizing, howeer,
that the salary bill, with the "take
effect immediately" clause tacked
thereto, strikes down one of the
itally important proisions of the
state constitution, the auditor and
district attorney deem it their duty
under the solemnity of their official
oaths, and for the protection of tbe
county and their bondsmen, and in
fact of all parties concerned, to hae
the controersy soled by the higher
court That is all there is to it In
stead of wailing at the coun ty of
ficers for taking this course, the jus
tices and constables, and their
friends, ought to hail with satisfac
tion tbe prospect of a definite and
complete settlement of the points
inoled

It is a curious fact that with almost
eery generation the dinner hour has
undergone a change, the principal meal
of the day being eaten at different pe
riods, from 10 o'clock in the morning
until 10 o'clock at night The author
of "The Pleasures of the Table" points
out that In England 400 or 500 years
ago people took four meals—breakfast
at 7, dinner at 10, supper at 4 and li
ery at 8 In France in the thirteenth
century 9 In tbe morning was the din
ner hour; Henry VII dined at 11 In
Cromwell's time 1 o'clock had come to
be the fashionable hour and in Addl
son's day 2 o'clock, which gradually
was transformed into 4 Pope found
fault with Lady Suffolk for dining so
late as 4 Four and 5 continued to be the
popular dining hours among tbe aris
tocracy until the Becond decade of the
nineteenth century, when dinner was
further postponed, from which period
It bas steadily continued to encroach

THE TAX LEVY
The board of superisors has fixed
the tax ley for the current year at
$2 on the $100 While this is fie
cents in excess of the rate last year,
it is not so hitfb as was expected
seeral weeks ayo The increase is
attributable entirely to the jump of
18 cents in the state tax Two
things hae contributed to keep
down the ley, namely, first the
enormous increase of taxable prop
erty throughout the state, and the
furtfrer inflation of alues in many
counties by the arbitrary action of
the state board of equalizers; sec
ond, the increase of tbe county's
assessment roll as returned by the
county assessor In 1902 the assess
ment roll of Amador county was
$4,618,830; in 1903 the figures are
$4,916,533, or an increase of nearly
$300,000 Last year the total re
enue from property taxes, assuming
that all dues were collected, was in
round numbers $90,000, while this
year the amount is $98,000 The in
crease of $8000, howeer, is entirely
due to the raise of 18 cents in the
state rate as compared with last year
All the local funds show a slight
decrease of probable reenue when
compared with the ley of 1902, ex
cept the hospital and school fuuds,
both of which demand and are al
lowed enhanced reenue To show
the changes in the tax ley for the
arious purposes,"we herewith gie
for the sake of comparison, the rates
leied in 1902 and 1903, as followsPersonal
1902 " 1903
State 382 561
Current expense 60 519
Hospital 15 17
School 32 32
General road 358 33
Special road 14 io
Total $195 $200
To enable our readers to hae a
clear idea of the sum required for
tbe different funds, we submit the
following table showing the reenue
by, the tax ley for the seeral funds
for 1902 and 1903Personal
1902 1903

Schools 14,779 15,732
Roads 16,534 16,223
Special road  6,466 4,916
In the estimated needs for the en
suing year, upon which the rates
were fixed by the superisors, the
proposed change in the mode of com
pensating township officers, from
fees to salaries, does not figure  It
was calculated that the increased
expense, in the eent of the salary
idea preailing, would not affect the
forthcoming year, as the case in the
supreme court will hardly be decided
until far into next year This must
be born in mind If that expense
was a certainty to be reckoned with,
it would hae made a difference of
10 cents additional in the ley

FATAL ACCIENT
AT ZEILA MINE
Joseph Gregor Falls 700 Feet in the
Zeila Shaft — Gloom Cast Oer the
Whole Community at Tragic End
An accident which sent a thrill of
horror through the community hap
pened at the Zeila mine on Thursday
eening, causing the instantaneous
death of one of the oldest and most
efficient employes About 5 o'clock the
skip was ascending tho shaft, full of
employes who were through with their
day's work Among them was Jos
Gregor, shift boss and timberman
Gregor with two others was standing
on the edge of tho skip, holding on to
tho cable, while the *kip was filled with
employes This is the usual way of
lowering down or hoisting men from
the mine About half way up, on this
particular trip, it was noticed that
something was amiss with the bell wire
This wire is a small cable, about a
quarter of an Inch in diameter, and
composed of a number of strands of
small wires It is the only means of
communication between those in the
shaft and the engineer Een while in
the act of ascending the shaft it is pos
sible in case of emergency to signal to
the engineer by means of the bell wire
Aboe the 700 leel it was realized from
the amount of slack that the wire had
parted some distance aboe It became
at once a source of danger to those rid
ing on the skip While there is a
pliancy about the cable, there is also
sufficient stiffness about it to cause it
to remain in the shaft and coil up as
the skip continued to ascend" There
was the bell wire in the other compart
ment, but this was beyond reach
There is no doubt the unfortunate ic
tim realized the situation, and tried to
aert the disaster which followed
The precise way he lost his balance
and fell is not known lie was riding
on that side of the shaft where the
broken wire would cause tho most dan
ger Whether in trying to push the
slack wire away, or whether he en
deaored to escape by the centre brace,
we cannot say He was noticed to fall
backward, and disappear in the shaft
The shaft is an incline, oer 1300 feet
deep eath, or at least unconscious
ness, probably ensued before the ictim
had fallen many feet The body went
Into the sump, which contained con
siderable water The skip was lowered
as soon as possible Some articles of
clothing belonging to deceased were
found at the 900 leel The work of
un watering the sump was prosecuted
with all possible speed, and about nine
o'clock tho body was recoered The
news of the sad eent spread oer the
town in a few minutes, and at the time
the body was brought to the surface, a
crowd of people, estimated at seeral
hundred, gathered at the mouth of the
shaft, mournfully watching the pro
ceedings The remains were mutilated
sadly, especially about the head They
wore taken to tho deceased's residence
on Stump street, near Marre's hotel
eceased was 39 years of age, a natie
of England He leaes awife and two
children, the oldest a girl of ten years,
the other a boy fie years old Mrs
Gregor was distracted with grief when
the terrible news was broken to her
For some time she was hysterical
eceased had been working at the
Zeila for oer sixteen years He was
an expert workman, and one of the
trusted employes of the company He
was moreoer uniersally esteemed by
his fellow workmen His untimely and
tragic end has cast a gloom oer the
community such as has not been ex
perienced for years
Coroner Huberty is holding an in
quest this aflornoou as we go to press
The jurors were out this morning to
iew the body, and also at the mine
Some of them went down the shaft and
examined tho bell wire To all out
ward appearance the wire was sound,
and its defectie character could not
be detected until reealed by a break
The funeral is announced to take
place tomorrow afternoon eceased
was a member of tho K of P and A
O U W organizations He was also
a member of Jackson Miners' Union,
W P of M, of which organization he
was elected a trustee at the electioq
held last month

Superintendent Riddick Resigns
The San Francisco Chronicle says
that J B Riddick, who for the past
four years has filled the responsible
position of superintendent of the
Preston Reform school at lone, has
sent in his resignation, to take effect in
ecember next With many who de
sire the welfare of this institution, this
action on the part of the superintend
ent will be regretted The place is an
arduous one; not eery good man can
manage a reformatory of this kind with
credit It must be admitted that under
r Riddick's care the school has been
free from the rumors of scandal and
mismanagement that hao marked it
in preious years The boys hae been
contented and happy; tho attempts to
escape hae been few That he has
not pleased eerybody is not to be
wondered at That feat is beyond the
reach of human accomplishment Pub
lic interests will be well sered if his
successor proes as capable and efficient
in tho management of the school as the
retiring superintendent has proed
himself

Burned by A Lie Wire
This morning, about 10 o'clock, Jas
M Stamps, employed as a lineman by
tho Standard Electric Company, was
seerely and perhaps fatally burned by
coming in contact with a lie wire As
far as we can learn from the meager
particulars receied, the ictim was en
gaged in soldering, and came in con*
taot with a lie wire carrying 2000
yolts He was terribly burned about
the arm and leg and one side r
Endicott repaired to the scene We
learn that the ictim will be taken to
the city today for treatment Hiscaso
is a critical one, and recoery is doubt
ful Stamps is a single man, about 30
years of age, and has been in the employ
of the Standard Company for about
three years

The Re r Phelps, the newly ap
pointed pastor of the M E church, for
the past throe years has had charge of
the church at Reno, Neada That he
ha 3 gien the utmost satisfaction in
that field is einced by the flattering
testimonials he has receied not only
from the press but from Indiidual
members of the church The Reno
Gazette of Sept 6, speaking of the re
gentleman's departure from that place
saysPersonal
"Under the administration of r
Phelps the Methodist church has had
an era of the greatest prosperity and
upbuilding
In this short time oer two hundred
hae been taken into the church— the
membership more than doubled The
parish has been in perfect harmony at
all times, as the healthy financial con
dition will indicate
uring the pastorage of r Phelps,
funds to the amount of $8000 hae been
raised in the parish, and the last year's
funds alone amounted to $3,27750
r Phelp's earnest work has been far
reaching, and the results of his efforts
can neer be defaced r»5"S
Especially among' the younger mem
bers of his church he has created a de
sire for adancement in the church
work The Junior League has a mem
bership of thirtyseen, the Boys' Club
has thirtytwo members, and the Ep
worth League has a membership of one
hundred enthusiastic members  • i
r Phelps seemed to hae many re
grets at leaing the people he has
labored among for the past three years,
but for domestic reasons he has decided
to go"

What Legal Methods Applied to Mcd
leal Practice Would Uncoer
"Now that I am through with medi
cine 1 can speak of the profession in a
fashion that I would not if I was still
in the practice," said a gentleman who
has been known as a successful physi
cian in Xew York for years as he sal
at luncheon in toe Lawyers' club
"Of course I don't care to hae my
name mentioned, for I hae lots of good
friends in the profession, but the fact
Is that the profession of medicine would
be nearly ruined if it had to be con
ducted aR you gentlemen of the bar
practice your calling
"We hae a great adantage oer
you, for you in your cases are subject
ed to the extremest publicity, while we
in our cases hae the utmost conceal
ment Just suppose that in our cases
we had a judge who knew as much as
or more than we did presiding oer our
actions and, worse than that, had an
other physician, whose interests were
not ours, watching and criticising us
at eery step and blazoning eery er
ror that we made ear me, such a
prospect as that would frighten the
best physician who eer lied the mo
ment he entered a sick, room, and yet
that condition is just what you men
of the law hae to face in eery caw
that you try Personal;' ; Personal 
"What sort of a figure would a law
yer cut floundering around in court
without any knowledge of his case?
But a physician can flounder mentally
In a sick room without a second person
being the wiser, though the patient
may suffer; but, then, 'dead men tell
no tales'
"Under such circumstances of doubt
which is usually ignorance, the physi
cian can look wise, put something Into
the patient's stomach, go to his office,
decide what line of experiment he will
follow, return the next day, hoping to
find that nature is working the cur
that he doesn't know how to effect, and
being ready and willing to take all of
the credit that comes his way
"Why, the ery first thing that nurses
are taught is to obsere the utmost se
crecy about doctors' blunders If they
told what they know there wouldn't be
much confidence in physicians where
they are heard Ask a nurse of expe
rience about this when you hae the
opportunity
"Yes, sir, I repeat that the publicity
and chance for criticism in your pro
fession, if applied to medicine, would
result in the discoery of a small
amount of science  as compared with
the large amount of empiricism"— New

SAFE OPENING TOOLS
Implements of Which Burglars Ser
er Een Get a Glimpse
"We hae tools for opening safes,"
said the foreman of the machine room
of a safe factory, "that no burglar
could Imitate een if he got them But
it would be one of the most difficult
things in the world for him to get een
a sight of them The tool room is
guarded as closely as a bank ault A
watchman stays in it all night We are
Tery careful about employing our men
They must gie bonds and hae the
best of references The chance of a
burglar getting into our employ for the
purpose of learning our methods is
scarcely worth thinking about
"Very frequently we hae hurry calls
for a man to open a safe where the
time clock has gone askew or where the
clerk has forgotten the combination
You can readily imagine that with a
bank or trust company it is an essen
tial thing to hae the safe open before
business begins When we send a
man out he takes a wagon load of tools,
for he must open the safe without ruin
ing the lock, and he does not know pre
cisely what the trouble is He carries
a photograph of himself with our cre
dentials on it Nor will he open the
safe while alone Some bank official
must remain with him, no matter how
long the job takes That is for our own
protection Some ery queer alleged
robberies hae been charged to men
sent out to open safes 
"To mechanics in our business it is
laughable to read that a full kit of bur
glars' tools has been found beside a
safe As I hae said, it would require
an express wagon to carry them, and
burglars don't work that way If they
care to take chances by blowing up a
safe with dynamite it is another mat
ter; but those fellows nearly always
get caught 
"A police officer told me that burglars
make their own tools The big crooks
are all spotted and are afraid to go out
and buy the material for them Some
of them send their wies and children"
—Philadelphia Ledger
POULTRY POINTERS
The best way to feed corn to young
chickens is cracked or crushed
A good dust bath will go far toward
keeping fowls in good condition
Clear, raw corn meal wet with water
is not a good feed for young ducklings
at any time
estroy the nest of a sitting hen as
soon as the chickens are a day old
Gie her a new nest and burn the old
one
Separated early and raised up by
themseles, pullets are worth at least
25 per cent more for use than if al
lowed to run with a lot of cockerels
On the farm if more than one breed
is kept it is necessary that they be
kept separate, and one or the other
must be kept confined part of the time
It is important to keep the young
turkeys dry until they are about eight
weeks old, and een then they should
be strong and well deeloped amp
ness is almost always fatal to young
turkeys
Religions Training; of Japanese
Little or no importance is attached
to the religious training of Japanese
children Whether the parents be
Buddhists or Shintoists it matters not,
for in either case the children rarely
take any part in the religious life of
their parents or elders, and indeed
usually grow up in blissful ignorance
as to what it is all about True, they
may occasionally be taken to the tem
ple and taught torub their palms to
gether, clap thrice and incline their
heads toward the shrine as they tons
their offering of rin through the wood
en grating of the huge money till
They may hae some ague notion
that there is something meritorious in
all this, but nothing more, although
eery ' Japanese home has a latticed
niche, or kamidana, dedicated to the
serice of the household Lares and
Penates, or alkoku and Eblsu as they
appear in Japan
No Reptiles In Newfoundland
Eerybody knows that there are no
snakes in Ireland, but ery few know
that Newfoundland is just like Ireland
in that respect, and there is no record
that Newfoundland had a St Patrick
to drie the snakes off either There
Is plenty of game in Newfoundland,
but not a reptile of any kind — snake,
toad, frog, lizard or een turtle An
other queer thing about the proince is
that while some wild animals are
abundant there no one eer saw a
squirrel, porcupine, mouse or lynx any
where within its boundaries This is
all the more singular because the ad
joining proinces of Noa Scotia and
Cape Breton hae all these animals
and many kinds of snakes and other
reptiles

YELLOWSTONE CANYON
At First Its Blsness and Barbaric

Imagine, if you can— but you neer
can— a mighty cleft in the leel earth
a third of a mile wide, its brinks sharp,
precipitous, reaching oer 1,200 feet
downward, sometimes almost perpen
dicular, sometimes banked with huge
heaps of talus or buttressed with spin
dling pinnacles and towers often sur
mounted wfth eagle nests, and all
painted, glowing with the richest color
—ast patches of yellow and orange,
Btreaklngs of red and blue, with here
a towering abutment of red and there
another all of yellow At the bottom
flows the gleaming green rier, and at
the top the dark green forest reaches
to the canyon edge, and sometimes
een rugged and gnarled pines, the an
guard of the wrri, enture oer the
precipice to find footing on some ledge
or to hang, half dislodged, with angular,
dead arms reaching out into the mighty
depths, a resting place for soaring

yon being  not of solid rock, but of
crumbling, soft formation, hae fur
nished plastic material for the sculp
turing of water and wind, which hae
tooled them into a thousand fantastic
forms One's eye traces out gigantic
castles, huge dog forms, bird forms, ti
tanic faces— all adding to the awful im
pressieness of the place
For miles the canyon stretches north
ward from the lower falls From
numerous well guarded outlooks the
spectator, grasping hard upon the rail
ing lest the dizziness of these heights
unnere him, may behold a hundred
aried iews of the grandeur, looking
either toward the falls, which seem to
fill the canyon end like a splendid white
colunin of marble, or off to the north
ward, where the stupendous gorge
widens out, loses some of its coloring,
admits more of the forest and finally
disappears among rugged mountains
Eerywhere the iew is one that
places the seal of awed silence upon the
lips It neer palls, neer grows old
One soon sees all too much of geyser
and paint pot; of this, neer At first
the sensation of saage immensity is
bo oerpowering that the spectator
gathers only, a confused sense of big
ness and barbaric color, but when he
has made the perilous descent to the
canyon bottom below the falls, when
he has seen the wonder from eery
point of iew, he begins to grasp a
larger part of the whole scene, to form
a picture which will remain with him
