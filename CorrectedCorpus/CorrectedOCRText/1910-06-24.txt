those certain mines in Plymouth min
ing district known as Bay State mine ;

Printed Envelopes
The appropriation bill for the year
ending June 30, 1911, contains the fol
lowing clause in regard to the printing
of envelopes with the address of firms
or individual's name thereon, a prac
tice which has been going on for over
forty years, to the detriment of print
ing offices throughout the country, and
with no corresponding benefit to the
government.
For manufacture of stamped envel
opes and newspaper wrappers, one
million four hundred thousand dollars :
Provided, that no part of the forego
ing sum shall be used to print or have
printed, or sell or offer to sell any
stamped envelope bearing upon it a
printed direction giving the name of
any individual, firm or company, or
any number of any post-office box or
drawer, or any street number or the
name of any building to which it shall
be returned if uncalled for or unde
livered: Provided further, that this
shall not apply to those envelopes
printed with a return card left blank
as to name, address, box, drawer,
street number, or building, and which
only give the name of the town or
city, with the state, district, or terri
tory : And provided further, that this
provision shall in no way interfere
with or prevent the carrying out of
any existing contract heretofore en
tered into by the government relative
to the printing and manufacture of en-
"It cured me. or "It saved the life of
my child," are the expressions you
hear every day about Chamberlain's
colic, cholera and diarrhoea remedy.
This is true the world over where this
valuable remedy lias been introduced.
No other medicine in use for diarrhoea
or bowel complaints has received such
general approval. The secret of the
success of Chamberlain's colic, cholera
and diarrhoea remedy is that it cures.
