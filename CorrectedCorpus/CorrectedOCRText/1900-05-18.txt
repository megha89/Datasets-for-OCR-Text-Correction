IRRIGATION IS INVESTIGATED
Water Necessary for. Crop
Production.
TESTS fIT THE WYOMING EXPERIMENT STATION
Storage Beservoire Are Needed.—Sec
retary of Agriculture Sends- Out
Bulletins.
The Department of Agriculture has
in press an interesting bulletin' pre
pared by Prof. B. C. Buffura, showing
the results of his irrigation experi
ments for the past nine years : at the
Laramie,- Wyoming Experiment sta
tion.
Professor Buffum states that the
time has now arrived when- many irri
gated districts have so far developed
that scarcity of water is keenly felt,
and the good of* the community de
mands that there shall be no unneces
sary waste of the limited supply. The
knowledge lacking in irrigation, and
which must in some way be obtained
before our water supply will be either
wisely or correctly, used, is how much
water is required to secure the best re
sults, and when and by what moans it
can be most economically and efficiently
applied. ■ j | \ '■
Some of the experiment* have been
made with a view to determining the
effect of the use of a jrreator or less
quantity of water upon tins crop re
turn of a given area. Profeesor Buffum
presents tables showing the crop re
turns from various plants on which
different quantities of water were used,
but they are not conclusive and more
experiments are needed. In general,
however, the tables show larger yields
where the larger quantities of water
were used, but the increased yields are
not in proportion to the increased
quantities of water used. The varying
conditions affecting the quantity of
water needed by crops are fully dis
cussed in the bulletin. Most plants
cultivated in the arid West were intro
duced from more humid regions, and
not economical in their water require
ments. Selections of drought-resisting
varieties may make - possible a great
extension of the present irrigated area.
Methods, too, of cultivation and-irri
gation have much to do with the quan
tity of water used. Flooding as a- rule
requires more water than irrigating in
furrows, and it has been observed that
grass and grain, which are usually irri
gated by flooding, produce more thrifty
growth on ditch banks and higher
ridges and knolls where the roots are
supplied from beneath rather than
from the surface. This fact has led in
some localities to the adoption of the
rill system with such crops as cover all
the land.
The Laramie river is a type of many
of the western rivere whose waters are
used for irrigation. Professor Buff urn's
tables and diagrams show that the
river furnishes the greatest supply of
water in May and the early part of
June, and that all crops except native
hay require the most water later in the
season — the latter half of June and the
first hall of July. This means that
irrigated farming along the Laramie
river must be limited to native hay
and the small area of other crops
which can be irrigated with the sum
mer flow of the river, unless the spring
floods are stored for the use of those
crops requiring later water. In
Wyoming this is not so great a hard
ship as a like condition would be in
some other States. The fact that the
greater part of the land in that State
is beyond the reach of water makes
stock raising the leading industry of
the State, and the great need of thsit
industry is winter feed for the stock
which runs on the open range during
the summer months. But native hay
is a light crop, even when irrigated
and storage reservoirs would make it
possible to cultivate an increase of area
, of other forage crops which yield much
more heavily than native hay.
Professor Buffum emphasizes the
fact which is brought out by almost
every recent writer on irrigation, that
the present system of giving irrigators
title to the use of a continuous flow of
a stream of a given size is not neces
sary and fa moreover wasteful. He
shows that some systems 'of rotation
by which the owner of seventy acres
can have the use of a larger head than
one second-foot for short periods dur
ing the season will more pearly corre
spond in a great saving of water.
The bulletin can be obtained by ap
plying to the Secretary of Agriculture,
Geo. E. Mitchell.
The preservation of many of the
farms on the lowlands fa really depend
ent upon the forestization of the moun
tains and the irrigation of the arid
regions. As it fa now the water from
the melting snow and ice of Colorado
Rockies, instead of being stored where
it fa needed, sweeps dawn through the
arid region in rocky chan nels, washes
away farms in Kansas and Nobraska,
and breaks through levees in Mississippi
and Louisiana, causing (incalculable
damage to government and private
property and loss of human life.

Intensive Culture of Tomatoes.
Drive a 7-foot stako where the plant
is to grow. Then plant the seed or set
the young plant. The latter may
ripen first, but the seed plant will out
strip it in growth. Let nothing but
leaves grow below the first setting of
tomatoes. After you have one good
setting you may let the plant fork.
This gives two mainstems. Let no
more shoots grow until at least two
settings of tomatoes are formed on
each branch. Then let the vine fork
again. .Keep all shoots below all these
trimmed off, going over them carefully
once or twice a week. After September
1, or later in the South, cut off unspar
ingly all shoots or tops of main branch
es. You will find good big tomatoes at
the top of tho 6 feet of stake you have
above the ground.
As many as thirty-two good-sized
tomatoes have been counted on one
stalk after the bottom branch had
ripened and was" gone. Remember
that at the base of each leaf comes out
a branch. This stem is the one to
keep trimmed off. The blossom is on
the main stem. This leaf sprout will
sometimes come out again, and must
again be trimmed off. Only by severe
trimming are the best results obtained.
Should an early frost threaten, the
plant' thus staked can be protected
until mature with blankets. If not
staked it would probably coyer 10
square feet of space on the ground and
be lost. The flavor of the tomato is
far superior to those grown on the
ground. r-V. C. Turner, in Orange

Her Revenge.
A Germantown girl who usually gets

"but wb,ere's. the 'sent'?" "In the

Then everybody laughed, and the girl
who had been caught determined to

"What's the answer?" "Oh, it's

U. 8. Treasury Report.
March" 10, 1900, the TJ. §. Treasury
had on hand, as shown by the official
statement, a net cash balance of $301,
927,150.28. Government receipts, in
excess of all expenses, for seven months
prior to March Ist, were as follows:
August, 1899 $ 4,455,862.58
Sept., " 7,754,772.09
Oct., '• 3,359,561.82
Nov., " 6,175,724.68
Dec., " 7,613,555.91
Jan., 1900 8,823,068.00
Feb., " 7,892,792.89
Total .$46,075,335.97
This fa an average of $6,582,190.85
per month; or, . at the rate Qf $78,986,
290. JO per year.
In his letter to Congress, Jan. 10,
1900, the Secretary of the Treasury
said: "The revenues are now largely
exceeding disbursements frani month
to month, and seem likely to, do so for
an indefinite time, This condition
would be a menace to the business
world if assurances wore not given that
this surplus would be diverted from
the treasury vaults to the public de
positories where, while secure to the
Government, it would remain available
to public use."
The. eiisleuoe of over $300,000,000
cash in the Treasury means that the
Government not only has the required
Gold Reserve ($150,000,000, under the
law just passed), hut that it also has
on band mpre than $150,000,000 addi
tional, available for any possible emer
gency.
With this enormous sum on handj
what possible excuse can there be for
taxing the people 'sßo,ooo,ooo per an
num more than is needed to meet all
public expenses?
What possible excuse can there now
be for Congress refusing to repeal the
vexatious * and ' unjust 'stamp taxes
which harrass the druggists and the
manufacturers of medicinal prepara
tions, perfumery, etc.?
If the. entire tax levied under
"Schedule B" of the War Revenue
Act were repealed, the annual reduc
tion of revenue thereby effected would
not equal the surplus for a single
month. ,

Woman's medical adviser
Medical advice can only be given by a
medical man or woman; one educated
and trained in the profession of medicine.
IT IS USELESS TO WRITE
TO A WOMAN
or man for medical advice unless such
are trained and qualified medical practi-
tioners. Offers of " medical advice " are
made by those who cannot give what
they offer, because they lack the med-
ical training and professional qualifica-
tions of physicians. You will not trust
your property to the care of irresponsible
people. Will you trust your health?
Inquiry will show that no offer made by
any advertising physician can compare
with that of Dr. R. V. Pierce, chief con-
sulting physician to the Invalids' Hotel
and Surgical Institute, Buffalo, N. Y.
Bick women can consult Dr. Pierce by
letter free. All letters are read and an-
swered in strictest confidence. If you are

FRIDAY...  MAY 18, 1900
Without doubt the action of the Republican State Con
vention held last Tuesday in Sacramento was sound. It did
not run rampant in a declarator sense and slop over, as
some conventions have done, and as this one might have done
had not cool heads been at the helm. The National Conveu
■ tion will in due time make the platform for the National
party and then it will be time to voice party policy. The
convention performed its duties promptly and with very little
friction, electing^safe and sound Republicans to represent the
party in the National Convention at Philadelphia. We" may
feel assured that the delegates elected will zealously guard
the interests of California and maintain the dignity and
honor of the party'in every particular.
, The Ledger is under obligation to Hon. Marion De
Vries, member of Congress from this district, for a copy of
the United States Geological Report, recently issued, which
treats comprehensively of the subject of forest reserves in the
United States, and particularly of those of California. This
is a subject which is becoming of great interest to the people
of our State, and is one which will be of more importance in
the future. The work is a valuable acquisition to our library,
and we appreciate it as such. Mr. De Vries has also furnish
ed this office with a detailed statement of the national public
debt for which he also has our sincere thauks.
If certain daily papers of this State would desist from the
futile attempt to get the lancet into the Southern Pacific Co.,
and pay more attention to legitimate journalism, the political
atmosphere would be clearer and produce more ozone for
them. Unhealthy politics comes more from diseased would-
be leaders, whose ruling ambition is to either "rule or ruin,"
than from corporations whose main desire is to be let alone
so that they can attend to their own business. Corporations,
as a rule, do not meddle with politics until they are forced to
do so for self-protection.
Bryanites are uneasy because anti-Bryan democrats
are making a bold bluff about some great political surprise
they are going to spring at the Kansas City Convention.
Bryan will be nominated. This is a foregone 'conclusion.
The anti-Bryan ringleaders are evidently trying to scare
Bryan and his supporters into modifying the Chicago plat
form, especially the 16 to 1 plank.
Amador county carried off some of the honors at the
late Republican State Convention. James E. Dye is now a
member of the Republican State Central Committee and Will
A. Newcum is secretary of the Congressional Committee.
Hon. John F. Davis was on the ground and jpiloted these
gentlemen to places of honor.
Sutter Creek has two papers, the Amador County
Democrat having appeared Thursday, May 10th. It is a
seven-column folioj typographically neat and editorially and
locally fully up to standard. The names at the masthead
are: H. R. Osborne, editor and proprietor; G. E. McKay,
assistant editor and advertising manager. The Ledger ex
tends fraternal greeting. -
The House on Tuesday of this week sent to the^Senate
the last of the general appropriation bills— the Military
Academy bill—and will be ready to adjourn as soon as the
Senate disposes of those it has uot passed and the two houses
adjust the defference in conference. The bill to establish a
civil Government for Alaska was taken up Wednesday.
LAST Tuesday afternoon a fire occurred at the Paris Ex
position that for a time threatened the American section of
the Palace of Electricity. Intense alarm was caused by the
blaze, but after an hour's hard work the fire was extinguished
with slight damage to a portion of the woodwork beneath the
Chateau d'Eau and a few tapestries.
The time within which ratification of the Nicaragua
Canal treaty may be exchanged has been extended seven
months from August sth next. This action was taken be
cause of the probability that the Senate would not act upon
the treaty at this session.
Hon. Wm. H. Mills, who is in charge of the Southern
Pacific exhibit in Paris, is adding many laurels to his already
brilliant diadem of business acumen. He is rated among the
brightest Americans there.
Champion Jim Jeffries says he is ready to meet either
Fitzsiminons or Sharkey right a\«y. He also manifests a
willingness to give Jim Corbett another fight, and it is said
that they will have another mill six months hence.
By the help of the Governor of Montana Senator Clark
appears to have evolved victory out of ignominious defeat.
*3r ne ways of politicians are past fiudiug out.

ROUSING STATE CONVENTION
Eepublican Delegates Meet
at Sacramento.
COLONEL E. A. FORBES IS UDE fIUHIIIUI
Delegates to the Rational Convention
Elected.— A Strong Platform Is:
Adopted.
The Republican State Convention
was caljed to order at 2:30 p. m. Mon
day by Hon. George C. Pardoe, Vice
Chairman of the State Central Commit
tee, who said th« Kupublican party was
proud of its record of the past four
years. In that time it had carried a
war to a successful issue, and earned
the respect of Kuropean . nations. It
had carried out all its pledges, made
four years ago. (Cheers.) • ■ •
f d Colonel George Stone of San Fran
cisco, said it was distinctly an honor for
any man to be chosen to preside over a
Republican convention. - The Repuhl; :
can party also delights in honoring
worthy members of it. He felt sure' of
its selecting the gentleman whom he
should name, for it was not only a com
pliment to him but to the convention.
He was a patriotic citizen and asoldier,
a native son and a man well fitted to
preside over its deliberations. . He
would place in nomination Colonel E.
A. Forbes. (Cheors.)
George A. Knight seconded the nom
ination. He said it was well known
what position Colonel Forbes held in
the politics of the State. It would look
well to the people of the United States,
for the native son,* ..he soldier who car
ried the flag, to lv) nominated to this
position. . .
Judge McKinloy said that on behalf
of Los Angeles, he aleo wanted to sec
ond the nomination. \ •
Judge C. A. Dibble moved that nom
inations be closed and Colonel Forbes
nominated by acclamation, which was
done amid great enthusiasm, and Col
onel Stone and Judge McKinley ap
pointed a committee to escort him to
the chair. " ", ;
Colonel Forbes' said that he was
deeply grateful for tho honor 'so unan
imously conferred ! upon him and
thankful at this time to be associated
with such an assembly of Republicans
— representatives of the Republican
party; that party which has as mile
stones in its pathway the names of such
statesmen and patriots as Abraham
Lincoln, Jame* A. Garfield, James G.
Blame, U. S. Grant and others; that
party had stood ever since its birth
upon its foundation of granite, for
human rights and human liberty. . The
next milestone would record tho name
of a man equal to his ' predecessors,
that of William McKinley. Ho paid a
glowing tribute to the President,' and
said, the party, under. his administra
tion had never heard the wail " of
Coxey's army nor hungry mechanics
but has always had and always will
have the honor of busy -factories and
the shout of prosperity, blended with
praise of-its leaders. >
It had always been founded on the
pathway of human rights and liberties,
and we have the right to feel proud and
grateful to have a chance to be with
the party of McKinley, the man whose
name has been since childhood known
as the friend of the laboring man: the
man who in youth went out to carry a
musket in defense of the flag. It is safe
to say that whin-over McKinley, the
patriot and statesman plants that flag on
a soil blotted with wrong and tyranny,
bo will never pull it down. (Cheers.)
He felt he could not conclude without
paying a tribute to the chief executive
of this Commonwealth, the Governor
who is fearless in tho exercise of hU
duty, without fear when satisfied he is
in the right and keeping the plodges
made before the election, and who en
joys the confidence of the people. (A
storm of applause). . « , '
Judge A. C. Hinkson said that he
was disposed to welcome the convention
on behftlf of the raay«r whji) was un
avoidably absent. He would s»y fpr
him that the people of Sacramento are
pleased and' honored on this occasion
and the only recompense asked is that
citizens may so treat their visitors that
on future occassions . they may desire
to come here again. It is the desire of
th<! Executive Committee that they
shall ill IcitKe H-'itl) the impression that
all has been liana (.hst. js possible to
make their stay pleasant.,

vsumm Aiiusaa wuvubii —
It Is now estimated by those : posted
that the mill now buildiug at the Cen
tral Eureka mine will be in operation
by the fourth of July. The recent
crushing of rock at the Zeila mill from
this mine averaged about $90 a ton,
thus some $46,000 has been added to
the exchequer of the company. This
mine evidentally has a great future.
The output of this mine is simply
phenomenal. Two years ago this
month the outlook was dark and
gloomy for the stockholders. The
shaft was down about eleven hundred
feet and the best rock to be bad would
not show but a little better than $1.50
a ton., At that time the mine" was of
. fered ijo the Argonaut Mining Company
at a very low figure and W. F. Dotert,
president of the Argonaut Company,
was in favor of .Ijuyiiyr a.,cpntr,o.Uing
interest. • His associates in.b'uslnbSs op-,
posed the purchase however and the
golden opportunity passed never to ap
pear again. The mine under Supt.
Thomas' excellent management, . has
forged ahead until to-day it ranks with
the best properties In the county. The
production so far is as follows:".' ?• ; . '■'■

V. N. Miller, for many years con
nected with the Utica Is about to com
mence operations on the \ California
Ophir at Carson Hill. He is awaiting
the arrival of tools and machinery
now. '-' V . _-..:
The Gold win Company, operating
near Jamestown, has just ordered from
the Angels Iron works a complete
hoisting plant with a nine and "one-half
foot Pelton wheel. An air. "compressor
goes with the outfit and a ton-stamp
mill is to follow.
Citizen; Charles Zavalla says that
during the past year he has taken out
ore from his Amador mine and shipped
totheSelby works la San Francisco
which yielded him $6000. '
The Lone Star Company has given a
contract for sinking 500 feet. A num
ber of men are at work there now put
ting up a hoist and making prepara
tions to begin sinking.
■ The pump is running night and day
at the Lockwood and as soon as the
water is taken from the mine work will
be resumed. In its palmy days, some
ten years ago, 100 men were employed
in this mine and it yielded vast divi
dends to its owners, and I predict a
bright future for the property.
Mr. Sherman and his son are : push
ing a tunnel in on the Matrimony mine
owned by Mr. Moore. They are In
about 175 feet and have about 350 feet
further to run before they > reach" the
lode.
A large body of the richest kind of
ore has been struck in the Cape Horn
mine, owned by the Greve boys but
bonded to Charles Zavalla. The ore is
so rich that It is necessary to carry It
away In sacks. Sixty tons of ore from
this mine is now being crushed at the
Paragon mill.
' Jl is repprted that Ex-Senator Voor
heis of Sutter Creek will soon -reopen
the Mitchell mine at Railroad Flat.
There is some fine looking rock in
sight at this mine, and should'; the re
port prove true the Senator is the.
man who will take It out and make the
mine a good producer.
The new pump for the Kentucky
mine has arrived and work will be im
mediately commenced unwaterlng the

Colonrl Robinson, who has a two
year bond on the Giuffra mine at Mo-
kelumno Hill, has commenced sinking
a two-compartment shaft, and last
week put on a number of men for that
work. The Colonel also has a working
bond on the Wesson mine, which ad
joins theffirst named property. The
roelc from the Wesson will be hauled
to the Giuffra mill and a test run of
100 tons will be immediately made.
W. C. Ralston of the Melones Com
pany at Robinsons Ferry is expected at
the mines this week. He has been in
the East for some time on business
connected with the property and when
he ; arrives work will be prosecuted
vigorously. ~ Everything is being put
in shape at ' the mine, mill ditch and
dam, and at present about twenty-five
men are employed in the tunnel, which
is now in about 2700 feet and will be
driven about 1000 further, when it is
thought the ledge will be struck. The
ledge has been well prospected and the
120 stamps will be ablo to run for years
on what is known to be thore.' The
ore pays from $5 per ton up.
: TUOLUMNE COUNTY
Now. Era: The shaft on the Tuol
umne Standard has reached a depth of
thirty -five feet, with sinking going
steadily on. The pay streak shows
three .feet of quartz, giving also every
Indication of widening. The' property
is owned by Maler, Dean & Boyle.
The Spring Gulch was last week re
leased on bond by -Its owner, Robert
Marshall, fb M. Arendt, the Stent
merchant.- The latter is conceded to
be a shrewd operator as well as being
in close touch with people who stand
willing to put 'up plenty of money on
any quartz property tliey undertake to
exploit. The Spring Gulch is beyond
question a thoroughly good mine, but
it seems to have played in bad luck
ever since it first struck the tobogan of
misfortune. Up to within a few weeks
ago it' was 'controlled by , the Carters
Gold Mining Company, but Mr. Mar
shall claimed that concern had failed
to "live up to the conditions set forth In
the bond and again took charge of
it himself. Mr. Arendt has agreed to
erect a mill at once, though he has 60
days in which to begin grading; also
to start sinking in the old shaft simul
taneous with the crushing of the first
rock. shaft is now 500 feet deep,
so that In case he wishes to stope out
the ore between the bottom level and
the one at 400. feet.be must at the same
time sink to the 600 foot mark, cross
cut the" vein and establish a new level.
It is safe to assert' that In the very
near future the mine will repeat the
showing that once gained it a sensa
tional reputation..

A LETTER FROM ALASKA
Dr. Gibbons Writes About
Juneau.
AMADOR GITY BASE BALL CLUB GIVES A DANCE
Amador People Visit and Have Visit
ors.—Typhoid Fever At South
Jackson.
Juneau, Alaska, April 29, 1900.
Dear Ledger:
Juneau' is the largest town in
south-eastern Alaska. It was founded
In 1881 by two pi-ospeetors named
Harris and Juneau, was fiist called Har
risburg but the name was afterward
changed to Juneau, (pronounced ' Juno).
It lies at the foot of a mountain about
4000 feet high, and is built partly upon
a bluff and partly upon planking gup
ported by piles. In this part of the
town the cellars are filled with brine at
high tide. About half the mountain
side is covered with a dense, growth .of
spruce, hemlock and cedar. The rest
Is too precipitous for a tree to obtain a
foothold. This affords a charming
sight when the t,un shines upon the
rivulets caused by the pelting snow
above. The numerous little cascades
of stream and spray glistening, foam
ing, dashing down the rocky ravines
In the almost, quite, or more, than per
pendicular walls, form a cample of
Nature's finest handiwork. ' I said
when the sun shines. 1 should say It
is more charming then. We have
seldom seen the sun since our arrival.
There has been two lino days and two
or three fragments of pleasant
weather In three weeks; 1 It is related
that a chechako (new comer) asked an
Indian, "Does it at ways rain in
Juneau?" and the noble redman. re
plied, "No, sometime he-«snow."J But
this Is said to be the wettest part of the
year and we hope for better times.'
This town is on the east side' of the
Gastineaux Channel, a small arm of the
sea,- that cuts Douglas Island off the
main land, and Is about a mile in width.
The average tide is sixteen feet, the
high tide twenty-eight. A few morn
ings ago we were treated to a novel
sight. Half a dozen small icebergs
had been driven up the channel by the.
storm, and the retreating tide had left
them high and dry — no, cold,. upon the
bar, close to town. The largest was
about the size of Mr. Caminetti's of
fice, light blue In color, Irregular in
shape. Of course these were only
homeopathic specimens of real icebergs.
. Juneau has about 3000 population.
The streets are covered with 4-inch

and prices about the same as in Jack
son. The town is closely biiilt, entirely
of wood, and sure to be swept by ' fire
sooner or later. Insurance rates are
less than might be expected,' three to
six per cent. This is due to the splen
did fire service. One day while on the
street I heard the alarm bell and took
out my watch. In 56 seconds a hose
cart was on the street. In two minutes
the three carts of the tire department
were at the scene. The pressure is
sufficient to throw water over the high
est building in town. The streettt are
washed twice a week and Av*\ is a

here. Methodist, Episcopal, Presby

EFFECT OF THE AWFUL SOLITUDE
WHEN FIRST EXPERIENCED.
The Awe Inspiring Stillness Makes
Sleep am Impossibility ' For Many
and Brings Visions of Terror to
Haunt the Tired Senses, j
The awe inspiring stillness of the
first night in camp! You lie on your
back vainly courting sleep. Vainly, I
my. because of the very Intense still
ness which should woo it, but does not,
as you are unused to it. Your guide
lies motionless, only his heavy breath
ing denoting that he is alive. It is sec
ond nature to him to sleep In the heart
of the wilderness, and his tired body
no more than touches the sweet scent
ed pine boughs when he slumbers.
It will be so with you when you have
accustomed yourself to the preternat
ural quiet so different from the rumble
of passing vehicles over paved streets
and which affects you not.* But tonight
your eyelids are opened wide, and In
stead of the blissful forgetfulness
which you anticipated, your every
sense is on the alert to catch and di
vine the meaning of the strange noises
which fill the woods of northern Maine.
In front of your rude camp, which
is left open, the smoldering fire smokes
and crackles, each snap of charred em
bers sounding to your ears like the re
port of artillery. It is a strange sensa
tion, this first night in the woods.
Away up on the mountain side a fox
barks. The weird howl echoes and
re-echoes down the mountain side un
til it seems to reach the lake and float
over its glassllke surface until It is
swallowed up In the dark water.
. A night owl makes bold to disturb
your already troubled mind by perch
ing on a big pine not a hundred feet
away and sending forth a screech that
curdles' your blood until you realize
what it really is. Directly back of you
is the Jake shore.
Suddenly comes a soft tread over
dried brush. Surely some one is steal
ing up to your camp. You rise to a sit
ting position and await the marauder's
next move. Then once more you hear
' the snap, snap, snap of bis feet as he
cautiously draws near. Louder and
louder, you cannot be mistaken this
time; this is no trick of the imagina
tion.
Now he must be directly beside you,
with nothing but a wall of boughs be
tween. You can stand it no longer,
and, with a half suppressed yell of ex
citement, you seize your gun, spring to
.your feet, dash aside the light canvas
that falls over the front of the camp
Just enough to keep out the smoke
and run out prepared to shoot on sight.
There Is a mad scramble, a crackling
of twigs, a mad splash, and— the head
of a very badly frightened muskrat
can just be seen on the lake's surface
as it frantically pushes Its way into
the gloom.
You creep softly back to your boughs
rather ashamed at yourself and glance
furtively at the guide, who sleeps
peacefully through it all.. At last na
ture asserts herself and gradually you
feel the drowsiness of approaching
slumber steal over you. You slightly
raise your head to take one last look
at the flickering log that splutters
away outside.
Hiet! What's that? Two fiery eyes
set in the framework of Impenetrable
gloom beyond the fire seem staring di
rectly at you. Like coals, they burn
and the words of your guide, "Oh,
yes, thar's plenty of bar ron yere,"
come back to you with awful import.
Then you hear the tread of his cushion
padded feet moving here and there,
but 'those awful eyes never once turn
fronl yoo. They burn you with their
hypnotic, baleful glare, and with a
calmness you would not have believed
you possessed, you softly reach for
your rifle.
A muskrat may be a joke, but a hun
gry bear prowling within 20 feet of you
"s an unsafe guest. You know you are
as white as a sheet, and your hands
tremble as you bring the piece to your
shoulder and aim directly between
those awful greenish yellow eyes. Sup
pose yon miss; but, no, you will not
Your linger presses the trigger. |
The roar of your rifle sounds like a
clap of thunder, and its reverberations
roll and chase each other over the tops
of the pines and spruces and startle a
thousand sleeping creatures who ren
der night hideous with their frighten
ed cries as they scurry or fly away
from your vicinity. It's a rude way to
awaken a man, and no wonder your
guide jumps up yelling like a Co
manche Indian and nearly knocks out
the back of the camp as he runs
against lt.'V" ;
When he finds you pale and trem
bling and hears you declare that you
have shot a bear, he mutters Incred
ulously and, lighting a lantern, goes
out to Investigate. You hear a loud
French-Canuck laugh as he returns
carrying by the tail a headless chip
munk, which he tosses at your feet
"You wan good shot, m'sleur. j You
heet him square 'tween de eyes. No
ehoot better meself, but ah tlnk you
narve, what you call, onstrlng, you
better take wan good dreenk 'n go to
sleep."
So are sounds magnified in the si
lence of a first night In the Maine

Oar Debt to the Barm Pottl.
It Is quite possible, though of course
not demonstrable, that the humble
barn fowl has been a larger benefactor
of our race than any mechanical In
vention in our possession, for there Is
no inhabited country on earth today
where the barn fowl Is not a mainstay
«f health. There are vast regions of
South America and Europe where it is
the mainstay, and nowhere is there
known anything that can take its
place, which Is probably more than can
be said of anything in the world of
mechanics.— Century.
Swelled the Collection.
A man came up to me one day after
service In a frontier town and was
pleased to address me in this manner:
"Say, parson, that there service and
Eermon was grand. I wouldn't have
missed 'em for $5."
When I suggested that he hand me
the difference between the amount he
had put In the collection basket and
the figure be mentioned for my mis
sionary work, he stopped suddenly,
looked at me with his mouth wide open
and then slowly pulled from his pock
et $4.90, which he handed to me with
out a word.— Rev. Cyrus Townsend

A Forgotten Countersign.
"War with raw recruits in the begin
ning is apt to lead to many amusing
experiences," said the old anuy officer
who saw service in Cuba. "Now, you
couldn't ask for better soldiers than we
had in Cuba, but a large number of
them were new to the business and had
much to learn, and, much to their cred
it, it can be said that they soon learned
it
"I had occasion to leave our lines one
night soon after we arrived in Cuba,
and upon my return it suddenly struck
me that I had forgotten the counter
sign. I puzzled over It for some time,
but for the life of me I couldn't recall
the word that had been given out.
While I was thinking it over I heard
the command:
" 'Halt! Who comes there?*
" 'Friend,' I answered, thinking that
the countersign would come to me in a
moment
" 'Advance, friend, and give the coun
tersign,' said the sentry.
"As the countersign had slipped from
me completely I walked up to him and
said sharply:
" 'Call the corporal of the guard!'
" 'Gosh,' answered the sentry, 'I
knew It was something like that, but
I'm derned' if I hadn't forgotten it!

Chlneae Leather.
"The process by vrfilch the Chinese
leather acquires its peculiar character
istics Is described as follows:
The skins are put into tubs contain
ing water, saltpeter and salt and after
30 days are taken out, the hair is shav
ed off and the skins well washed in
spring water. Each hide Is then cut up
Into three pieces and well steamed,
which Is done by passing them several
times backward and forward over a
steaming even. Further, each piece is
stretched out separately over a flat
board and secured with nails, so as to
dry gradually - and thoroughly In the
sun. The smoke of the oven makes
the leather black, and If It ts desired
to have It of a yellow appearance it is
rubbed over with water in which the
fruit of the so called wongchee tree has
been soaked. "£- /\
Of the offal glue is made by heating
It In pans for 12 hours over a slow flre,
and the glue so obtained is poured into
rough earthen vessels, where it re
mains three days In order to coagulate.
The solid mass is cut into pieces with
sharp knives and carefully laid upon
gratinglike trays to dry, the time taken
In drying varying from 5 dsiys, with a
northwest wind, to 30 or 40 days with
a southwest. — Boston Transcript.
The Land of the Guitar.
In Portugal men play upon the gui
tar as naturally as Yankees whistle.
The peasants are universally given to
the Instrument, chiefly as an accom
paniment to the voice. In towns and
villages the artisans are- often expert
guitar players and walk In groups to
and from their work, enlivening the
Journey with music and song. The
carpenter who comes to your house to
execute a small job brings his guitar
-with his tools, and the blacksmith Is a
far better performer on the guitar than
the anvil.
When the Portuguese day laborer or
workman has finished his long day's
toil, he does not hie him to a wineshop
to squander the few cents he has earn
ed; he does not even lean against a
post and smoke . or whittle a stick
while swapping yarns with his fellows.
If he did not bring his guitar with him,
he goes straight home and gets it, rests
and comforts himself with the music
while supper is being prepared. After
ward he spends the evening singing
doggerel songs to a strumping accom
paniment, tilted back in a chair against
his own house or on the doorster) of a
neighbor.— Philadelphia Record.

Soap aa a Germ Killer.

killer, and, according to Professor Sera

"Silencing a Can."
There is a great deal of Ignorance as
to what "silencing a gun" means. A
gun is silenced when the gunners are
disabled or driven back and the gun or
gun carriage damaged. It is a common
enough phenomenon for weapons
which have thus been silenced to re
open flre after repairs have been made,
the gunners rallied or a fresh gun crew
obtained. It is a rare thing for a gun
to be so damaged by hostile fire that it
cannot be refitted and brought Into ac
tion again. "I saw," says Prince Kraft
of the German artillery in the battle of
Gravelotte, "many guns during the
cannonade lying miserably on the
ground 'winged'— that is, with a broken
wheeL But not one was withdrawn.
The injured guns were always speed
ily repaired with the help of the wag
ons, which were near, 60 that at the
close of the battle I could not tell ex
actly how many pieces had been put

ROYAL NAMES A HOODOO.
One of the Strongest Superstitions
of the English Navy.
Ono.of the very strongest and most
Ineffaceable of all superstitions In the
royal navy, a superstition that is al
most as strong today as ever it was, Is
that vessels bearing the names of roy
al personages are doomed. to ill luck,
and, strange as it may seem, there Is
an undeniable historic basis for this
feeling.
Some of the most terrible disasters
ever known In connection with our na
vy have concerned war vessels with
royal names. Two vessels called the
Royal James came to disastrous ends.
One of them exploded, and some 800
officers and seamen perished. The oth
er ship so named was actually carried
out of the mouth of the Thames by the
Dutch Admiral de Ruyter under cir
cumstances disgraceful to those In
charge of the craft
Then there is the forever memorable
disaster to the Royal George, an un
lucky ship previously, that turned over
and sank in sight of crowds at Spit
head, over 1,000 souls, among whom
were 300 women,' being sacrificed. And
second only to this hideous disaster is
that which afterward the Royal
Charlotte, which, after a . career of
much vicissitude, was consumed by
fire off Leghorn, over 800 of the very
flower of the navy perishing with her. j
When In 1893 the Victoria, a new
vessel and the very triumph of modern
Invention so far as naval architecture
went, was rammed and sank at once
in sight of the whole fleet and when
hundreds of lives were lost, there was
not a sailor, however matter of fact he
might be, who did not remember the
dire fate of the royally named craft.
These instances are only the greater
ones. A score of smaller ones are reel
ed off by every royal navy man. — Tit-

Paid For His Joke.
The editor is fond of a Joke and has
the good sense to appreciate one at his
own expense. A few weeks ago he
was walking with a friend, and at the
corner of a busy thoroughfare he saw a
dilapidated looking Hibernian standing
at the opposite corner gazing listlessly
into vacancy.
"Watch me surprise this old fellow,"
eaid he to his friend. "Look right into
his face and see If It won't be a study."
• A second later they were abreast of
the son of Erin, and the editor pulled
out a silver coin and said as he thrust
it into the man's hand: "Here's that
half a crown I owe you. Now, don't
go round any more telling people that
I don't pay my debts."
For a second the man's face was a
study. He was amazed at the unlook
ed for kindness, and then, as its pur
port dawned on him, be raised bis hat
and said: "Heaven bless yer 'ouner!
I'll never say another word agin ye.
But," and his eyes twinkled merrily,
"are ye sure It wasn't a crown ye
owed me?"
The friend roared: "Oh, pay the man
in full! Don't try to beat him out of a
paltry half crown." The Irishman got
his crown, but the editor no longer
pays his debts at sight now.— London

Henry George* First Friend.
In the late seventies Henry George,
the single tax reformer, came east
from California. He was desperately
poor and had but few acquaintances.
Shortly after his arrival he lectured
before the Saturday Ethical club of
New York, where his brilliant oratory
and shabby attire made so striking a
contrast as to excite the sympathy of
those present.
After he left' the club appointed a
committee to aid him In getting up a
public lecture. Among others, the com
mittee included Seth Low, who was
then engaged in business. He was in
consultation at the time, and the com
niittee were in a hurry, so he told them
to send him a lot of tickets. They for
warded 20 to him the same day and
felt happy at having secured $20 for
the lecture fund. The next morning
raine a letter of thanks from Mr. Low
praising the lecturer's intellectuality
and inclosing a check for $250. The
affair was a success, netting about
$300, so that President Low may be
said to have been the first man to start
Mr. George on his eastern career.
Twenty years later, In 18»7, Mr. Low
was the citizens' candidate and Mr.
George the labor candidate for mayor
of New York. The latter made a vig
orous campaign and In all his speeches
advised the cklzeps, If they could not
vote for him, to vote for his frjppd
Seth Low, and on one occasion he said
that if it had not been for. the latter
he would not be there as a candidate.

"Ah, that was because you were not

and, unclasping my belt, placed it in

thus directing him, pursued my game

Sham Antiquities.
A few years ago,. in Soho, London,
there was a factory for antique cop
pers which Is probably still In opera
tion. The legitimate business of the
place was the manufacture of stew
pans and kettles, but when trade was
dull In that way any sort of antiques
for which there happened to be a de
mand was produced instead.
An old Incense burner, for example,
would be reproduced by the dozen by
hammering over a chuck. If orna
mented with pierced work, the copies
would be coated with asphaltum,
through which the design would be
traced, when It would then be eaten
out In an acid bath, saving the. time
which would be required to cut out
the pattern with a piercing saw. The
bath leaves thin edges, by which such
work may be detected.
The work would then be annealed
and would be permitted to oxidize and
