ha he disrics composing he

our answer would bePersonal Le i perish,

more hereafer
The sceond quesion is more easily
answered, in he firs place be
burden of axes imposed on be ax
payers of be Union disric was so
much in excess of wha hey were led
o beliee i would be This caused
in a measure by be effors of be
rusees o pay or an expensie
building and equipmen in oo shor
a erm of years, and by hose same
rusees being oo free o spend
money for labaory expenses, which
should properly hae been paid (as
elsewhere) by be sudens who use
he labraory supplies
Mo uiion was chared a firs o
ouside sudens, and ha imposed a
ery unjus burden of snppor on be

of sae aid is no enough o couner

happy medium would perhaps bue

Why? Because i unfis raher han

There were six in he pary Personal John
Garbarini, Frank Voorbeis, Jack bar
on, all of Jackson, E G mick of

and Fred Johnson of New Hope
The spo seleced for heir camp
was a he bear rier dam of he
Sandard Elecric Company— an ideal
place for angling and huning I is
beween fory and fify miles from
Jaokson Two men — Fred Ois and
Whieman, are keepers cf he dam,
remaining winer and summer o look
afer he company's ineress
> When he Jaokson pary reached
here he snow in places was piled up
six or seen fee deep, bu be warm
weaher since has reduced i o he
liquid sae
Fishing was no as good as i migh
be, alhough he boys caugh pleny
for heir own consumpion Some of
he rou capured weighed oer wo
pounds
mick, he lone represenaie,
carried off be honors of be rip
He succeeded in shooing a couple of
deer, and he monarch of he fores—
a cinnamon bear— was corraled in big
rap, wih be bai of bis furnishing
The mehod adoped in capuring his
brue alie is worhy of exended ex
planaion
In preparing for his excursion,
mick ook be precauion of aking
wih him an old horse rriing a
he huning grouuds, his animal
was sho a a spo seleced Then a
powerful seel rap was brough ino
play, i was fasened by means of a
chain o a long loose sapling, sonic
weny fee in lengh The rap iself
weighed sixy pounds, and wih log
aud chain fully wo hundred pounds
I was proided wih eeh, so ha
when is jaws came ogeher wih a
snap, he spikes would bold wih he
grip of a ise anyhing ha came
wihin is grasp Ihe approach was
lxed up by means of logs placed in a
slaning posiion, so ha bruin could
only ge o he feas prepared for him
by sepping across he narrowes par
o he V formed by hese logs On be
oher side of be sicks was secreed
he rap, carefully coered up wih
brush and earh I was designed
ha he firs paw ha Mr bear placed
oer be dead lie would spring he
rap and cause be foo o be clamped
ighly by he rap, he aachmens
of chain and log being inended o
impede his moemens afer capure
Oa Saurday, July 13, fonr or fie
days aler arranging he rap, mick
and Garbarini repaired o he spo o
see how maers were progressing I
was a mile aud a half disan from
be camp by he dam before reach
ing he place, hey heard he disress
edcries of bruin, bellowing like a
calf, and hey were saisfied ha be
decoy had worked o a charm I
was shorly afer day ligh ha hey
oane up o him He bad eidenly
only been rapped a shor ime,
alhough considerably fagged ou by
bis effors o release himself from bis

wih he iew of ailing him alie o

ed en masse o be scene o assis in
Ibe capure
The animal had no raeled more
han a hundred fee from he poin of
capure The long sick had become
jammed agains he runk of a ree
so be brue was prey well ied up
and exhaused by bis effors o
escape fer seeral aemps, wo

He was a big specimen of his ribe,

Kennedy Mr Lepley was worried
oer he idings of eil, and deer
mined o find ou be ruh Las
week he elegraphed o  Nooe,
requesing him o answer by elegram
wha be knew abou he maer
Las Saurday he receied a dis
pach in reply, no from Nooe, bu
form uurke himself, saying briefly
ha he was alie and well, and ha a
leer would follow by be nex mail
The leer came o band promply,
and shows ha here was no a shred
of ruh in he whole sory of in
saniy The young man explains ha
aer working in blair for some ime,
he lef ha camp, aud proceeded o
Goldfield— supposed o be he Mecca
of he hoss of labor, where abund
ance of work a op noch wages i
ready for all comers He was sadly
disappoined, and found eeryhing
oerdone, wih a dozen men waiing
o grab eery job in sigh He nex
wen o Tonopab, and hoped o ge

of his kind were scarce So finally
he drifed back o Blair, and a he

Ihe labor union folks hae also

[Copyrigh, 1907, by P C Easmen]
I was wih eecie Hogan he day
he firs saw he lile widow Carson
He had a case on in cour, and she
was a winess for he defense Her
esimony cleared his prisoner, al
hough he had a good case, bu he did
no hold i up agains her, as would
hae been naural
For long weeks I kep ab on Hogan
as a ciizen He aced jus as anoher
man would His admiraion for he
lile widow impelled him o seek an
inroducion fer ha he was hard
hi He became a frequen caller, and
in ime we all came o know ha he
was one of her suiors and he faored
one I seemed funny ha he aheuld
send her bouques and don a dress sui
and accompany her o he heaer
One day I was surprised ou of my
boos by he deecie siing down
wih me aud giing me his confidence
ou' imagine I was abou any offi
cial case I was as a man ha he
waned o alk wih me abou being in
loe wih he widow  ery young
man or an old bachelor will ofen do
ha She hadn' acceped him in so
many words, bu he wns sure ha his
loe was reciprocaed He was lo
ing her as a man, bu he had sized her
up as a deecie From bis reading
of her characer she was close upon
he "order of angelic He had looked
for a Haw in ain He was saisfied,
and more han saisfied, and naurally
he waned all ohers o be so I could
ell you here ha I differed wih him
in many respecs, no orally, bu men
ally, and hus make ou ha I was
possessed of superior acumen, bu 1
am no posing in ha direcion To
some one else I migh hae said my
say, bu no o Hogan He would hae
been down on me a he firs word
The case in which he widow had
been a winess for he defense was
one of forgery bou he ime Hogan
gae me his confidence hree banks
were icimized he same day Signa
ures of deposiors were counerfeied
and oer $3,000 hauled in In each
case he check was presened by a
woman, a fairly all woman, wearing
glasses and supposed o be oer mid
dle age s her ideniy was ouched
for, he eller had o coun ou he
money The case was gien o Hoggn,
aud he ook i up wih he umos
ardor and confidence  week passed,
aud here were wo more forgeries
Then, a few days laer, wo or hree
checks were kied I was all done
by he same woman, aud ye Hogan
hadn' sruck a clew He was so ho
on he rail, howeer, ha she changed
her acics She inrused he checks
o an old man and raised $10,000 in a
day "Wha's he maer wih Ho
gau?" was being asked a headquar
ers; bu, besir himself as he would
aud did, he could no adance his case
By forgery and check raising he gang
scooped in nearly $30,000, and no one
of hem was spoed
Then occurred wha some of us call
ed a laughable hing and made merry
oer Hogan was a hrify man He
had saed money from his salary, and
he had speculaed, aud his bank ac
coun sood ery close o $20,000 He
was a deposior a a sae bank, and
one day he same old man presened a
check for $15,000 and drew ou he
money I was Hogan's signaure as
plain as day, and he had no only
ouched for he signaure of he oh
er, bu had sen along a brief noe
The eller ried o reach him a head
quarers, bu failed o ge he con
necion, aud be check was paid Two
hours laer Hogan was roaring around
ha bank like an angry lion He had
been done for I was only naural
ha he should call on he widow ha
eening o relae his loss, and, her
sympahies being aroused, he climax
came — ha is, she leaned her head on
his salwar shoulder and murmured
ha she would be his She was sorry
for his loss, bu she had enough for
boh
Two eenings laer he wen up o
make sure of he dae of he wedding
day, and she was ou He did no go
again for a week, being busy on his
case, and when he nex appeared he
house was empy and had been for
seeral days His peie fiancee had
fled For a day or wo he man fough
hard agains he belief ha he had
been duped Then he man ook a
back sea, and he deecie came o
he fron, and i did no ake him long
o figure ou hings The cue lile
widow was no widow a all, bu he
wife of an adenurer She had been
an acress, and she knew all abou
makeups She had been drien o e
ery bank in a carriage in shoes ha
increased her naural heigh by six
Inches Pencil and pain had pu on
wrinkles and lines, and she had aken
care o dress for he occasion Hogan
himself would no hae known her on

jus aa arfully disguised, and when
he ;oin of safey had been reached

Tha hing mus hae come hard on
