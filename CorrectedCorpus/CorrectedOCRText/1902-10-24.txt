TOOL THAT ALMOST TALKS
Yet Its Complicated Mci Uanlam Can
Be Tended by a Girl
The most highly deeloped of ma
chine tools is the automatic screw ma
chine, and, like many another con
triance for saing labor, its home Is
New England It Is a deelopment of
the ordinary steel working lathe, the
Intermediate step being the monitor
lathe In which the arious cutting
tools protrude from the side of a steel
turret like thirteen Inch guns from a
battleship turret In the nonautouiatlc
screw machine the turret is reoled
by the operator so as to bring each tool
Into play Just as the on the old
Monitor was reoled to bring one gun
after another Into action But In the
automatic machine the work is done
without human guidance
In making screws, nuts, bolts, studs
and other small pieces that must be
turned, drilled or threaded for watches,
docks, typewriters, electrical Instru
ments and other mechanisms all the
operator has to do Is to feed the
"6tock"— a long, thin rod of steel or
brass— to the machine The feeding
mechanism carries the rod slowly for
ward Into the field of action The tur
ret adances and puts its first tool at!
work on the end of the rod When this
tool has done its task, the turret with
draws it, turns and adances a second
tool into action Each cutting tool
around the turret has its distinct work
to perform— one cutting a thread, an
other shaping a head, another putting
on a point another drilling a hole, still
another putting on knurling The tur
ret automatically brings each of per
haps six tools into action, and when
the work Is finished the completed
screw drops Into a pan, while the
"stock" Is automatically fed forward
to begin the complex operation again
A stream of machine oil pours contin
uously on the work to carry away the
heat and the little metal cuttings coU
lect in a heap under the machine
Hour after hour this wonderful au
tomaton goes through its cycle of oper
ations, the turret clicking eery mo
ment as It brings a new tool forward,
Small brass pieces, on which but one
tool cuts, are dropped at the rate of
four a second Large screws of com
plicated design upon which a whole
turretful of tools must work are cut
from a steel rod at the rate of one or
two a minute So perfectly are these
screw machines constructed that an un
skilled workman can operate a row of
them All he is required to do is to keep
them fed with "stock" In some shops
girls tend the machines— Success

CUTTING HIMSELF OFF;
B»e Slant Way In Which rtmpljrta
;c Cannon Refused a Fortune 1 "^
; The Re Edward Cannon, a ' chap
lain to King George IV, was a dog
gedly independent man On one occa
sion he refused to compliment his roy
al master on hie singing and for a
time fell into disfaor  His manner
waa high handed and not aliaja too
courteous, but his actions' were always
on the side of right and justice The
biography of his friend Barham, the
author of the "Ingoldsby Legends,"
contains, among other anecdotes of
Cannon, the story of how he disinher
ited himself
A silly old lady summoned him to
her house and pretended to be declin
ing in health She told him she had
made her will, by which the whole of
a considerable fortune was to be leti
to him ' •   " • 
j^"ldon't eliee it," said Cannon aft
er a pause, in which he eyed her
doubtfully The lady assured him that
the document was lying In a desk in
the room •
"I won't beliee It," persisted Can
non, "unless I see it"
Smiling at his Incredulity, she placed
the will in his hands Cannon read it
"Well," he said deliberately, "if I
had not seen it In your own hands, I
could not hae belieed you were such
an unnatural brute"
Thrusting the paper between the bars
of the grate, he continued In a seere^
low oicePersonal "Hae you no one more
nearly connected with you than I— no
one to whom your money should go,
who has a right to be proided for
first and best? Pooh! You don't
know how to make a wllL I'll send

ELECTRIFIE HOUSES
Tlie Simple Explanation of a Very
Ordinary Phenomenon
An Instance of nonfamillarity with
simple scientific facts is illustrated by
an article that goes the rouuds of the
press once or twice annually— namely,
the story of the electrified house The
article usually states that some one
has discoered that ' eerything he
touches in his house — the radiators,
picture frames, banquet lamps, etc—
gies him an electric shock; hence he
fears there Is some connection between
the arc light wires and the water pipes
near his residence The electric light
inspector Is therefore summoned and
reports that the wires of his company
are intact and that the electricity must
come from some other source
It does not dawn on any of the peo
ple consulted that the discoerer of
the phenomenon is unconsciously per
forming one of the simplest and oldest
of electrostatic experiments, the shuf
fling of his shoes oer tlie pry carpet
raising the potential of his body to
seeral thousand olts, which discharge
at eery opportunity One may een
get ejeptric discharges from his knuc
kles against the brass lock of a hand
bag which he may be carrying while
walking on a stone paement during
cold, dry weather
But, dismissing newspaper science,
it Is somewhat astonishing, in iew of
the many ways In which In cold, dry
countries electricity is unintentionally
deeloped and manifested by spark
ing, that the first knowledge concern
ing this phenomenon did not come to
the ancients In this way rather than
by the attraction of light substances
by amber The explanation of this,
howeer, may be that the scientists of
bygone days did not reside in cold, dry
countries— Cassler's Magazine
When to Bat Krnlt
t
The question is often asked, At what
time of day should fruit be eaten? In
tropical countries, where fruit is the
chief article of food, the rule appears
to bejthat the earlier in the day It Is
taken the better and the later the
worse In hot weather many wjse
people will eat none after noon, alleg
ing that the digestion then declines In
power with the decline of the day and
the fruit, instead of digesting, decom
poses owing to the presence of the sac
charine matter The objection to fruit
and certain kinds of egetables late in
the day, be {he expjanaflqn what ft
may, la certainly Justified by an ample
experience, though some persons can
eat fruit at all hours without feeling
any Inconenience — Table Talks

The Shortest lied City
Which of the large cities of the world
had the shortest life?
In the ancient world the answer Is
Palmyra The period of Its prosperity
extended only from 117 to 273^A ,
156 years In the fifth century B C
PersopoUs was the capital of the Per
sian empire for thirty years only, but
this was merely an accident of war
and politics Carthage was the shortest
lied seat of empire, for it only en
dured about 500 years In modern times
the answer would be Amarapura, the
former capital of Burma Founded in
1783, it had In 1800 a population of
175,000 Sixty years later the seat of
goernment was transferred to Man
dalay, and Amarapura is now repre
sented only by a few ruined temples

PLACEBO PRESCRIPTIONS
An Old octor Tells a Secret of Hla
Proxesalon
"Neer tell a patient that there Is
nothing the matter with him," said the
old doctor, who was reealing the se
crets of his profession "If you do, you
make a lifelong enemy and lose your
patient, who sends for another doctor
Gie him something, if it is only flaor
ed water If the disease is only imagi
nary, cure the imagination ! with a
harmless dose, and your , patient gets
well In the profession we call such
prescriptions "placebos,' and more won
derful cures are effected by placebos
than the world wots of So, also, when
you run across a patient who an
nounces the first thing that he cannot
take certain sorts of medicine, don't
tell him he must Agree with him and
gie him the medicine, if he needs It,
hi a disguised form
"There are thousands of people who
labor under the coniction that they
cannot take quinine and will tell you
that they hae neer taken It in their
lies, while at the same time they may
be taking large doses of It The taste
of quinine is hard to disguise, but if
administered in a pill the patient can
be made to take it and neer suspect
what he lias swallowed The trouble
is the patient is apt to recognize a
quinine pill by its appearance, to sus
pect, bite into the pill and thus dis
coer your ruse To obiate this diffi
culty druggists now hae pills of qui
nine made in odd shapes and colors
Pink pills, containing nothing but qui
nine and a little harmless coloring mat
ter, are a faorite form for use in cases
where an antiqulnine crank baa to be
medicated In giing a placebo it is not
wise to hae it taste too well The pa
tient Is apt to suspect if you do And
be sure that you graely impress upon
the patient that only a teaspoonful is
to be taken at a time and that at stated
interals' The whole irtue of a place
bo exists in the solemnity and Impor
tance with which you surround it"—

SCHOOL SUPERINTENENT
Our attention has ! eon called to
an iuaccurancy in cur article pub
lished last week on the caudidacy of
Geo F Mack The article coneys
the idea that Mr Mack's / salary for
the time he was school superintend
ent, was $600 per year The law
proided that if the superintendent
deoted his whole time to the duties
of the office his salary should be
$1200; otherwise $600 In August,
1893, Mr Mack attended to the
duties of his office exclusiely, and
from Aug 21, 1893,,t0 the end of his
official term in January, 1899, he
drew $100 per month, the same as
the present superintendent's salary
for the current term The office of
superintendent of schools is not a
bonanza Considering the amount
of work inoled, it is by long odds
the poorest paid office in connection
with the county goernment The
Ledger has"no complaint to make
against the gentleman now filling
that position We are free to admit
that he has been painstaking and
scrupulously conscientious in the
discharge of his duties We hae
neer intended any remarks i these
columns adocating the support of
Geo F Mack as reflecting in any
way upon the present incumbent
While we differ from him on party
issues, we trust we are not so blindly
partisan as to be incapable of recog
nizing a capable democratic official
We willingly concede that Geo A
Gordon has lied up to the strict
letter of the law, according to his
interpretation thereof More than
this, we gie him credit for holding
aloof from cliques or combinations,
and running his office according to
the dictates of his own judgment
But while admitting all this, we be
liee that Geo F Mack possesses
all the requisites of a faithful and
successful head of ; the educational
department, and therefore we are in
duty bound to support and to
urge upon eery republicau to sup
port him by ote and influence ' C
HOW CONSISTENT
  Many oters now in the county
hae a distinct^ recollection of the
first canass of U S Gregory for
sheriff ten years ago In that cam
paign he told the people substan
tially as followsPersonal "I hae nothing to
Personal say against my opponent, R J
Adams He is a gentleman The
only trouble is, he has been in office
too long I promise you when I
hae held the office as long as he
has, I will not ask for your support
again" After a term of two years,
he was a candidate for reelection,
and again informed the people that
a term of four years more would ap
pease bis thirst for office An in
dulgent public gratified his ambition
again After the lapse of four years
he comes to the front with his mod
esty unruffled, asking for four years
more of the fattest berth connected
with the county goernment — con
siderably fattened too by legislatie
manipulation since he has filled the
position Of course, that would be
the last time he would ask for their
suffrage A confiding people grant
ed this faor, owing to ery excep
tional circumstances existing at that
time So that Mr Gregory has
filled the sheriff's office for a much
longer period than any other man in
the history of Amador county But
een ten years of continuous serice,
at a princely salary, has failed to
conince him of the adisability of
a muchneeded rest He is stump
Eing for another four years — which
would make more than double the
official term of his predecessor —
which he denounced as too lengthy
ten years ago And the peculiar
phase about it is that this prolonged
career has been the most arbitrary
and unpopular the county has eer
known Citizens — republicans and
democrats alike — hae about come
to the conclusion that the only effec
tual way of suppressing this peren
nial craing for office is to beat him
at the ballotbox — and beat him
badly
• The legislatie ticket ; has special
claims for support Party principles
are an issue in the election of state and
national legislators' The continuance
of the present era of prosperity, is de
pendent upon the continued supremacy
Of republican policies On no specious
plea whateer should any republican be
lured from oting for Gilette for con
gress, Ralston for state senator, and
McKenney for assemblyman

HOVy IT GROWS
We hae heretofore called atten
tion to the practice, which may
almost be said to hae grown to a
settled policy, of haing defendants
in criminal cases plead guilty The
only object a person accused of crime
could hae in makiug a plea of
guilty, is to get a lighter sentence
And the only argument that has or
can be urged from a public stand
point in faor of the "pleadguilly"
system, is that the expense of a
trial is thereby aoided It is as
sumed that this manner of disposing
of criminals without trial, is popular
with taxpayers because of economy
We hae no hesitation in expressing
the opinion, that it is neither
economical nor popular, and further
more that it is unjust and agaiust
the spirit of the law To show how
this'business has grown to serious
proportions hi Amador count}' of
late years, we hae taken the trouble
to examine the records of the su
periorjeourt for the past eighteen
years^ iiding this time into two
periods*one coering from January,
1885, ufitil January, 1893, eight
years; the other extending from
January, 1893, to the present time,
nearly ten years The latter repre
sents the term of office of the present
sheriff, U S Gregory In the tirst
named" period we find 32 criminal
cases entered on the register CJf
these 24 stood trial, and S pleaded
guilty Of those included in the
latter, one case is in doubt, because
the outcome is not^teted in the
register; but we let it stand as a
case of admitted guilt Of the 8
cases two were Chiuamen and one
an Indiau Of the remaining fie
cases, two were represented by at
torneys, leaing ouly three instances
of white men being sent to state
prison without the benefit of an at
torney to look after their interests
Now let us turn to the other
period From January, 1593, to the
present time, the criminal calendar
shows a total of 83 cases — an
aerage of Si per year against four
per year for the precediug eight
years Of these, 39 defendants
aailed themseles Personalof their legal
right to a jury trial by a plea of
not guilty; while 44  were led to
plead guilty As compared with
the first named period, the trial
cases increased about 50 per cent,
while the confessed guilt cases in
creased at the rate of oer 450 per
cent _In other words, under the
present regime, from some cause
or other 4J times as many per
sons~are punished on a plea of guilty
than was the case prior to 1893 It
is also interesting to note that in
nearly all these cases 'of "guffty"
from the lips of the defendant, the
accused has been unrepresented by
an attorney In this regard we hae
not had time to segregate them
Nor can it be truthfully said that
this increase of criminal cases is due,
not so much to iucreased crime, but
to greater diligence and success on
the part of the peace officers m the
ferreting out of crime If anything
the reerse of this proposition would
be nearer the truth It is always
the case, that a large percentage of
crime goes' undetected aud unpun
ished This will coutinue no matter
who is in office All that can be de
manded is that the, peace (officer do
his utmost, without fear or faor, to
unrael crime, and conict the
offender in accordance with law
It is inconceiable that the radi
dal departure in criminal procedure
which we hae outlined "has come
about without cause It is beyond
our proince to look into the secret
springs of the change between the
administration of the present and
the past ' All' we can do is to point
to the record, and let our readers
draw their own conclusions It is
undeniable that a difference is made
in the degree of punishment meted
out to one who pleads guilty and one
who stands trial To illustrate this
we cite one instance Christenson
and Gotaw were charged with grand
larceny committed at Tabeaud reser
oir They were both inoled in
the same affair Christenson was
looked upon as a hard character, and
the head and front of the offense
But he pleaded guilty, aud was gien
two years His companion Gotaw,
concluded to stand trial He was
conicted He got seen years
It is not for us to discuss moties
The object of this policy appears to
be either a morbid desire to popu
late state prisons, or to encourage
defendants to plead guilTyand there
by sae expense of prosecution The
first is unworthy of notice The lat
ter is fallacious Instead of beiii"
< o
economical, it is the most costly, as
well as unjust system that could be
adopted In Sacramento county a
selfconfessed conict is dealt with
on the same plane as one whostauds
trial The result is Sacramento is
pretty well rid of the criminal class
The chronic lawbreaker steers clear
of the county where he knows if de
tected he will receie adequate pun
ishment He prefers to operate
where he will be lightly punished;
een though he has to plead guilty
to secure it He can thereby commit
three crimes and get the punishment
of one, with the chance of escaping
detection altogether In this way
Amador county by the procedure
outlined, offers an asylum for those
confirmed in crime, and judging from
the increase of crime siuce the policy
has been started, they are making
use of its territory as a place of
refuge Voters of Amador county,
it is for you to say whether this
peculiar system shall'take deeper
root here, or be eradicated by dis
soling the political combine" that
has fostered it
THE AMAOU LEPGKEBPersonal JACKSON, CALrFORNIA, FliTf>AY, OCTOBER 24 1902
A PAGE FROM THE PAST
It is being said, in" some quarters
that the office of county clerkPersonal is a
nonpolitical one" Those of that be
lief must be ignorant of Amador's
history in rocent years The fact is,
eery electie office in the couuty —
froin ]udge to constable— is a politi
cal office, and all are used more or
less in a partisan spirit Perhaps
it is unfortunate that it is so But
eery county official is expected to
bestow faor or patronage upon his
party friends, and there can be no
alid objection to this course so long
as it is confined within reasonable
and legal limits There is more
politics in the clerk's office to the
square foot than all otner offices
combined, the sheriff's office alone
excepted The case of wyer s
Garbarini is still fresh in the public
minds 1  V S Garbarini was de
clared elected by the official board of
canassers as superisor i town
ship one, in Noember, 1896 He
won by four otes He was the re
publican nominee, and by taking his
seat the complexiou of the board of
superisors would hae been changed
from democratic to republican He
was gien a certificate of election by
the county clerk The margin was
too small to forgo a contest Suit
was commenced, and at the trial 24
Garbariui oles were thrown out as
illegal, aud wyer was declared
elected by 9 otes It is too long a
story to go into details of the many
reasons why otes were rejected
Garbarini filed a notice of appeal,
accompauied by a bond of costs
On the 4th of January, 1897, V S
Garbarini appeared before the board
and asked the clerk to place his name
on the roll call, as he had a right to
do pending the result of the appeal
Here is what occurred, and we ask
all fairminded citizens to ponder
oer the record here gien, and the
reason assigned for refusing to place
Garbarini's name on the roll The
minutes of the board of that date
read as followsPersonal
 P wyer instructs the clerk to call
his name as a member of the board,
which the clerk refases to do
V S Garbarini asks the clerk if he
has in his possession a certificate ol
election issued to him, said V S Gar
barini as superisor of township one by
said clerk in pursuance of the order of
the board of superisors made No 9,
1596, whereupon the clerk answered
that he had, and identified the certifi
cate of electiou of said V S Garbarini
He stated that it was returned to him
and filed No 17, 1896 V S Gar
barini asked the clerk to read said cer
tificate of election, together with the
endorsement thereon, and then taplace
his name on the roll of the board of
superisors, and to call his name as en
rolled, and to recognize said certificate
of election; whereupon the clerk read
said certificate of election together with
the oath thereon, of said V S Gar
barini, and tho endorsement thereon,
and thereafter refused to place said
name of V S Garbarini on said roll,
or to call the same, or to recog
nize said certificate together with said
oath and endorsement thereon, and
stated his reasons for the same
seen o'clock on the eening of
tho same day, V S Garbarini presents
again the certificate of his election and
official bond, and his qualifications as
superisor, together with the ondorse
mout thereon, and demands that the
clerk recognize the same, and place his
name upon the roll as a member of the
board of superisors elected at> the
election of Noember 3, 1896, which
the clerk refuses to do, and states his
reasons for so doing, to wit, because he
beliees P wyer should hold oer
until V S Garbarini is declared duly
elected by the supreme court of the
state of California
Judgment in case No 1338 wyer s
Garbarini, the certificate of election
and qualifications of P wyer and his
official bond is offered in eidence to
the board of superisors by W J Mc
Gee, attorney for P wyer
The notice of appeal in the case of P
wyer s Garbarini filed January 5,
1597, and the undertaking for costs and
damages on appeal is offered in ei
dence to the board, by John F ais,
attorney for V S Garbarini
After due consideration by the clerk
the name of P wyer is placed upon
the roll of the board, and his name is
called as a member of the board of
superisors, retaining said office as a
holdoer
A person can continue in office as
a holdoer only when a acancy oc
curs by reason of failure to elect, or
of the person elected to qualify It
is^not contended that either of these
conditions arose in this superisor
case It will be noticed that the
clerk would not recognize the Gar
barini certificate as alid, neither
did he take the position that the
wyer document, issued by order of
the superior court, entitled the con
testant to the seat pending decison
by the appellate court Both cer
tificates were ignored, on what legal
grounds we do not know But
wyer's name was called as a hold
oer, which from the standpoint of
practical politics amounted to the
same thing Garbarini was kept
out of the seat, the board was kept
democratic aud one of the main ob
jects of the appeal was thereby de
featedPersonal The record is submitted to
the oters for their calm considera
tion

By the statement of the license col
lector for the quarter ending Sept 30,
1902, which was presented to the board
of superisors at its last meeting, and
published in the Ledger last week, it
will be noticed that no reenue from
theatre or show licenses of any kind
was collected during that quarter No
licenses of this kind were receied from
the auditor, none sold by the collector,
and no unsold licenses roturned to the
auditor We are not aware that the
license ordinance has been amended, so
as to place traeling shows on the free
list We do know, howeer, that for
the month of Sept, theMorell Com
pany played in Plymouth, Amador
City Sutter Creek, Jackson and lone,
staying about a week in each town By
the ordinance, the license for shows is
$250 per night or slo per week If the'

F L Stewart is entitled to the unan

is now 33, and getting older eery day

disposes ol the 'tooyoung' objection
r B T Freshman of Amador City,

qualified in eery way for the office
he seeks, and a gentleman at all

It is needless to remind the peo
ple that Johnny Glute of Volcano is

ship Clute is making a clean,
earnest, and thorough canass, and
meeting with encouragement No
one can truthfully say that he is not
as well qualified for the place by edu
cation, business experience, and in
tegrity as any man in the county
He is young and ambitious He ac
cepted the nomination at the earnest
request of republicans, who were
anxious that this place on the ticket
should be filled by a strong and
actie candidate No man on the
ticket is more desering the solid
support of his party than he The
personal worth of thecaudidate, the
exceptional circumstances under
which he entered the list of nomi

which he tobk up the task, ought to,
and we beliee will, secure the loyal

not a single application was made

BEWARE OF POLITICIANS
It is current talk on the streets of
Jackson that efforts are being made
in the interest of certain candidates
for reelection to secure the support
of the newly organized miners' union
i this couuty Such a course can
only be construed as a dernier re
sort in the face of impending defeat
The union men, whateer be their
numbers, will display their good
sense in' refusing to be drawn into
any such snare in behalf of any
candidate In iew of the history
of tho past, it becomes them to keep
clear of politicians It was the fact
that, officeseekers arlfl politicians
held sway jin • the organization of
thirty years ago, that led to the
terrible scenes that were enacted in
those days The memories of that
period of "strife and industrial panic
are still fresh in the minds of many
now liing, and the causes which set
tho country back for a decade are
well known As an abstract propo
sition — the right of miners or any
other class of workmen, to organize
for mutual benefit can be questioned
But when the support of such unions
is sought for political ends, with im
plied promise of return support if
elected, the matter at once assumes
a serious phase, and the foundation
for trouble is laid By all means
keep out of politics Bar from your
order any man who would lead you
i that direction He is not a friend,
but an enemy If the politician
gomes around, coquetting for your
aid, shuu him, and ote against him
He seeks you out only to make use
of you for his own political prefer
ment His touch means not life,
but death His honeyed words are
not nourishment, but poison More
oer, i the condition of affairs now
existing in Amador county, persons
seeking to form an alliance with the
infant organization, for his own
political aggrandisement, should, be
taboed at the ballotbox not only
by tho union men themseles, but
uonuuiou men also, and by the mine
owners and employers " generally
He ought to be beaten badly, as an
example that such tactics will not
be tolerated under present conditions
in Amador couuty
THE ELER SOTHERN
* Couple of the Celebrated Come
dlan'a Practical Jokes
Many stories are told of Sothern's
original methods of entertaining his
friends at dinner, and possibly the
most amusing is that of the belated
guest \ When, late In the dinner, this
friend waiTMnounced, Mr Sothern ex
claimed, "Lqt us nil hide^ under the
table," and down they all went sae
Mr Sothern himself, who remained
seated When the tardy guest entered,
Mr Sothern rose and receied him
with exquisite courtesy, saying, "When
your name was announced, my guests,
for some unaccountable reason, all hid
under the table" After a few mo
ments of discomfort one by one they
crept out and back to their seats
I heard from both Mr Sothern and
Mrs Vincent this account of an out
burst of fun at a dinner gien by him
la his parlor at the Reere HousePersonal As
the guests, ten in number, were gath
ered about the open fire before dinner
a stout, pompous waiter, afflicted with
short breath, added the last touches to
his dinner table, already spread Ten
large, square pieces of bread were
placed with mathematical precision
pne at each plate, and then he left the
room to bring the wine Mr Sothern
saw his opportunity and, calling his
dog>criedPersonal "Tiger, the bread! Quick,
Tiger!" And the nimble little gray
hound bounded lightly upon the table
again and again as he heard his mas
ter's imperatie "Fetch the bread!' 1
until each piece had been remoed to
a dark corner near the fire
Upon the waiter's return all was si
lence The expectant look upon" Mr
Sothern's face showed only that dinner
waa awaited Standing for a moment,
bewildered, the waiter, seeing no bread
upon the table, hesitatingly turned to
the door, then retraced his 'steps to
the table, examined It carefully and
hurriedly left the room He soon re
appeared with a fresh plate of bread,
and again at each plate a piece was
carefully placed, and he "retired with
the empty plate "Quick, Tiger! Fetch
It again I More bread! More bread!"
And once more each piece was re
moed before the grae waiter reap
peared, and all were again silent 'One
look at the table and one at the
guests, and there remained no doubt
Those poor, hungry actors had eaten
it! With a look of contempt he an
nounced dinner, and after all were
safely seated at the table he brought
a third plate of bread and with a fork
placed It, with a gesture of scorn,
piece by piece for each person and for
the hosf The merry scene soon dis
armed his hostility, and before the
eening was oer the bread In the cor
ner was reealed— Mrs Lucy erby

The first rain of the season com
menced Tuesday afternoon Not for
many years has iho starting in of the
rainy season been delayed so long
Except a slight sprinkle in August —
not enough to measure— we hae had
not a drop of rain for the season until
this week Our weather records do
not show a parallel to such a late com
mencement of winter, although in the
season 189S9 there was less rain up to
Noember 1 than we hae had this
week The rainfall has been sufficient
ly heay not only to lay the dust, but
to start the grass It will no doubt
start the streams in the eastern part of
the county which help to feed the Blue

AN ASTOUNIN6 STATEMENT
etails of a Border Crime Neer Before Pub
lished—A Remarkable Instance of
the FleadGuilty Business /
On the 11th instant we receied a let
from A Maron, postmarked El or
ado, coneying the startling informa
tion that a crime, the scene of which
was alleged to hae been laid in El
orado county, was taken in hand by
the officials in Ainador county, atid the
perpetrator sent to the penitentiary on
a plea of guiliy 'FBe article was in
tended for publication in the interest
of good goernment, with full irmis
sion to append the author's name there
to The case was entirely now to us,
and while realizing at a glanco' the
graity and importance, of the com
munication, the facts were so moagerly
stated that wo decided to await fur
ther particulars Accordingly, wo no
tified our corespondent— who is a por
fect stranger to us— to that effect In
the meantime we made inquiries of par
ties from the mountains who were ac
quainted with the neighborhood of
the crime — which as said to bo about
three miles froraWiley's station, where
the boundary line between the two
counties is unmistakably marked by
the Ainador wasron road The infor
mation thus gained socmod to tally
with the main facts in our correspon
dent's letter In a few days wo receied
the following reply to our request for
further particularsPersonal
El orado, Cal, Oct 20, 1902
A mad or LedgerPersonal — Yours of the 17th
ult, is at hand, and hasten to answer
I gie you herewith all I deem nec
essary in the cattlestealing case of
Lester,
On the 1 18 th of September, 1900, in
the eening, a shot from a ritle was
fired in a westerly direction from where
I then lied, on a homestead claim
situated on Clear creek, better known
as the south fork of the middle fork of i
Cosumnes rier, about 2A miles north I
of the Amador county line, in El o
rado county, on what is known as tho
Bridget Barney place, owned by James
L Barnoy
On the morning of the 19th of Sept
I left my place to find the cause of a
calf bellowing all the night befo'ro As
I neared the Barney place I saw W H
Lester walking toward his home with
a load of something in a sack on his
shoulder I measured his track, aud I
found it tallied exactly with the tneas
urments  I had taken before ' The
smell of blood attracted my dog's at
tention, and I followed him to the spot
where a beef had been cut p — hide
and hair and beef I found the same
tracks there again; ' the heaiest track
or trail led into J L Barney's barn
The door — or at least where the door
had once been — had been heaily bar
ricaded preious to the butchering,
but on the morning in question there
were only a few boards in tho place,
and a few sacks hung oer thorn My
dogs entered the barn, and I came to
the conclusion it was safe for me to
look in On looking in I saw what
looked like a front quarter of a beef
lying on one of the mangers I left
the Barnoy promises after I had noted
the scene of tho butchering, and started
for the Lester place, about a ', of a mile
distant, in a northwesterly direction
When I reached his place I found him
coming from the spring with a pall of
water, with which I saw him after
wards trying to cloan tallow that was
all soiled with dirt and blood Tle
told me he bought a front quarter of
beef from the Pleasant Valley butcher,
and that ho bought the tallow in ques
tionPersonal but no butcher would sell tallow
in such condition I know that I had
one of the parties who butchered a cow
belonging to Allen, or the estate of
George Allen n
As I had seen all 1 needed, I pre
pared to find the herder of Allen, to
find out from him what to do I did
not get to speak to him until the after
noon of September 19, 1900 After I
told him (George Joses) all I knew of
the case, we wont together to J L
Barney's barn and found some of the
beef hid away in the mangers of the
barn, coered oer with hay taken
from the barn Joses left me in charge
of the barn and beef, while he rode to
Sutter Creek to see the boss That
party was gone, so he told me after
wards I cannot tell who gae orders
to Sheriff Gregory to arrest Lester,
but on the next day, the 20th of Sept,
Gregory arrested W H Lester for
cattle stealing in El orado county, in
the presence of myself, G Joses, and
another cattleman, and took him to
Jackson, and landed him in jail there
I claim that Gregory took the law in
his own bands when be kept Lester
there, to get him to plead guilty It
was Gregory's duty to notify the of
ficers of Et orado countyto come and
get the prisoner Instead of that,
Lester was shipped to San Quentin
from Amador county
Gregory appointed me keeper of Les
ter's place 1 was thereby tied hand and
foot A few days after Lester's arrest I
sent a letter to Gregory, telling him of
the finding of some more beef and hides
in the possession of Lester, as well as
some corn beef undoubtedly killed the
summer before I told him in the letter
that it would be wrong to hae Lester
plead guilty, as that would allow his
partner to escape unpunished I am
satisfied that Gregory got my letter ero
he shipped Lester to the penitentiary
Letters which Lester sent from the
Jackson jail tended to proe that ho
was urged to plead guilty, for what pur
pose others are hotter able to answer
than I am It is no hard matter to
proe that at least one other person
not far from'the scene of the crime was
anxious to preent Lester from stand
ing trial, as he was afraid of exposure
It seems to me this is enough, \yill
also gie witnesses in the case if need
be  
Very respecifull, '
A Marox
Upon this showing the case became
sufficiently interesting to lead us to
pursue it further \Ve decided to look
up the records The register of actions |
shows that an information was filed
against W H Lester on September
25, and arraignment same day This
is all The superior court minutes
show that on his arraignment defend
ant declined to hae an attorney; that
he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to
two years in San Quentin It does not
appear that any testimony was taken
either to show the grade of the crime
or to proe jurisdiction We next ex
amined the judgment roll, and found
that the only witness indorsed on the
information or complaint as haing ap
peared before the committing magis
trate was "U S Gregory" That the
crime charged was cattle stealing com
mitted on the 18th of September; 1900,
in Amador county We thereupon
wanted to see the testimony upon
which the accused was held for trial in
Amador county, but in this we were
disappointed The deposition in this
"sole witness" case was not on file
The examination was held before Jus
tice Goldner of Jackson Upon exami
nation of the justice's docket, we found
that the complaint— the substance of
which, is set out in the docket— was
i sworn to on the 24th of September by
i U S Gregory It charp» positiely
' and directly that W H Lester, of the ;
j county of El orado, oti the 18tli day
of September, 1900, at Shake Ridge, in
I thocouoty of Amador, state of Cali j
fornia, committed the crime of felony,
|to wit, grand larceny The said Wil
j Ham H Lester, at the time and place '
I aforesaid, feloniously, did kill, sleal,^
I take and carry away from the moun j
tain cattle range of the estate of George
; Allen, deceased  otic ; iiiw, tho
being then and there the property of,
! the estate of Gro Alleu, deceased] ' i
i Tho defendant was asked whether he
i wautud an attorin' and 'replied thai
jho did not ; Tho taking ilown of the
testimony in short luiuil, whi;h is
j usually dono i f toiiy cases which <ro
; i> trial, was waiud, aud this is tho ex
planation of there being no deposition
on tile The law says that' with the
consent of all parties— the district at
torney, defendant, and court — reducing
of the testimony to writing may ' be
waied So it was satisfactory all
round that the testimony in this case
should not be perpetuated The ex
amination was hold on the 25th— tho
same, day that the matter canto up in
tho superior court U S Gregory was
the, sole witness The law* proides
that' 'a preliminary r examination in
felony cases' cannot bo waied
These aYe the facts from the records
It is needless to comment upon them
No doubt the man killed the cow But
if tho statement of our correspondent
is correct — and he gies the only cir
cumstantial account of the matter that
has appeared in writing— the crime be
longed to El orado county, to look
after This case is a signal illustration
of the dangerous tendency of the"* 'plead
guilty" policy which has grown tto be
such a prominent feature of the courts
of "Amador county '

TWO PERORATIONS
From llny'H Eulogy on HcKlnley and
Blaine'M Eulogy on Garneld
It is a curious coincidence that on
Feb 27, ISB2, and on Feb 27, 1902, a
secrotary of state of a murdered presi
dent deliered a eulogy of  his dead
chief before the houses of congress
Sir Hay, primarily a writer, showed
the essayist in his oration on McKln
loy Mr Blalne, primarily a speaker,
showed the orator in his oration on
GnrfieUL Here Is the peroration of
Hay's eulogy of McKinleyPersonal
There is not one of us but feels prouder
of his natie land because the august fig
ure of Washington presided oer Its be
ginnings; no one but ows It a tenderer
loe because Lincoln poured out his blood
for It; no one but must feel his deotion
for his country renewed and kindled when
he remembers how McKinley loed, re
ered and sered It, showed In his life
how a citizen should lie and In his last
hour taught us how a gentleman could
die 
Blame's oration on Garneld ended
with this famous passagePersonal
As the end drew near ,hls early craing
for the sea returned The stately man
Bion of power had been to him the weari
some hospital of pain, and he begged to
be taken from his prison walls, from Its
oppressie, stifling air, from Its home
lessness and Its hopelessness Gently, si
lently, the loe of a great people bore the
pale sufferer to the longed for healing of
the sea to lie or to die, as God should
will, within sight of the heaing billows,
within sound of Its manifold oices With
a wan, feered face, tenderly lifted to
the cooling breeze, he looked out wistful
ly upon the ocean's changing wonders, on
Its far sails, on Its restless waes rolling
shoreward to break and* die beneath the
noonday sun; on the red olouds of een
ing, arching low to the horizon; on the
serene and shining pathway of the stars
Let us think that his dying eyes read a
mystic meaning which only the rapt and
parting soul may know Let us beliee
that in the silence of the' receding world
he heard the great waes breaking on a
farther shore and felt already upon his
wasted brow the breath of the eternal
morning
THE PARAISE FISH
One o( the Wonderful Piscatorial
Rarities Found In China
The oddest of all piscatorial rarities
is the paradise fish of China Like the
German canary and one or two other
species of bird and fish, this little finny
beauty is the product of cultiation
only, there being no place In the world
where it is found in a wild state In
the land of the dragon they are kept
and cultiated in 'ornamental aquari
ums, each succeeding generation of the
little oddities exhibiting more dier
sified colors The male is the larger of
the two sexes, measuring when full
grown three and a half Inches The
body is shaped ery much like that of
a common pumpkin seed sunfish, its
color surpassing in brilliancy any flsh
heretofore cultiated for the aquarium
The head of macropodus (that's his
generic name) is ashy gray, mottled
with Irregular dark spots The gills
are azxirine blue, bordered with bril
liant crimson
The eyes are yellow and red, with a
black pupil The sides of the body and
the crescent shaped caudal fln are deep
crimson, the former haing from ten
to twele ertical blue stripes, while
the latter is bordered with blue The
upper surface of the body is continual
ly changing color — sometimes "it Is
white, at others gray, black or blue
The dorsal and anal fins are remarka
bly large, hence Its generic name—
macro, large; podus, fin or foot Both
fins are shaped alike and are striped
with brown aud bordered with a bright
blue The dull colored entral fins are
protected by a brilliant scarlet colored
spine, extending threefourths of an
inch behind the body of the fln The
pectoral fins are well shaped, but trans
parent and colorless
MountingPersonal a Horse
 A careful bicyclist learns to mount
from either side of the wheel, since the
emergency may arise at any moment,
says the London Chronicle Ope would
think that the horseman would be
equally careful to proide for possibil
ities and accustom himself to mount
ing indifferently from the off side and
the near side But if he were to en
ture to mount on the right side— which
is the wrong side — in a hotel stable
yard the hostler would probably de
mand the price of a gallon as the
statutory fine, and the horse would col
lapse with surprise What Is the
meaning of this conention? It ap
pears in odd places Not only doea
the trick horse, in the circus canter
from right to left, but the after dinner
wine passes the same way "The way
of the sun" is the current explanation,
which is absurd
WUUngr to Go Without
Henry Clews, perfectly bald, was
once traeling on a western railroad
Sitting directly behind hum was a coarse
looking man with a rough shock of hair
the color of brick dust
Tapping Mr Clews on the shoulder,
the fellow remarkedPersonal
"Guess you wasn't around when they
gae out the hair"
"Oh, yes," was the answer, "but l
was a trifle late, and there was nothing
left but that stuff you wear, so I told
them I'd rather hae none"— New York
