while, and by puttiu in two votes fur
himself, the squar was duly elected.
Deacon Spooner was made referee, and

Joslyn made a speech of acceptance

over fur three or four days, and when
he got up be began withPersonal
"Foller me back to the days of Julius
Cepsar. " When Cjrsar was a young man
of 22. he hadn't a dollar to his name
and no show to strike a job. He bad
about ' made ' up his mind to commit
suicide when , he found a - five dollar
goldplere in the road. His first thought
was to use the money to start In busi
ness, but . It was only a temptation.
His honesty wouldn't permit such a
thing.; He went around inquirln who
bad lost $5. and at.lenKth found the
owner/, and . the. owner; took a likin to
him and pushed him along until he was
finally made a king."
"That's one tally mark fur the affirm
ative side," saUl the deacon as the
speaker 6at down.* "and I decide that
Ebenezer has made five p'lnts. Wo
will 'now bear from Jonas Bebee on
the negative side."
• "Poller me back to the days of Julius

"I object!" protested Ebenezer. "Hav

foller Jonas. I appeal to the referee."
"I. shall have to overrule the objec
tion," said the deacon. "We follered
Ebenezer back, and we must give Jo

anything new about Julius Cccsar, we'd
like to hear it."  •  .
"When Caesar was a young man of
22, he hadn't a dollar to bla name,"
continued Jonas, "and. though he of
fered to dig out stumps fur 15 cents a
day, Personal be couldn't .bit a job.' , He had
made up his mind to hang himself
when' he found a stray mewl In the
woods. He knew be ought to advertise
the mewl and restore him to his owner,
but dishonesty carried the day. He
sold the critter, to the . first man who
would buy, and* with the $12 he re
ceived he went Into politics and pushed
along until he finally became one of the
greatest men of 1 his time. He lived
fur* SO years after stealtn that mewl,

The deacon said the speakln bad best

Bradshaw, who was on the affirmative
aid*, fur his argyment.
'Toiler me back to the days of Julius
Caesar," began Aaron, with a wave of
his hand, but when he had got that fur
both Ebenezer and Jonas tried to yell
him down and appeal to the referee.
"I've got to give Aaron a fair show,"
replied the deacon.  "If he wants to be
follered back to the days of Julius
Caeear, this society has got to tag along
behind him. It's rather a cur'us coin

be follered back to the same man, but

Aaron went on. He bad it that Cas

touraged when he happened to find a
diamond ring in a mudhole. He could
have got an advance of $50 on it at a
pawnbroker's, but he actually  went
hungry fur three days while huntin up
the loser. Struck by such a display of
unselfish honesty, the owner presented
him with $75, took him under bis wing

PROSPERITY STRIKES.
There are two profilic seasons of
•trikes for higher wages among work
ingmen. One is when times are grow
ing harder and employers are retrench
ing in all possible ways, cutting wages
and discharging help, and the other is
when times have become goad and
there has been a general rise of prices
as a result of better times.
Personal It is the misfortune of labor that it is
almost the first to feel the pinch of
tightening times and almost the last to
feel the full effect of a returned pros
perity. .'
" ! When times get . bad labor is dis
charged or * wages are cut very soon.
When times begin to improve labor is
taken on with some alacrity but the ad
vance in wages seldom keeps pace with
the advance in prices. Wages gener
ally have to wait for the establishment
of something like a stablo price level
commensurate with the new order of
things. jpyS|jgS!§3gj£§£psjs
• There is no doubt also a tendency for
employers to '-delay the restoration of
wages, upon the return of better times,
until after they have repaired the dam
age inflicted upon their capital by a
season of hard times.
'i While there are thousands of employ
ers who do the right thing by labor with
out compulsion, and whle hundreds and
hundreds of manufacturing concerns
throughout the country have increased
wages voluntarily, it must be confessed
that there are employers who are not
thus liberal minded and who yield only
to superior force.
| To meet this sort of aggressiveness
on the part of the employer the I em
ployed can only organize themselves into
a union and inaugurate a strike, and so
compel a just share of the joint product
of labor, ability and capital.
And it may be confessed also that
organized labor has/ encouraged by a
spirit of resentment against the en
croachments of capital, sometimes de
manded more than was right or than
could be conceded and have crippled
their cause by making such unwarranted
demands. It is not at all times the case
that only one side is at fault. .
. And yet it may be taken as generally
true that labor has received that meas
ure of reward which it has won for it
self, and very much more.' While de
mand and supply of labor are strong
determining factors the insistance of
organized labor on its rights has lifted
labor as nothing else has lifted it.
The prudent warrior chooses well his
time for going to war. He seeks to
take his enemy at a disadvantage, and
the wise labor organization does the
same. The head of . such an organiz
ation will not order a strike at a time
when labor is superabundant and hun
dreds of unemployed are hunting work.
He will not order a strike when there
is six month's supply of manufactured
product piled up in advance. He will
seize the opportunity, when the de
mand for the product is greatest and
the labor market is scarcest of unem
ployed.
That is why there are strikes in good
times. ; Strikes do not prove that times
are not good. Strikes sometimes occur
at the height of prosperity and often
the highest paid labor is the sort that
strikes and it strikes because it believes
that it is taking capital at a disadvan
tage and the time is therefore favor
able for a forward and upward move*
ment in the cause of men and women
who must. earn there livelihood with
the work of their hands.

dodged behind tbf> curtain to await
developments. The room was very

THEY BUILT THE ROAD.
And Gonld Knew Where to Get <he

Jay Gould once wanted to build a

Smith he gavp Imperative orders, "Get
out as big a force as possible, and com*
plete the road before the other fellows
get wind of it, and we'll head 'em off."
Smith reported presently, "Mr.
Gould, we can get all the ties, fish
plates, bolts, nuts and spikes we want
but we can't get the rails." "Tele
graph to every mill in the country, and
pay any price," Bald Gould. "I hare
done so. and there Is no chance for a
delivery under 12 monthe." "Then,"
said the little wizard, "go somewhere
and tear up something. We've got
to have rails." He indicated the road
to destroy,' a branch or feeder of the
Union Pacific.
Smith soon had the old /road torn up
and the new one laid down. Then
came war. Stockholders of the Union
Pacific learned of the enterprise and
haled Smith to court to answer for
tearing up a railroad that belonged to
them. To their questioning he admit

Gould ordered him to do It

"What has he got to do with It?"

THE TRUST ITS OWN PARTIAL
Personal• REMEDY. •
That thttntlf "problem ' is, a serious
one no Republican will deny, and yet
it presents certain aspects of hopeful
ness to thost who can so far control
their fright as to examine it with calm
ness and reflect on it with fortitude.
The trust is to a considerable degree
self limiting.
The conservatism of bankers and in
vestors has pnt a stop 'to the craze for
trust formation that swept over , the
country a y6 ar or two ago.
It has occurred to thougjhtful people
too, that in so far as the trust is. a nat
ural effort to secure greater efficiency of
production ; by means of a higher degree
of centralization under the direct super
vision of one keen mind and strong will,
it is probably not to be legislated against
with success.'"* V' . ";• ' - PersonalPersonal - -f»Personal'*- < ir'
And, too, if prices are not advanced
an justly . through the workings of a
trust the pnblio law has no rational
ground for interference.
. If, on the other hand,' prices are un
justly advanced the tendency is to cre
ate opposition to the trust by the organ
ization of some powarful competitor.
An unjust  advance of pricqs turns
the attention of consumers to the use
of substitutes for the produot controlled
by a trust and nearly every product j in
the market has a substitute of some
sort. • ;tyv Personal ;';'Personal  ; '
The consumer has another very effi
cacious way of punishing a trust for
an unjust advance of prices. He di
minishes ' consumption, gets along with
less, and the market of the trust is in
juriously restricted. ;,i
There is a limit beyond which the
trust can not go in its oppression of . la
bor, for the dearest labor in the world
is an _ underpaid labor that knows that
it is underpaid. ' .The service it renders
is unwilling and an unwilling service is
always a costly service.'Personal ; .
There is also a limitation to the size
of trusts fixed by the obtainable capac
ity for management. When trusts at
tempt more than the managers can man
age there is a general breakdown and
dissolution of the trust. '
As a matter of fact not one of . the
great trusts recently formed secured en
tire control of any industry. ' Even the
Standard Oil company does not control
production of the 1 oil. but only the re
fining. '
The trusts that have been successful,
and are likely to be permanent, ' are
those that rest satisfied with the econo
mies of concentration under a single
management and are not trying to raise
prices "unjustly or to oppress labor.
Time is,  after all, the best cure of
most ills and some of the evils of trusts*
will work out their own cures, and yet
when these cures shall have been effect
ed there will be enough of evil remain
ing to give profoundPersonal concern to patri
otic men and women and they must
sleep on. their arms that they may be
ready to oppose wrong and* defend
right. .
The foregoing suggestions relative to
the self limiting tendencies of trusts
are made, not with the view of imply
ing ; that trusts are not evils, for they
are, but they have not yet brought our
beloved country to that awful " verge "
that "brink " that " chasm " Personal into
which clamorous politicians are ever
striving to induce people to gaze with
terror. The problem is serious but
serious men will solve it.
But Republicans insist that no prob
lem that ever confronted human society
was ever solved by hysterical clamorj
ing. Before there can be mastery of any
difficulty there must be knowledge and
calm deliberation followed by forceful,
but not intemperate, action. .  ]
The Republican policy is to investi
gate and afterward to educate public
opinion to remedial measures.
The polioy of the new Democracy is
to exaggerate and vituperate and so ex
cite the public to an intemperate zeal
for a self constituted leadership.
Which policy is the more wise and
patriotic is for the wise and patriotic to
determine. f» 4 '-

"I'll tell you why it is," said one of
the best dressers In town the other
day. "It Is because one man brushes
his hat with a stiff bristled whisk, and
the other rubs his softly with a piece
of woolen cloth. The felt of a hat is
such a delicate stuff that a stiff whisk
applied to it has pretty much the effect
that a currycomb or a rake would have
on a suit of clothes. It wears the nap
off, exposing the bare gray foundation
in short order.
"A piece of woolen cloth, rubbed
over a hat with a circular motion that
conforms to the grain, doesn't rub off
the nap at all, but keeps It lustrous
and firm and of good color. I buy one
§2.50 hat a year and rub It each
morning with a bit of flannel. I guar
antee that it outlasts three $5 bats that
are raked and scraped with whisks ev
ery day."— Philadelrjhia Record.

How to Avoid the Terrors of Croup
; and Whooping Cough.
It is useless these days for parents to
worry over croupy children or to have
their rest broken by them. Modern
medical science has robbed these dis
eases of their terrors, just as it has
smallpox and diphtheria. Have this
remedy for any cough or cold always
at hand; simply ask your druggist or
storekeeper for a bottle of Dr. Gill's
Botanic Cough Syrup, or send 25 cents
(stamps) to Scott & Gilbert, San Fran*
Cisco, for trial «ke, prepaid.^.

What waßcs Beauty?
Beauty is made or marred by the blood.
When the blood is impure, the cheek*
grow sallow, the eves dull, the hair loses
its luster. When the blood flows through
the .veins in a pure, rich . current, I the
eyes sparkle, the skin is clear, the com-
plexion beautiful. Women who use Dr.'
Pierces Golden Medical Discovery, find
that it is a genuine beautifier. - By puri-
fying and enriching the blood it {hits a
bloom on the cheek and a brightness in
the eye, which tell the story of perfect
health.
"Having been left weak from fever Ust Oc-
tober, I was under the doctor's care here," writes
Mrs. Alice K. Casebier, of Crawford, Ds wes Co.,
Neb. "I took medicine, but did not seem to
gain very much. I was tired all the time, ha 4
no appetite, had wandering pains all over sat '
more or less, and was very nervous, as 1 had
been sick all the summer. I was all run-down
and didn't know what ailed me. I got advice
from Or. Pierce, telling me my symptoms btittr
than I could describe Ihtm myuff, and also telling
me that I would have to take care of myself, and
how to take the medicines. 1 1 took four bottle*
of ' Golden Medical Discovery,' and five of ' Fa-
vorite Prescription,' and gained strength right
along. I took one bottle of tbc 'Pleasant Pel-
lets,' also. I know that these medicines will do
all that they are recommended to do." -

SOMETHING ABOUT MR. SPROUL'S SPEECH.
..The speaker commenced by the assumption made in all
the anti-imperialism speeches of Democratic orators, namelyPersonal
That the Republican administration was attempting to over
ride the Constitution. This assumption is always made
; guardedly and not put in the form of a distinct assertion, lest
c '; t the. hearer might ask what particular Article and Section of
the Constitution was being violated, and the utter hollowness
and falsity of the assumption become apparent. The speaker
did not attempt to quote any part of the Constitution or show
in what manner it had been ignored. It is fair to suppose
that he does not kndw that document well enough to quote it
off-hand, that he has not referred to it since the beginning of
this campaign" and that his oration is simply an echo of the
louder mouthings of that chief of political fakers, William J.
Bryan. The fact is that none of them have pointed, and none
of them can cite~a single clause of the Constitution that has
not been faithfully obeyed by that wise, able, conscientious pa
triot and statesman, William McKinley. Mr. Sproul had the
impertinence to calltipon Repub'licansHo abandon
their life-long 1 principles and their trustworthy^ leaders and
administer a rebuke to the present administration with ..no
other reason' for their action than this baseless, unproved and
unprovable assumption of the Bryan humbuggery. Life-long
Republicans are not subject 1 to any such hallucinations.
They know'Ybat. the immortal Lincoln was assailed by the
same party.in exactly the same. terms that are now applied to
Wm. -McKinley. — ; - - -i, .
•In regard ; to Personal what shall be done with the Philippines.
First, it is no part of the President's duty, to decide the ques
tion, for it belongs to Congressj'and,* secondly^ the Uime lias
not arrived at which any man can .tell what our duty and
honoris, a nation may require us to 'do. v Our President, who
followsjstrictly the line of duty, has wisely and firmly refused
to gratify the Bryanites by making a premature declaration
of policy which would neither be in his province nor power to
enforce, and which might become untenable at any time by a
chdngejof conditions.' Hence, as the Administration has re
fused, to frame any politicaljssue in regard to the Philippines,
leaving thatTquestioii to the sovereign people, and their repre
sentatives in Congress, "where it belongs,, these doughty Dem
ocratic, champions are compelled to sally forth, like Don
Quixote, and charge against windmills, even though erected
by themselves, but exhibiting some sy mtoms of sanity by us
ing the appropriate ammunition, namely, wind. -Personal" This bogus
bogie, conjured .up from the vasty depths, is used to divert the
attention of .the, people from the reaUissues.to -be decided at
the. next ►election. And as the gentleman failed to, cite the
Constitution in support of his first assumption] hePersonal is
unable to outline the policy of President McKinley or that of
Wnf/J. Bryan in regard to so-called imperialismPersonal Upon re
flection, his hearers find themselves, upon both points, with
no additional information, . The gentleman admitted, how
ever, 'that 'Republican' orators are able to adduce as many
reasons for what has been done in^the Philippines as there
are£peaker£> on 'their platform throughout the country, and
the fact ithat'he utterly, failed to refute any of them indicates
that all-6f the vast number uiay be^good reasons. , ;
.-.As a basis of his tirade against the administration Mr.
Sproul stated that the insurgent forces entered the city of
MSmla jide by side and step by step with the United States
army, and declared it to be a of history. Every well
informed person ik'nows* that his statement is not true; on the
coniVary n the insurgent, horde of were prevented by
GenY Wesley Merritt from entering Manila as an armed force
at all, "and for the all-sufficient reason that their only object
in getting'in was to* plunder, the 'city and massacre its inhabi
tants, and this nation could not afford to permit such an out
rage and, stand disgraced before the whole civilized world as
aiding and abetting such fiendish barbarities. Now what be
comes, of .an argument, bassed on s a premise that is utterly
THE AMADOB LEDGER; JACKSON, CALtFOByiA, FBHjAY, OCTOBER 19, 1900.
false. The truth is that Aguinaldo's quarrel with
Merritt began then and there, and from that day . forward he
was planning and preparing treacherously to attack and de
stroy our forces in order that he might accomplish his das
tardly purpose of revenge and plundef.>
Under the treaty with Spain the United States assumed
inviolable obligations to the civilized people of those islands,
and the presence of our army there, and all that has -been,? is
being, or will be done, is amply justified by the -necessity of
protecting those civilized people from being exterminated ,by
barbarians. •;;'-_/.•-,-•;,-.',.
MrPersonal Sproul argued at length upon the ability of this
country to remove the flag from any place where Bryan
thought it was not advisable to keep it. Of course it is ad
mitted that the country is big enough to remove the flag, if
the country agrees with Bryan in regard to the expediency of
doing so, but very few patriotic Americans will vote for a man
who, if elected, would, as Commander-in-Chief of the army,
order our valiant forces to pull down the flag and turn their
backs to a triumphant horde of savages who would follow
themPersonal with shouts of derision and deadly bullets from Mauser
rifles, and thus violating sacred treaty obligations, exposing
innocent and helpless people to plunder and massacrejand
incurring national disgrace and a stain upon the froAor of the
flag, which time could never efface. •'-••..  • <1 Personal
Mr." Sproul promises, if elected to Congress, to.t(y to i-top
the Philippine war for one day in order to save money for an
appropriation to store waters in the high Sierras' toPersonal be used
for irrigation aud other purposes, in the Second "Congression
al District.- Now, Mr. Sproul says that he is primarily a
Democrat; that he distinctly promises to vote on all political
questions with the Democratic party. If, unfortunately, a
majority of his kind should be elected. to Congress, one of
their first acts will be to reduce the tariff-to a free trade, basis
and in a few months the treasury will be depleted, bankrupt,
as it, was under the Wilson Bill, and it will then become im
possible to either carry on the war or prosecute internal im
provements at national expense. The vision of great reser
voirs of life-giving fluid, which causes two blades of grass to
grow where" one grew before, or two mills toj run where one
was before, under Democratic free trade auspices, is
evidently an iridescent dream. No such, benefactions can
come from such a source. ,' "--'Personal
FRED L. STEWART.
The more the matter of Assemblyman is talked, over by
the people of Amador couuty, the stronger the general senti
ment grows that a lawyer can do much better service for the
people in the Legislature than a doctor, and as it. is. service
we want; it is Personal natural to believe the voters of the Fifteenth
District will send Mr. Stewart to Sacramento. - There is an
other important reason why Mr. Stewart should be elected.
During the next session of the Legislature, legislation rela
tive to a uniform series of State text books for use in the
public schools will be had, and, as a lawyer, Mr. Stewart will
be competent to draft the law, or to inspect it and point out
any imperfections that may occur.therein, should some doctor
or other member, not a lawyer, preseut.it. In short, ;while we
are about it, fellow voters of Amador county, why not elect a
man thoroughly competent in education, legal learning and
forensic ability to cope successfully with lawyers Personal of other
Assembly districtsPersonal This election is not simply to compliment
some good citizen, and politically pat him on the back because
he is a good fellow. It is important business for Amador
county, and it is the business and interest of every; voter to
send the man to the Legislature who by training and education
is best fitted to fill the position. Fred L. Stewart is the man.
HONEST WM. TAM.
As the ciimpaign progresses, Wm. Tarn, Republican
candidate for Supervisor.for this township, gains in strength.
Everybody says he is strictly honest, that he is an excellent
debater and has the courage of his convictions no matter who
his opponent may be. That he will not be swerved from
what he considers for the very best interests of his district, no
matter what may be brought to bear upon him, is the opinion
of all who know him. If he is elected, he will represent the peo
ple himself. He will not be the mouthpiece of another. We
want Supervisors with backbone and stamina sufficient to
stand up for the rights of the people they represent. We
want Supervisors who are competent to stand up during
Board sessions if necessary and intelligently argue a point.
Men who can talk, and talk to the point. Wm. Tarn is a
good talker. He makes his influence felt in the. different
lodges and orders in which he is prominent, and his judgment
is excellent. , If Wm. Tarn is elected he will make one of the
most competent Supervisors Township No. 1 ever had. Elect
him; Personal
* The Republican voters and many of the Democratic vot
ers of Amador county have decided that this county has been
controlled by the Democratic party long enough for one .inn
ing. They believe it is not conducive to good government to
have either political party remain in power too long. Cor
ruption might creep in after a time; the dominant party
might become arrogant, self-willed and domineering. This
possibility the voters of Amador county propose to prevent by
paving the way for a change of administration of county af
fairs two years hence, and to do this it will be a step in the
right direction to secure a Republican majority of the Board
of Supervisors. This will undoubtedly be accomplished, as
all three of the Republican candidates for Supervisor, namely,
Wm. Tarn, Wesley M. Amick, and E. B. Moore, stand an ex
cellent chance of election. They are all good men; honest,
upright, careful and conservative. They will serve their re
spective districts with ability and give satisfaction to all con
cerned. They are business men, and business men we.fmust
have on the Board. Now is the opportunity. to get in the en
tering wedge that will split the Democratic party in twain two
years hence. Hit that wedge a lick, fellow voters.
If one will take the pains to read the political history of
1864, one will ascertain how shamefully the Democrats
abused Abraham Lincoln, and yet they now pretend to love
his memory, and audaciously invite Lincoln Republicans to
vote for Mr. Bryan.

EL DORADO COUNTY.
NuggetPersonal The river-bed mine at Sal
mon Falls, which was being developed
by Messrs. Drew. Cohn and Donnelly,
has been abandoned. After spending
quite a sum of money the enterprising
g%ntle.m.en found tha^ they were, de
veloping a worked-out claim. The
bed of the river was covered with
several feet of debris, and there was no
indication on the surface that the river
bed at that point had ever been worked
but when bedrock was reached various
mining implements were found instead
The Church mine, one of the best
known mines in El Dorado county," Is
again the scene of activity. It has
been bonded by C. J. Garland of Oak
land, and men associated with him.
Mr. Garland is one of- the most noted
miners of the State. The Church has
been closed down for something over
two years. The shaft has been sunk
to a depth of 1000 feet and the ore . ex
tracted was ' worked in a ten-stamp
millr A wide ledge' of low-grade ore
had been encountered, and it was
found that it would be necessary to
have a larger mill and a heavier hoist
to work the mine most profitably. The
present operators are unwatering ),he
mine and they will increase the plant
to any required . proportions. . - The

California's Superior Display.
William H. Mills, Land Agent of the
Southern Pacific Company, who , went
to Paris last spring to take charge of
the railroad's exhibit there, returned
to, this city last evening. Mr.' Mills is
enthusiastic on what this State has ac
complished at the big Exposition, and
says that the superior display is ad
mired and commented upon not only by
Parisians, but by all Nations of the
world. In only one ' particular did he
find that any other* Nation had out
done California in respect to its natural
resources. Mr. Mills discovered that
the Servian walnut was superior to any
of California's walnuts, and in order
that Servia i should not again outdo
California, he obtained a number of the
nuts and will see that they are added
to this State's product hereafter.
Said Mr. MillsPersonal "The United States
doesn't appear at its best In the Paris
Exposition. . There. is apparently no
high imilligence it the head of affairs.
We had no chemical products displayed
and in this particular line we are known
to excel. We have a miserable, impov
erished exhibition of iron and steel."
- Mr. Mills says he has lost faith in the
significance of gold and silver medals.
He found that out of 75,531 . exhibits
there have been 42, 790 medals given out
in addition to 50,000 diplomas, so it is
not always merit that is honored by
medals. .. % - ;
Mr.' Mills, like others who have been
to the Exposition, does not speak very
kindly of the treatment shown Ameri
cans in, Paris.. The hotel rates were
exorbitant up jto within a' month ago
when tho owners discovered that it
would be to their advantage to . keep
the rates down. ;"! For a time the high
rates kept many people away. During
the latter part of July and the first
part of August, the daily attendance
dwindled down to only 108,000, which
was about 300,000 less than the daily
average anticipated by the manage
ment. California's exhibit, Mr. Mills
says, has attracted more than the av
erage amount of attention. — San Fran

iGroh Discharged.
Richard Groh of Sutter Creek, was ex
amined Friday, Oct. 5, before U. S. Com
missioner R. Webb| on a charge of vio
lating the postal law in having taken a
letter addressed to Clara Bakeweli be
fore the same had been delivered to the
said Clara Bakeweli, with intent to ob
struct the correspondence and pry into
her. secrets. R. C. Bole represented
the defendant. Case for the United
States was conducted by the examining
Commissioner. • U. S. Marshal Shine
and Post-office I nspector Culver were
present. '* The evidence was very con
flicting/ llt seems that the letter In
question had been taken from the post
office by a boy named Louis Socal, who
was authorized by Clara Bakeweli to
receive her mail and convey it to her.
On his way home he told Groh that he
had the letter, and at Groh's request
handed the letter voluntarily to him,
Groh saying that he would take it up
to her. The complaining witness said
she has never received the letter.
Groh said he gave her the letter the
following day, and he was somewhat
corroborated by other witnesses. The
Commissioner deemed the evidence un
sufficient to warrant holding him for
trial, and tho defendant was discharged.
This is the first examination held before
the U. S. Commissioner in Amador
county. ; x.--

Teachers' Institute.
Superintendent Geo. A. Gordon has
decided not to call a teachers' institute
until some time in February, 1901, and
possibly not during the present school

of all conversant with them, including
State Superintendent Kirk. There
has been great irregularity in the open

In honor of Jo D. Sprout, Democratic
candidate for' Congress, the Democratic
ladies of Jackson decorated Love Hall
very tastefully. The ladies performed
their part well- and deserve unstinted
commendation.*.
The rally was . held last Saturday
evening, Oct. 13, and is pronounced by
Democratic leaders to be the • largest
and most enthusiastic, meeting Mr.
Sproul has had in the county. - If that
Is the case, but very little can be said
for previous meetings for, all told, . not
to exceed 125 to 150 Democratic voters
were in the hall, and they invariably
left tbe cheering and  applause to the
irrepressible snair-drum and tbe women
and  children. As for. reat, political
enthusiasm, there was none; and the
reason for its absence was apparent.
Nothing occurred to provoke it. No
reasonable voter could warm up and
cheer during Mr. Sproul's labored
effort. His speech was not up to ex
pectations; it was rather disjointed at
times and may fairly be characterized
as a concatenation of extremely weak
assertions. He was also lame when at
tempting to quote recent  history, and
his sugar-beat calamity -for | California
was so far-fetched that the mot>t ardent
Democrat in the hall actually gave him
a look of pity. But as we have referred
to his speech editorially we will pass to
Dr. Adams, who really acquitted him
self qnite well. "• He said just enough
and he left a good impression on his
hearers. Dr. Adams is, however, so
thoroughly a Democrat, so intensely
partisan, that ho will be a difficult
man-to elect to tho Assembly. - His
lark of legal knowledge is also against
him, and as he is known to be a very
good physician,' the people of Amador
have concluded to let well enough alone
and not spoil a good doctor by making
an indifferent - legislator. For this
great consideration on the part of the
pedple, Dr. Adams will no doubt hearti
ly thank them when the heat of politi
cal discussion shall have died out.
Hon. A. Caminetti closed -the meeting
with a few remarks on the Chinese ex
clusion act, which to a lay member ap
peared rather . too Irrelevant » and
shadowy to cut much ice ; for Mr.
Sproul or anyone else. - Judge -R. C.
Rust, the chairman of the evening,
presided with dignity and made a very
neat and appropriate opening speech.
His introduction iof Mr. . Sproul was
hearty and exceedingly warm, possibly
a trifle too much so,  but *we all have
our friends, and can readily excuse the
Judge if he erred on the side of affec
tion. The singing by the choir, music
by the band and solos, were all enter
taining and really made the meeting
quite enjoyable for the 150 Republicans
present. /

Republican Club.
The Jackson Republican Clnb held a
business meeting last Monday evening
and received the reports of the various
committees appointed to look after the
preparations for the great Republican
Rally to be held here next Wednesday
evening, Oct. 24, at which time Hon.
S. D. Woods, Republican nominee for
Congress, will address the people on
the political issues of the. day. The
committees have nearly everything in
readiness for a torchlight procession,
fireworks, booming of giant powder,
music, bonfires, etc., etc. 'If the
weather is favorable, Jackson will Personal get
a rousing political demonstration,
probably one of the best ever held here.
The meeting of the Club was a good
one, and after the business in hand had
been disposed of, Senator John F.
Davis and Fred L. Stewart made brief
but timely remarks, which were re
ceived with cheers. The veteran torch
ligbtmanipulator, patriotic campaigner,
Thomas Greenhalgh Esq., was present
and gave advice, punctuating his re
marks with spicy reminiscences relative
to other campaigns.
The meeting adjourned to meet in
Webb Hall, Monday evening, Oct. 22,
at 7Personal30 sharp. j
Is Now a Republican.
One evening last week two of Jack
son's most prominent citizens were en
gaged in conversation, the subject being
politics.
One of the men is a pioneer of this
county being over 70 years of age, and
at one time had extensive land hold
ings in this neighborhood. He saidPersonal
"I cast my first vote in 1848, and al
ways voted a straight Democratic
ticket, until four yeras ago]Vhen I
voted for William McKinley,. and if
spared until next election I shall vote
the Republican ticket from'; top to
bottom."
This . statement goes to show that
men who have seen the good and bad
of the several administrations of the
past half a century, realize the 'superi
ority of Republicanism, over Democ
racy, and are giving their support to a
Republican administration, which
means that the United States will be
favored with four more years of pros
perity.
Fruit Growers' Convention.
The twenty-fifth State Convention of
Fruit Growers of California will con
vene at San Francisco, in Pioneer Hall,
under the auspices of the State Board
of Horticulture, on Tuesday, December
4, 1900, and continue in session four

. ton Eloquently Address the
Assembled Bepublicans.
(From Calaveras Prospect.)
. The Republican rally at Angels Wed
nesday evening. was most enthusiastic
and the reception tendered to our next
Congressman, Hon. S. D. Woods, was
most gratifying and satisfactory.  Not
only was Angels out in force to greet
the • distinguished speakers ' but . the
neighboring towns sent full delegations
as well. So that Dolllngs Hall was
well filled by the . hour announced for
the speaking -
Hon. S.. D. . Woods,. Hon.- John F.
Davis and W.C. Ralston had been an
nounced as the speakers of the evening.'
Long before the hour for the meet
ing to open, -an enthusiastic 'crowd
gathered in the street and about the
hotel , anxious ito greet - the Personal popular
Republican candidate, and the Angels
bafld lent its aid to stir ' the patriotism
of the people.
• At the hall the President of the
Angels Republican Club, Mr. Douglas,
presided, and with him on the stand in
addition to the speakers, were the fol
lowing Vice-PresidentsPersonal ,

The Angels glee club opened the pro
gram with a rousing song and the in
terval between speakers, and at the
close was filled with campaign and
patriotic songs from these really excel
lent singers. • .' .
Mr. Woods was the first speaker and
for about an hour and a half he held
the closest attention of his audience as
he discussed clearly . and logically the
issues of the campaign. -The speaker
was clear and forcible- impressing his
hearers with his sincerity. •_ There was
none of the clap trap of the demagogue
but all his assertions were based on the
record, and his deductions were drawn
from clearly stated premises. , He ; was
frequently interrupted by applause,
and at the close was treated to . an
ovation. . • . •
Mr. Ralston followed in - a short ad
dress confining himself mainly, to local
questions and his own interests in . the
campaign.'.' The applause which greet
ed his appeapance, showed the appreci
ation of his friends and neighbors for
the legislative candidate.
Hon. John. F. Davis was the last
speaker, and as he arose to address the
meeting, was given a perfect ovation,
the audience rising and cheering, and
for over an hour he held his audience
with one - of ;- the ' best speeches ever
heard .in Angels. Judge Davis is a
favorite here and never lacks ' for an
abundance of applause to encourage
him in his efforts. "His speech . was a
sound argument for the patriotic
course of the administration and
brought out in strong light the great
work that has been done by McKinley.
Club Notes.
The beautiful floral tribute from the
Republican Club, placed on the grave
of the late R. J. Adams, was purchas
ed by contributions from a few of the
members, and not by * the campaign
fund.
John R. Francis, who was empower
ed to purchase Rough Rider bats for
the parade, has ordered about fifty,
we believe.
• . The report of the committee on reso
lutions, in memory of the late R. J.
Adams, was unanimously accepted and
ordered spread in full upon the book
of record of the Club. -
The entertainment committee has
everything arranged for the great
rally of the 24th. The committee for
pocuring music has secured the Jack
son Band for the S. D. Personal Woods' meet
ing and also for the last meeting of the
campaign to be held here Monday
night, Nov. 5.
I The reception committee will send
one of its members to lone to escort
Hon. S. D. Woods to Jackson on the
afternoon of Oct. 24th.
Hon. Saml. Shortridge will probably
deliver his great speech in this county
during the campaign.
Hon. John F. Davis will be the prin
cipal speaker at the wind-up meeting
to be held here Nov. 5. He wall also
speak at Volcano during the campaign.
It is possible that Senator Perkins
may be able tor address the people of
Amador. county before the campaign
closes." » •.
Prepare foi^a rousing meeting next
Wednesday night. Let every Republi
can help to make it one that he will be
proud of.

At the end of every legislative session
the Supreme Court has to upset more

and this state of affairs is largely due
to the fact that the legislators who en
acted the law were unfamiliar with
legal matters. Vote for Fred L. Stew

difficulty as far as the Fifteenth Dis

lived in Amador county nearly all his

-; William McKinley. isn't by any means

to be charged with '.'lmperialism.", -In
fact, it turns out that this bugaboo has
been resurrected from the campaign of
1832.- •> Andrew 'Jackson,  '- the ' high
priest and idol of Democracy,' was the
imperialist of those days. His oppon
ents were sure that President Jackson's
re-election would put an end to . this
country's existence as a republic, and
the bare thought of his success threw
them into fits.  He was certain to make
himself Emperor, or King, or ," First
Consul, or something of that sort;
. So -as to impress people with the
danger • confronting  them, the . anti
imperialists of 1832 scattered broadcast
ovor.the country posters showing, Mr.
Jackson in his royal robes,  wiping hia
feat on the Constitution of the United
States and trampling on the Bank of
the United States. '"'•  •' .< ;

Death of Daneri.
; James Daneri, 45 years old, a native
of Italy, night ; foreman at ; the Baliol
mine, was killed at 4 o'clock last Sun
day morning.- .
Coroner Gritton held an inquest on
the body of the deceased Sunday after
noon, and the evidence shows that Mr.
Daneri, who was crippled somewhat in
his feet,' went down the shaft from the
700 level to the chute about 25 feet
below, and got on front of the skip at
that point with his back to the foot wall.
He then instructed the skip tender,
Mr. Bonney, to ring him up to the 300
level, the signal for which is 3-d and 1
bells. Bonney reached across the shaft
and pulled the bell wire 3 times and a*
he started to give tbe rest of the signal
the skip started.' Daneri attempted to
get on the right side of ; the skip but
struck the center brace and dislocated
his neck. Mgg^pßßgßapngsM
Engineer CO. Mitchell testified that
he only heard one bell, and,' presuming
a load of waste was to be hoisted, he
started the engine. The bell was tested
in the presence of . the jury and Personal rang
every , time the ' bell-cord Personal was pulled.
It was thought that possibly Bonney,
in reaching across the shaft to give the
signal,  might not have . pulled Personal hard
enough to ring the bell. It was further
shown that the signal code forbids any
one getting on the skip until  the pre
liminary bells are given. In all prob
ability, had Mr. Daneri observed this
requirement, or <Jbad he boarded - the
right side of the skip to ascend, the ac
cident would not have happened. The
shaft was shown to be in good order,
hence the verdict of the jury exonerated
all parties from blame,* and found that
death was caused by accident.
I James Daneri was a pioneer of Sutter
Creek and had many friends there.

Bryan at Milwaukee, Sept. 8.
Mr. Bryan has stated the case above
yrtth unusual fairness, but immediately
used the statement to create
an unfair inference— that the Republi.
pan party had suddenly changed its
tonvictJons a declaring for the gold
standard. '
The Republican party has always fa
yoted tl\6 ootlblS, gold and silver, stand
atfd'fts a preferrM theory of money.pro
vided thai It could be made a world
standard so as to be an effective stand
ard. ;It has not believed that anything
less than the hearty co-operation of all
the civilized nations could result in es
tablishing and maintaining a true bi
metkyc standard of values, and, in
189§> It therefore declared its uneqnivo
£«J ft^position to the free coinage of sil-
T *r «tfi»P* ty international agreement.
Mr.TSryin's party thought, or pre
t«flfled to think, ana it still thinks, or
jpretends to think, that this country can
of itself establish and maintain any
monetary standard it is pleased to have.
The Republican' party believes that
any attempt to' establish a bimetallic
monetary standard In this country by
jbhis country alone would result in es
tablishing the single silver standard and
between a single silver standard and
a single gold standard.it prefers the
better and not the worse of the two
jmetalß. \ 
3%t>ml iiiitf in 1§96 was whether
th[jTtcoTlfftry tfftld rule the financial
!«srldin establishing a monetary stand
ard or .would have to conform to the
Usages of the civilized world in that re
gard.
Th* people, at the polls, by a very
heavy majority, voted to conform t»
the standard established by the civilized
srorld and against attempting the haz
ard of trying to force the world to our
way of thinking, and the monetary
plank adopted by the Republican con
vention at Philadelphia was a formal
acceptance of the gold standard alter
native. In other words it was a declar
ation to conform to the world's monetary
idta after the world had refused to con
form td jour monetary idea.
On the -contrary Mr. Bryan and his
party still Insiit.that, if the' people will
enly give them a chance to try, they
can butt the world off the financial
stage. The Republican party admires
their pluck but condemns their discre
tion. They give evidence of having more
bravery than brains, more ardor than
common sense.
Jf this new Democracy were a Jeffer
lonian Democracy it would accept the
verdict of 1896 as final, for the corner
stone of Jefferson's political philosophy
was the right of majority to rule, but
it is to bd hoped that the verdict of
1900 will be so conolusive as to convince
even the Bryan enthusiasts that the
Ameircan people* have not thrown their
discretion to the winds, but are the
same prndeflt, common sense people
that they were in the days of the fath

WHEN PEACE WILL COME.
',' When the men of our nation cease
to give aid and comfort to our enemies,
peace will come to the Philippines." —
Theodore Roosevelt, at Pocatello, Idaho.
And that is fact - > . ;i
The United States commissioners in
the Philippine islands forewarned the
American public that hostilities would
break out afresh on the approach of the
•ational election, and their prophecy,
has been fulfilled. Two score of soldier
flead have just been offered up on the
(Itar of Mr. Bryan's bogus issue of im
perialism.....  .. . .
; This is not a pleasant thing to con
template. ' It has been definitely known
ever since Mr. Bryan ' promulgated his
imperialistic proclamation' on the 16th
of December, 1898, that the pro-Fili
pino utterances of himself and his
associates constituted the backbone of
the insurrection, and yet with this
knowledge staring him full in the face
he did not hesitate to persist to make
his campaign on the issue that was
bolstering up opposition to national au
thority and costing the lives of our na
tion's soldiery.
Mr. Bryan is certainly an indomit
able man. '
A' man who would, if he could, ride
into the presidency over the graves of
the ' defenders of his country's honor
and not give - evidence of signs of
shrinking, of sorrow, of remorse, would
become a Cesar if he lived in a time
likely to produce Osesarism which, hap
pily, Mr. Bryan does not.
Patriots have found it sweet to die
for their country, but it can not add
sweetness to death on the battlefield to
reflect in the closing, agonizing hours
that if the people at home were only of
one mind, one heart and one measure
of 'political integrity the bloody sacri
flee would not be required. , ,
The Filipinos have slain their scores
but what the San Francisco Examiner
has fitly characterized as a " narrow,
stupid and purblind policy of unrea
soning opposition to whatever Republi
cans undertake, even though it be Jef
fersonian and Democratic in character,"
has slain its hundreds of the bravest
and best.
All the disinfecting perfumes of the
western winds can not, in this Filipino
business, make the hands of W. J. Bry
an smell sweet.
AffOTHBR BUO-A-800.
The San Francisco Examiner has
raised the scare that President's Mc-
Kinley's health is threateningly poor
and that, if he should be re-elected to
office he will not be likely to live out the
full term of office and then, horrible
thought! Theodore Roosevelt would
succeed him.
3 Ths Personal Examiner editor is certainly a
freak.' One wonders what museum he
can have escaped from. "Have you seen
Bosco?," as the spielers cried in front of
the 'snake eater's tent at the ftockton
fair. Since his snakes have been at
tached and taken from him it is possible
that he may have sought refuge in the
editorial rooms of the Examiner.
President Mckinley is not in feeble
health. While he has had a more try
ing experience than any president since
Lincoln he la a life member in good
standing of the "Don't Worry Club,"
and | the strain of office does not hurt
him as it wonld a smaller man. .
But, if in the) providence of God, it
should transput that President Mc-
Kinley might not survive his second
term of office it will be a comfort to the
American people ' to know that he will
be succeeded by a brave, honest, enter
prising j and , manly man in the very
heyday of manful vigor, enured to hard
ship and skilled in statecraft.
Now look on the other picture. Sup
pose that Mr. Bryan were to unhappily
talk himself into a hopeless invaildlsm
and pass to his fathers before he had
long occupied the presidential chair and
were to Personal be succeeded by that ancient
and honorable survival of a superceded
Democracy, Mr. Adlai E. Stevenson.
The ; expectations of longevity in Mr.
Bryan's case, in view of his consuming
ambition for possession of the presiden
tial Office and the wear and tear of the
campaign he is making for it, are not
to be preferred to the expectations of
Mr. McKinley, in view of his calm
faith in the prudence and wisdom of
the American ' people and the trained
ease with which he handles .great affairs.
What sort of President -would AdliE.
Stevenson make?
It is altogether unliktely that the
reader ever soberly asked himself that
question. It is hot pleasant to think of
Mr. Stevenson in connection with the
presidential office* yet.-Brjfen is not im
mortal,
Four years; ago the vice-presidential
nomination oJf the P6po(oratic party was
bartered for; a oeeuniarjy equivalent for
the honor conferred. This time that
nominationPersonal was conferred upon Mr.
Stevenson, that there might be some
thing Democratic somewhere in connec
tion with 'a paramount Bryamism.
And the event has proven that even
from this point of view the selection
was not altogether a happy one.' A
copperhead in the days of his counta-y's
peril,' a greenbacker during the Personal fiat
craze of the seventies, a Gold Democrat
during Mr. Cleveland's administration
and nothing whatever at all ever since,
his Democracy is neither Jeffersonian in
quality nor Jacksonian in aggressive
ness.
The Bryanisfic nominee for the vice
presidency is unexceptionable* if viewed
as a statuesque relict to sit in innocuous
state in the vice-presidential chair, but
when one comes to contemplating Adli
as a presidential possibility, it seems
very much like abolishing the presiden
tial office.

j~?jV'.'
Two removes from the Saviour of
men. One remove from the putative
father of Democracy, Thomas Jefferson,
the partisans of Mr. Bryan have come
to hold in revered estimation Republi
cans a long time dead. They love to
contrast jj the Republicans of our day
with the Republicans of ! yore. They
venture to affirm that the mantle of
Lincoln hasPersonal fallen upon Bryan, and
they would doubtless like to have the
people infer that the toga which en
twined the form of Roscoe Oonkling
now adorns the ample proportions of
Mr. Bryan's chief lieutenant, Riohard
Oroker, of New York City politics;
that James Q. Blame lives again in the
person. of. Charles A. Towne,'Personal that
Charles Suinner is reincarnate in Bailey
of Texas, that Grant, lives again in
Jones of Arkansas, John A. Logan in
Altgeld of Illinois, and Dick Yates in
Stephen M. White of California. But
their chiefest love is bestowed upon
Abraham Lincoln, as well it may be.
So long as the big and little lights of
the new Democracy keep before their
eyes in admiring veneration the great
and glorious dead who gave their lives
to the nation, through service in the Re
publican party, we need not despair of
their Americanism or their economic
and political salvation.' No man ever
loved Lincoln who was not himself
worth trying to save.
• . • . •
But there are men who read Holy
Writ, not that they may find things
good and profitable for doctrine, but
that they may discover ' things to cavil
at and that they may find proof texts to
justify bad causes. There are reasons
for suspecting that Mr. Bryan has been
searching the scriptures of Lincoln in
quest of proof texts to bolster bad causes
and not that the life of Lincoln might
illume the soul of Bryan. Lesser lights
in the new Democracy have been fol
lowing their champion's pernicious ex
ample. This is irreverent, unfortunate
and dishonest. It is irreverent because
it tends to weaken the influence of the
sublimest figure in modern history. It
is unfortunate because it stands betwixt
the men who do it and economic salva
tion. It is dishonest because it sets
snares for the feet of the. people who
put their trust in Bryan and his parti
sans and may bring evil upon them.
The conduct of these men merits right
eous condemnation.
* • •
They quote Mr. Lincoln as declaring
that all men are created free and equal,
not some men, but all men, and they
draw the inference that Mr. Lincoln
would therefore most certainly hold that
the Filipinos should be free and inde
pendent, without waiting to learn the
rudiments of self-government.  Mr.
Lincoln himself did not carry the doc
trine so far. In his masterly discussion
with Stephen A. Douglas, Mr. Lincoln
defined the right to "life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness," as finding its
equivalent in the "right of the colored
man to eat the bread which his* own
hands earn," and asserting that in that
regard "he is our equal."I Mr. Lincoln
did not favor the immediate enfran
chisement of the negroes without prep
aration for citizenship.. In 1864 he
authorized the rehabilitation of the
government of Louisiana and favored
its recognition as a State in the Union
when it had adopted a constitution re
pudiating secession, avowing its adher
ence to the Union and recognizing the
emancipation of the negro, but without
having given him the right of suffrage,
but having guaranteed him equal school
privileges with the whites. President
Lincoln, like President McKinley, be
lieved that the American school house
must prepare the way for a self-govern
ing citizenship.
• "•.•
There are ' gentlemen, too, supporting
Mr.' Bryan who have the assurance to
Call themselqes "Lincoln Republicans,"
as contradistinguished from McKinley
Republicans, but if they were Republi
cans at all in Lincoln's day it was their
opposition to secession, or their faith in
the j element of | fiat, that was in the
greenback, that caught them aud not the
spirit of Lincoln's political apostleship.
There have. been Democrats of diverse
sorts, but there has not been, and is not,
more than one sort of Republican, and
that is just plain Republican. . Lincoln
was just a plain Republican and those
who are not just plain Republicans are
not Republicans at all and will vote for
Bryan or some other agitator of a pre
tended reform.
Abraham Lincoln was a protectionist.
These latter day alleged Lincoln Repub
licans are free traders.
. Abraham Lincoln sanctioned the
founding of the National banking sys
tem and commended it highly. These
new fangled pretenders to a Lincoln
Republicanism denounce the National
banking system as the embodiment of
financial imperialism and capitalistic
greed.
Abraham Lincoln was broad in his
construction of the constitution of this
republic. The so-called Lincoln Repub
licans are narrow and hair-splitting in
their construction of the constitution.
Abraham Lincoln was a man of action.
These pretended lovers of his quality of
Republicanism spend their time and
brain substance in unproductive dis
quisition over what Mr. Lincoln fitly
characterized as "pernicious abstrac
tions."
Abraham Lincoln believed in a stongly
centralized government, and not only
believed in it bnt made the government
mighty to save "government by, of and
for the people, that it might not perish
from the earth." Those who, with in
finite self-assurance, assume to call
themselves Lincoln Republicans and axe
going to vote for Bryan, to distinguish
themselves from true Republicans who,
every last one of them, will vote for
McKinley, prate of imperialism and
stand in fear of the destruction of
American liberties 'through the creation
of a power strong enough to defend
American liberties.
Bah! There is not in this country to
day a Lincoln Republican, who has not
lost his virility of manhood in the sen
ility of age, who is not a Republican
from center to circumference, from the
bosom which he bared to the shock of
battle to his heart's core. Men there
may be who voted for Lincoln who will
not vote for McKinley, but they were
Democrats then and Democrats now, or
they were fiatists then and fiatists now,
or they were men then and have now
succumbed in manliness to the ravages
of time, it being given to those who
wax old in the world to be once a man
and twice a child. For such as these, it
there be such, Republicans will utter
no word of reproach, for there is nothing
on earth more pitiful than a wreck that
was once a man.
* # •
The true Lincoln Republican is a true
McKinley Republican. There is much
in the career and character of William
jlc&uJu to wmlaa on« of.th* carm
and character of Xoraaani Lincoln, ana
we may be sure that the career and
character of Abraham Lincoln was not
lost on the young volunteer, from Ohio
who - now. bears a burden of care not
greatly less than that which Lincoln
bore, and bears it as bravely and as well.
Abraham Lincoln was Charged with
infidelity to the principles laid down in
the Declaration of Independence. So is
William McKinley.
Abraham Lincoln was charged with
imperialism,' with being a military auto
crat, with seeking to subvert the liber
ties of a fire* people. So is William
MoKinley. #
A war was . forced npon Abraham
Lincoln against his protests and in spite
of every concession which he could
honorably make. So was it upon Wil
liam McKinloy. - -
Abraham Lincoln was branded a
bloody butcher of his kind because ho
upheld the authority of the Constitution
and the law and with force of arms put
down an insurrection against the sover
eignty of the nation. William McKin
ley has suffered all this.
Abraham Lincoln never crossed a
bridge until ho got to it. In other
words he did not announce to the public
what he was going to do in any given
contingency until the contingency arose.
Neither does MoKinley.
Abraham Lincoln was far-seeing, dip
lomatic, a good judge of the character
of the men about him, deeply in earnest,
strong in his faith In the' American peo
ple and in AuJefi.cah destiny. So is
William McKinley.
Abraham Lincoln was unmoved by
hostile criticism, unworried by the peo
ple and papers who thinks little, but
dammor without ceasing, could abide
his time, waiting until he could catch
the current of events at its flood tide.
These things are pre-eminently true of
William McKinley.
' Abraham Lincoln was not a declaimer.
Neither is William McKinley. He
never sought to arouse the animosities'
of men, nor does McKinley. When the
time came so that it could be done with
out danger to diplomatic interests, or
the cause of tbe . Union, he \ took the
people into his confidence, and so does
McKinley. He never sought to bend
the popular will to his own, but sought
always and unceasingly to make that
will effective in the administration of
law. The same is true ' of McKinley.
William McKinley is accused of being
subservient, and so was Abraham Lin
coln, and the accusation is as false of
McKinley as it was of Abraham Lin
coln. 'As Mount Shasta looks lof tieet
when the observer is farthest away and
sees it towering over ranges and pin
nacles of intervening mountains, so the
character of Lincoln grows in grandeur
as the years intervene. It will be the
same with McKinley.
BRYAN'S PARAMOUNI'NESd.
In 1890 the paramount issue in the
eyes of Mr. Bryan was free trade. He
denounced the protection urea aud <K
clared that the country could not cou
tinue prosperous under a protective
tariff.
In 1892 he added free silver to his
paramount issues just as he couples
imperialism and militarism together
now.
In 1894 he dropped free trade and
made the free coinage ot silver para
mount of paramount issues.
This paramouutness lasted through
the campaign of 1890, but it did not pan
nut as he hoped and -bo he influenced
the United States senate to ratify the
treaty of Paris that liv might create an*
other paramount iss?e to do politics on.
What next?
There are indications that the para
mount issues or imperialism and mili
tarism have been badly puuctnred and
are' bobbing on flat tiers. The ancient
paramonutness of free silver would be
forgotten if Republicans wonld consent
to let it be forgotten aud from this time
mi the paramount howl of Bryanism
will be the trusts.
Mr. Bryan excells many men in many
p-irtictfiars, but he excells none of them
In nothing more than in the. readiness
with which he can be off with an old
political lov nod od with a new.
If every man who lws bettered his
condition since McKinley was inangu
tated, and because McKinlry was in
augurated, will Tote for McKiuley there
will not be enough rotes left for Bryau.
to keep him np even with the Prohibi
tion candidate. There is no form of
bateuwi more intolerable than iugrati
lode.

SOME SURE'THINGS.
Bets to Be Ainidrd by Tho»e> Who
Never Tried the Feats.
I Bets to be avoided by those who are
cocksure they can do all things are
those relating to athletic • feats. ;; It
would •soem that a good runner could
paslly give a start of 50 yards Id 100
to a man who was doing the 50 yards
by hopping on on*?, leg. But few run
ners. "If any. can afford to give that
amount of start' to any man | who Is
at allPtrong on his legs. For the first
five yards or bo they go at practically
tlw same pace, go that to run 95 yards
while j his opponent is hopping j45 he
has to Ko-morf than twice as fast, and
It is n weak man ' indeed who cannot
hop 50 yards In ten seconds. .
.An ordluary i wooden match Is easily
hrckon In the fingers, but," although
there are many who wllhbet they can
do Jt. none succeed In accomplishing
the task If the match is laid across the*
nnil of the middle, finger of either hand
and pressed upon by the first and third
fingers of that hand, despite its seem
ing so easy at first sight. !
. No - one can crush an egg placed
lengthwise between his clasped hands
—that is. if tho egg be sound and has
the ordinary shell of a hen's egg.
It Is safe to bet a man that he cannot
get. out , of a chair without bending
his body forward or putting his feet
under It. If be Is sitting on it, not at
the edge of It . .• 
'Another equally certain wager Is
that a man cannot stand at the side
of a room with both of his feet touch
ing the wainscoting lengthwise.
It is safe. to bet any niani save one
who is blind, that he ; cannot ' Stand
for five minutes without moving If
he is blindfolded.
Remember this, thoughtful voter. No
matter how adroitly Mr. Bryan may
strive to cut himself loose from the 16
to I' issue, and no matter how earnestl
~ms partisans may insist that that issc S
 >.b not an issue, that it is dead;,burie
find in an advanced state of decay— Mr.
•Bryan and all his political parlies 'are
pledged, solemnly and publicly pledg
3d to do all possible to bring about the im
mediate free coinage of silver at 1(J to 1.
If they are false to that in the hour of
their power, then their is no faith iv
them and they will prove false to aT
their other pledge*.
