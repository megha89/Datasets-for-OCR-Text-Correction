OLEST CLOCK IN ENGLN
Ejected In 1320 In One of the Towen
of Peterborough Cathedral
Peterborough cathedral has the old
est working clock in England It was
erected about 1320 and is probably the
work' of a monastic clockmaker It is
the only one now known that is wound
p oer an old wooden wheel This
wheel is about twele feet In circum
ference, and the galanized cable;
nbout 300 feet in length, supports" a
leaden weight of three hundredweight,
which has to be wound up daily
The clock is said to be of much more
primitie construction than that made
by Henry de Nick for Charles V of
France in 1370 The clock chamber
is in the northwest tower, some 120
feet high, where the sunlight has not
penetrated for hundreds of years, and
the winding is done by the light of a
caudle
The gong is the great tenor bell of
the cathedral, which weighs thirty
two hundredweight, and It is struck
hourly by an eighty pound hammer
The going and the striking parts of
the clock are some yards apart, com
munication being by a slender wire
The clock has no dial Tbe time is
shown on the main wheel of the es
capement, which goes round once in
two hours— London Chronicle
THE TOV»¥r OF HUNGER
 Famous TVison of Pisa Lone Stace
estroyed
"The Tower of Hunger" was a name
gien to the tower of Gualandi, in
Pisa, celebrated because of the refer
ence made to it In ante's "Inferno"
Ugojino count of Gherardesca (1220
89), was the head of a leading Ghi
belllne family in Pisa, eserting the
Ghibelllnes, he went oer to the
Guelphs fterward he returned to
his own side and Joined that uncom
promising faction which regarded
rchbishop Ruggieri as their head, un
til dissensions arose between him and
them after he had killed the archbish
op's nephew In a quarrel
In the; summer of 128S Ugollno was
seized by the Ghibelllnes and sent a
prisoner to fPersonalhe tower of Gualandi,
with his two sons, and two grandsons
Here they were kept till March, 1280,
when the door of the tower  was fas
tened, the keys thrown into the rno
and the prisoners left to die of stara
tion ; The tower, which was eer after
known as the "Tower of Hunger," was
in ruins at the end of the fifteenth cen
tury and was finally destroyed in 1655
FRIC
The Way That Name Was Bestowed
I'pon the Continent
The name frica was gien by the
Roman conquerors, after the third
Punic war, B O 16, to the proince
which they formed to coer the terri
tory of Carthage It was most prob
ably adopted from the word "fry
gah," the Carthagenian term for a col
ony
This original frica was limited in
extent Its borders reached, according
to Pliny, from tlie Rier Tusca on the
west, which diided it from Numidla,
to the bottom of the Syrtis Minor on
the southeast, though Ptolemy carries
It as far east as the bottom of the
Great Syrtis, making It Include Numl
dia and Tripolltana
In later days the whole frican con
tinent took Its name from this part,
which In Its narrower limits corre
sponded with the modern regency of
Tunis and was called by the Greeks
Lybia fricus, the stormy southwest
wind, was so called in Italy because it
blew from frica
Implements of Warfare
There is a story of a priateer's
crew of forty to fifty men capturing a
Turkish galley with 500 seamen and
soldiers on board by means of a swarm
of bees judiciously thrown among the
unspeakable ones Howeer this may
be, there are enough authentic In
stances of strange methods of attack
to proide amply sufficient material
for the casuist in deciding what is fair
and what unfair In war Burning
naphtha, boiling lead, birds, carcases
of men and horses, Chinese stinkpots,
besides the implements already men
tioned, hae all been used for offensie
or defensie purposes in actual war
fare
Prank ot the Lightning;
In 18 a fishing smack off one of the
Shetland Isles was struck by light
ning during a fierce storpi The bolt
first struck the mast, which It splin
tered completely It then passed to a
watch in the pocket of a man sitting
close to the mast and completely melt
ed it The man not only was unin
jured, but he did not know what had
taken place till he took his watch from
his pocket and found it fused into a
mass

The Way Be Silenced a Mlaaiouar?
In an rgument
"I used to know in ustralia aa in
telligent and interesting missionary,"
said an English nobleman "He and I
were talking one day about the na
ties of New Guinea, and he told me
bow one of these naties had stumped
him in a certain argument It seems
that he had accosted the natie and
urged him to let himself be ciilized
" 'But what good,' the natie asked,
'will this ciilization of yours do me?
" 'Well,' said the missionary, 'yon
will cease, for one thing, to [ Idle  all
your time away You will learn the
delights of honest labor'
" 'What good will the labor do ine7
" 'Through It yon will gradually ac
cumulate money, and in time, with
frugality, you will possess much stow
of honestly acquired riches'
"The natie was still unconinced
'What good will the riches do me?' wai
his next question
"'They,' said the missionary, wiH
enable you to cease from work at last
and to spend the rest of your days in
well earned rest'
"The natie laughed
" 'It seems to me,' he said, 'that if I
did as you say I would be taking a
mighty roundabout course to get to the
place I started from,' "
INI RUBBER
Its Form of Structure Which Permits
It te Be Elastic
Modern physics teach us that the
molecules of all bodies are in a state of
incessant motion; that the Intimate
structure of matter Is, in fact, a repro
duction on an infinitely minute scale of
the reoling suns and planets,
 In gases and liquids this motion Is
most extensie In range, but in solids
the moements of the molecules are
more restrained, and they merely os
cillate or rotate about a certain mean
position, the range of motion being
strictly goerned by the attractions
producing it
If by the pull of an outside force the
molecules are drawn out beyond the
limit of their mutual attractions the
body is broken, b'g't within this limit It
will recoer Itself when the pull ceases
We may regard the particles of rubr
ber as reoling in circles When it Is
stretched these orbits become elliptic,
returning to the circular form when
released s then this substance pos
sesses a ery wide range of ariation
of molecular distance without rupture
it is eminently elastic
OCTOR OF NCING
This Title Was Gien f o Peanchntnni
by Louis XW
In France during the reign of Louis
XIV dancing took a ery prominent
position among court festiities, and
 many members of the royal family
took part In the complex ballets of tba
time Louis himself, no mean perform
er, took lessons for twenty years from
Beauchamps, who was called the far
tber of nil dancing masters and upon
whom the king conferred the title doc
tor as a special mark of faor
Beauchamps had the honor of ap
pearing ns partner with the king in the
minuet, a dance which was introduced
in 1050 in France, and no court ball
was opened in Europe for a century
and a half without It
bout the ygar |661 a royal aead
ejny of dancing was formed under the
auspices of Beauchamps, Lull!, Mollere
and others, the object of which was to
eleate the art and check all abuses
Of this academy Beauchamps was

 Story of a Scholar
Theodor Mommsen, the famous his
torian, had not only the appearaqct
t>ut the manner of a scholar Once
during the half hour's drie from Ber
lin to Charlottenburg the car In which
the professor rode went badly off the
track The rest of the passengers
alighted, the horses were remoed and
the stranded car was left until help
could be found Mommsen remained,
reading his book n hour passed, and
the sound of leers and Jacks and the
plunging of horses' hoofs aroused h!n>
from his reerie With no sign of dis
composure he arose from his seat and
went to the door "h," said he, "we
seem to hae come to a standstill"
Maine Counties,
The three original counties of Maine
had good old English county names,
York, Cumberland and Lincoln Onty
two, Oxford and Somerset, hae been
similarly named since, all the rest ha
ing good merican appellations For
the names of ndroscoggln, roostook,
Kennebec, Penobscot, Plscataquls and
Sagadahoc find their origin among the
aborigines, while franklin, Hancock,
Knox and Washington bear the names
of distinguished mericans of the

Salt pork is a famous old
fashioned remedy for con
sumption "Eat plenty of
pork," was the adice to the
consumptie 50 and 100
years ago
Salt pork is good if a man
can stomach it The idea
behind it is that fat is the
food the consumptie needs
Scott's Emulsion is the mod
ern method of feeding fat to
the consumptie Pork is too
rough for sensitie stomachs
Scott's Emulsion is the most
refined of fats, especially
prepared for easy digestion
Feeding him fat in this
way, which is often the only
way, is half the battle, but
Scott's Emulsion does more
than that There is some
thing about the combination
of cod lier oil and hypophos
phites in Scott's Emulsion
that puts new life into the
weak parts and has a special
action on the diseased lungs

Jokal's Joke
t a banquet held In his honor In the
town of Torda, Maurus Jokai, the Hun
garian writer, was called upon to pro
pose the toast of "The Ladles" He
made an excellent speech, during which
he continually toyed with the brown
curls upon his forehead • Finally he
saidPersonal "I raise my glass in honor of the
gracious ladles of Torda May they all
lie until my hair grows gray" • His
audience drank to the toast, but it was
easy to see by the faces of the ladles
present that they did not think much
of the compliment Jokal rose again
from his seat and took from his head
a magnificent brown wig, showing an
entirely bald head beneath it  "My
hair," he added, "will neer grow
gray" nd the ladles, who had not
known of his baldness, were more than
pacified
Two Headed Symbols
Both Russia and Germany display
two headed eagles on their standards
Yet this symbol is considered by some
heralds to be 'merely the result of the
heraldic practice of "dlmidiation" Thla
was simply a child's way of impaling
two coats of arms on the same shield
by the primitie method of cutting
each in half and taking the dexter bait
of one and the sinister half of the other
and placing them back to back, as it
were Strange two headed beasts nat
urally resulted, as, for instance, when
a lion and an eagle were haled and
Joined together The griffin is sup
posed to hae been eoled from two
lions rampant by dlmidiation It robs
the two headed eagle of half its ter
rors to know that It owes its origin
to this sort of child's play

THE ELECTION
The result of the national election
' is so oerwhelmingly in faor of the
Personal republicans that it presages the dis
' integration of the democratic party
Neer in the political history of the
country has such a crushing defeat
oertaken a great national party
It was a foregone conclusion that
Rooseelt would be elected, but few
belieed the ictory would be of
such a sweeping character Eery
northern and western state has been
swept by the republican tidal wae
There is nothing left for the demo
crats but the south, and the solidity
of that section has been broken
Parker has made  a much poorer
showing than Bryan did four years
ago No doubt the tact that the
democratic standbearer in the iast
days of the campaign, in the bitter
ness of impending defeat, lost his
temper, and made public charges of
a slanderous nature against the
president, lost him the support of
many selfrespecting democrats, f It
was a thing unheard of before in a
presidential campaign, for one nomi
nee to stoop to making serious
charges against his opponent, and
especially when there was nothing
brought forward to substantiate
them It will take the democrats
four years to gather the broken
fragments of their party together
for the next campaign They are so
utterly routed that they will prob
ably seek some more alliances before
challenging the erdict of the ballot
box again The merican people
cannot be flimflammed by demo
cratic sophistries They know when
 they are doing tolerably well, and
• hae resoled, in the most emphatic
manner, to "let well enough alone"
California has contributed its
quota to the republican tidal wae
She has gien the largest majority
 for Rooseelt eer gien for a presi
 deritial candidate It looks like a
" congressional delegation has
been elected • V;
 mador county has scored heaily
on the republican side The Roose
elt electors hae a plurality of
; 370 Only four precincts in the
county were carried by the demo
cratsand these by ery slim margins
Of the local candidates, Caminetti,
for congress, made a gallant fight,
and won his home county by a hand
some majority of oer 500 He was
expected to do this The other
heay republican counties, howeer,
Personal swept him to defeat with the rest of
his party aspirants for congressional
honors '''
t  C H McKenney, republican for
assemblyman, ran behind his ticket
in nearly eery precinct in the
I county Of course he is carried to
ictory by the sheer popularity of
the party ticket Howeer, the
Jpeople hae not failed to register
  their protest at the course pursued
"by him in the last legislature, in at
tempting to oerride the constitu
tion which he was sworn to respect
and obey " The rebuke is all the
more striking when it is remembered
that his opponent neer entered the
• limits of mador county during the
canass He was in the east from
the time he was nominated until a
few days before the election  Con
Isequently he was not able to do any
electioneering whateer What
would hae occurred if an actie
campaign had been made in his be
half can only be surmised , ,'V
The superisor contests hae
brought about a peculiar situation
Wesley M mick has been reelected
by a decisie majority M Brinn,
I the republican candidate in town
ship , has been defeated by Fraser,
democrat In township 1 John
Strohm has won a ictory as an in
dependent candidate This makes
the board stand two democrats and
two republicans, with John Strohm,
the independent member, holding
the balance of power Personal^'^
THE RIGHT SPIRIT OF WORK
Some people work to lie, and
being in consequence indifferent to
success, do not win it Many lie
to work, and desiring success, secure
it No one can succeed who does
not loe the work in which he is en
gaged Those who regard work as
irksome, to be done as a necessity,
who work only in order that they
may lie, neer adance, and cannot
appreciate and understand the suc
cess of the man who engages in work
for the pleasure and satisfaction it
gies, as well as the liing it affords

RIGHT TO VOTE
Some discussion has been indulged
in of late on account of'the fact that
some, persons, not now actually re
siding in mador county, continue
to claim a residence here]! and come
here to ote at each election In
some cases they hae no interests
whateer here, and they eidently
desire to retain their oting place
here for the purpose of miugling in
the local affairs of the  county We
do not pretend to discuss the ex
pediency ,f this course Whether it
tends to help or injure the cause or
the candidates of their choice is not
for us to say There seems to be an
erroneous impression abroad that
some who ote here are not en
titled to  this ritfht on account
of their former identity with ma
dor; that the proision that a per
son does not lose his residence by
irtue of being employed in the pub
lic serice, applies only to the fed
eral serice The proision of the
codes on this poiut reads as followsPersonal
Section 1239 subdiision 2 of the
political codes readsPersonal
2—  person must not be held to
hae gained or lost residence by reason
of his presence or absence from a place
while employed in the serice of the
United States, or of this state, nor
while engaged in naigation, nor while
a student at any institution of learning,
nor while kept in an almshouse, asylum
or prison < ;Personal£
This clearly shows ' that a person
holding either a federal or state
office, the duties of which demand
his residence elsewhere,, may retain
his residence in the county and pre
cinct in which he formerly lied
The policy, howeer, of officious in
terference in behalf of any local
candidate by the officeholding class
who hae no material interest in the
county may well be questioned
It is more apt to injure than help
the cause espoused

C W Randall s James and Eliza
beth Toman— Suit for the specific per
formance of contract The complaint
sets forth that about October 12, 1901,
plaintiff and defendants entered into a
certain agreement in writing,' whereby
the defendants agreed to sell to plaintiff
50 per cent of all mineral beneath the
surface of certain lands situated east of
the Summit mine,' near Sutter Creek
Two certain actions, were pending in
the superior court at that time, affect
ing, the title to said property, therefore
it was agreed to ' employ "C has W
Slack and Van" R Paterson as at
torneys to represent the parties to the
agreement referred to irrsaid actions
without cost to the Tomans C W
Randall agreed to repay to the Tomans
on or before No 10, 1901, all expenses
incurred or paid out by them in the
trial of said " actions, not exceeding
$1000  It was further agreed that the
party of second part ( Randall ) should
hae 50 per cent of all mining proper
ties embraced in agreement, including
the ore taken, therefrom by any person
or corporation The party of the
second part was to pay to the first part
on or before No 1, 1902, $2000 of the
$70,000 purchase price, and upon failure
to' do so his right to "purchase a one
half interest therein should be forfeited
Plaintiff claims that he has duly per
formed all conditions of said agreement
on his part, except that he has not
exercised his option to purchase the 50
per cent interest on said property, and
is able and willing to perform all other
conditions when the time for the per
formance thereof arries, but that de
fendants hae repudiated the agree
ment, and unless restrained by tho
court will dispose of said property
Wherefore  plaintiff prays that the
agreement referred to which is not of
record, be adjudged in full force; that
defendants be required to execute a
deed to plaintiff for interest in said
property in accordance with said agree
ment, and that they be enjoined from
selling said property, and for costs

Catting Scrape
 cutting affray occurred near the
Piccardo saloon, on the Jackson Gate
road, on Monday afternoon The
parties were H Bradley, who is en
gaged in the lumber business in the
mountains, and W Gardiner It seems
that Gardiner had been working for
Bradley in getting out logs and lagging
during the summer When they met
Gardiner wanted a settlement for the
balance due him, amounting it is said
to something like $90 It does not ap
pear that there was any dispute about
the amount due, but Bradley wished
to defer tbe matter Thereupon
Gardiner became belligerent, and the
pair came to blows Bradley had his
pocket knife in bis hand at the time,
and used it, cutting Gardiner across
tbe abdomen, inflicting a gash that
would hae penetrated tbe caity had
it, not been for striking a rib He also
slashed him on the right side of the
face Bradley Yeceied a bruise in the
hand and also about the breast,
thought to hae been caused by a rock
Bradley gae himself up and was placed
in jail It is not thought, howeer, that
the case will be prosecuted Bradley,
who is a man well along in years,
claims to hae acted in selfdefense
Bystanders interfered and preented
the encounter being fought to a more
serious conclusion
Bradloy was released yesterday, no
charge being made against him

THE STPLES' CSE
Coroner's Jury ' inds that Mrs Staples'
eath was laused by rsenic Poisoning
The coroner's jury impanelled to in
estigate the circumstances of the
death of Mrs Edna May Staples, as
sembled in Sutter Creek on Wednes
day last Mrs Staples, as has already
been stated in these columns, died in
mador City on ugust 31, and was
buried two days thereafter, uo sus
picion at the time being aroused that
death was due to other than natural
causes Tbe doctor's certificate gae
internal hemorrhage as the cause of
death When the husband, r F N
Staples, left mador, after hurriedly
closing his business affairs, and also
Mrs Hoxie, the following week, ugly
rumors became rife that thn death was
perhaps caused by criminal means
The body was exhumed, and the
stomach sent to Thomas Price, the
well known analytical chemist, for
analysis The jury consisting of the
following persons Jack Simons C E
Richards, W H Hancock, E E Riehl,
W S Smith, H R Higgins, V Brig
noli, L Nixon and L Katz, was sworn
and iewed tbe body, but tbe inquest
was adjourned to enable the chemist to
make a report of his analysis This
report was receied from San Francisco
early this week, so the inquest was
held Wednesday, district attorney
Vicini being present in behalf of the
people
The report of the result of the chem
ical analysis was not submitted tp the
jury, but the district attorney stated
that it was to the effect that arsenic
had been found in the stomach In
what quantity was not stated, nor
whether the amount reealed by the
analysis was sufficient to cause death;
the simple fact that arsenic was present,
and that the drug eratrum iride was
not detected The report was deemed
incomplete, and hence the district at
torney before taking further action
awaits more light on important points
from tbe chemist
Four witnesses were examined Mies
Minnie Hinkson, who waited on the
sick woman at the time of dissolution,
stated tbe circumstances of the death
She was not present at the moment of
death She was sent almost as soon as
the breath left the body to notify the
undertaker to come oer from Sutter
Creek and embalm the body"
J anerl, the undertaker, testified
that he injected the embalming fluid
into the femoral artery as soon as he
arried, which was not more than an
hour or so after death r Staples
told him that he had gien the corpse
a good cleaning out befpre his arrial
r  M Gall testified that the em
balming process would not account fpr
the presence of arsenic in tbe stomach,
unless a bloodessel had been ruptured
by the injection of the fluid There
was no indications of this reealed by
the autopsy; no signs of internal hem
orrhage The ital organs were
healthy
L B Hoxie, the husband of the
woman with whom r Staples is
thought to hae eloped, testified to
certain circumstances bearing on the
case
Tbe jury brpught in a erdict that
Mrs Edna May Staples died from the
effects of arsenic administered by some
unknown person
It has been ascertained that r
Staples did not gq tp New yprk as 'he
announced his intentipn pf doing  He
and Mrs Hoxie went to San Francisco,
and were passing there as man
and wife He started to practice medi
cine in the city The pair appear to
hae been wholly ignorant that sus
picions were entertained as to the cause
of Mrs Staples' death, and the action
of the authorities here tp'prqye fir dis
proe these si|B[)iciqns ' 'J\U<i\ an item
appeared in the San Chroni
cle, stating that tbe body of Mrs
Staples had been exhumed, and the
stomach forwarded to a chemist for
analysis r Staples and his companion
fled from tbe city They left in an un
cermonlous manner The doctor's
sign was not taken down, and one
trunk was left in the apartments oc
cupied by the pair Efforts hae been

nother Catting Scrape
Tho only disturbance desering of
mention on election day in Jackson,
occurred on Broadway street on Tues
day eening It was not the outcome
of any discussion or dispute oer elec
tion matters either, but was caused by
imbibing too freely of liquor  wagon
load of oters from the electric plant
had been to Clinton to ote It is one
of the absurdities— and certainly not
the least — of our local arrangements
for conducting an election, that oters
liing at Electra, although within three
miles of a polling place, hae to trael
from 12 to 15 miles to ote In trael
Ing half this distance they hae to pass
within a quarter of  mile of two other
oting places But this is digressing
from  our  subject The returning
oters passed through Jackson jon
their way home, aod stopped in front
of the Chicago hotel a few moments
Some of them went inside On re
appearing they found seeral others,
bound also for Electra, had taken pos
session of the wagon There was not
room for the new arrials They were
ordered out, and forced out  fight
ensued, and in the scrimmage a man
named Sidney Carter, an engineer at
the plant, was stabbed in the hip with
a pocket knife in the hands of Carlo
Luperani Carter was also cut in the
back,, and a piece bitten out of one of
his fingers The knife thrust it} the
hip cut a bloodessel, and the blood
spurted out in a stream He would
hae speedily bled to death but for the
timely, arrial of r Gall on the scene,
who secured the ruptured ein and
stopped the outflow pf blood The
wounded niqn was taken tp the Globe
hotel H e U getting along nicely,  and
no serious consequences are anticipated
The assailant, Luperani,' was arrested,
and is now in jail awaUipg examination
Sheriff wept tp Electra yester
day and brought another man to jail,
charged with taking part In the affair
Final Republican Bally
The final meeting on the republican
side was held in Loe's hall on Monday
eening  fair sized audience greeted
the occasion, the seats being occupied
principally by the ladies The Jackson
band was out to awaken enthusiasm
apd som,e giant pqwder wa_s exploded
pn th,o hill to create a furore and draw
the crowd I, t hfts been pretty much
of an uphill work to get up any interest
in a political gathering this year, and
the final whoopup was no exception to
the rule The meeting was presided
oer by E C Voorheis as chairman,
who was introduced by C  Herripk,
the chairman of the cqunty cQtflmiitee
One noticeable departy're fronj recent
pustom was" the absence' of the usual
array of icepresidents pq the platform
in the rear of the speaker Phis was a
step'inthe right direction The idea
of naming 15 or 20 persons to take seats
behind a speaker is one that might be
surrendered with grace
fter a few remarks by the chair
man, C H McKenney, present as
semblyman from thjg diatrlct, and
candidate for ' reefectiori| was intro
duced ' His speech was ery brief He
seemed much embarrassed, and came
to a standstill once or twice, and frank
ly stated tb,at he did qqt beliee he was
makingPersonal much Qf an impression^ la
conclusion he said he stood squarely on
the record he had made He did not
mention the tnuchtalkedof justice and
constables' salary bill, but promised to
work faithfully for the district if elected 
J F ais was next introduced as
the attraction of the eening He
started in on the pp J qs,tl,tu,tiqnal amend
ments, andlgaYe his iews as to which
sftoujd be oted up and which oted
down He said a local paper had dis
cussed the matter in a wlshy washy
way, and his speech on the whole sub
ject matter was oted by a big majority
of his audience of a like slipshod
superficial character He, urged, them,
especially to ™\e for the courts
of i^ppetjl, and against the extension of
the legislatie session and limitation of
attaches' His argument for tha Jatter
was that It was unwise t£ take the ap
pointment of attaches from' the caucus
pf the'party in the majority, which se
cured absolute exclusion o;f unworthy
men, und confer the appointie power
on the Indiidual member It was
nothing more than the argument of
the politician to be left alone In doling
out the patronage The congressional
election was slightly touched u,pqn, and
the assembly con^t defended
McKenßay in passing" the salary grab
bill, by saying that the board of super
isors and prominent taxpayers peti
tioned for the measure ( The same

Qnnrlc Mnslc Teachers and the Hun
They o Pnplls
"Ninetyfie per cent of all ocal
teachers are quacks," said an old mu
sician Few singers would doubt the
assertion Probably in no other kind
of work can a man who knows practi
cally nothing about a subject do so
quickly a lucratie amount of teach
ing There are many common types —
the piano teacher who cannot get
enough pupils to make a liing, the
broken down old time singer, the dere
lict of the concert halls, who neer
could sing himself, and many more
Their half hour lessons may be said to
consist onethird of chat and gossip,
onethird of scales and exercises and
onethird of the singing of the pupil
faorite songs, all interspersed with
just enough commendation and criti
cism to keep the pupil's good opinion
of both himself and of her teacher
There are teachers whose training haa
not only ruined oices, but temporarily
harmed general health as well Oer
against these charlatans of the profes
sion there are conscientious men and
women who can detect faults in a
oice and knpw how to correct them
and who work carefully and enthusi
astically for each indiidual pupil
It is not easy to tell the good teacher
from the quack, and you will find bit
ter early experiences in many a suc
cessful singer's career — Leslie's Month

N RBITRRY TYRNT
This utocrat Exists Solely by th
Will of the People
nd it came to pass that in the ery
height of modern times an arbitrary
tyrant ruled oer a great country call
ed merica The name of this tyrant
was Eerybodydoesit, and all the in
habitants of the land bowed themseles
to his will  •  ";f;rPersonal
Terror of the autocrat caused grown
men and women to cast aside eery
dictate of common sense — sometimes
of honesty as well Children oer
studied, wearing out precious eyesight,
cramping growing organs, yet mothers
whispered under their breath the name
of Eerybodydoesit and the eil went
ou Men bought houses and European
passages, automobiles and other ex
pensie luxuries, the cost of which was
out "of all proportion to their income
"Eorybodydoesit" was the explana
tion they gae _
Sorriest of all was the case of the
young girls They patronized un
wholesome plays, read books produced
by diseased minds, they oerdressed,
abandoned the gentle ideals of their
mothers' day and grew old before their
time "Eerybodydoesit," they said
nd thus it was in all classes of soci
ety throughout the broad land ll
men and women, young and old, recog
nized the sway of Eerybodydoesit and
bowed their necks to his yoke—Phila

n ccommodation Train
In the lake district of England there
Is a tiny railway which has only one
train run by two officials, one of whom
is managing director, ticket collector,
guard and porter and the other chief
engineer, engine drier and stoker The
train stops anywhere It frequently
goes off the line, but crowbars are car
ried, with which the train is persuaded
to return to its proper position When
a friend of either ofllclal is obsered
the train Is brought to a standstill t
one time, when the managing director
was courting the daughter of a farmer
through whose lands the line ran, the
young lady would take her stand at a
certain gate eery eening, the train
would be stopped, •and the young man
would kiss her good night
Idiik Widowhood,
In 1753, in the ninetysixth year of
her age, died Jean Countess of ltox
burghe She was not a ery remarka
ble woman, but her memory is pre
sered on account of her long widow
hood, which lasted seentyone years
Her father, the first Lord Tweeddale,
fought at Marston Moor in 1C
This Countess of Roxburghe's long
widowhood is insignificant compared
with that of a certain gnes Skinner
ccording to an inscription in Camber
well church, this worthy woman died
in 100 at the age of 110 years, Tiaing
suried her husband only eight years
less than a century

INVESTING MONEY
Be Sure or Tour Scheme Before Yos
Risk Your Saing
on't tie yourself or your money up
on't risk all your saings in any
scheme, no matter, how much it may
promise on't inest your hard earn
ed money in anything  without first
making a thorough and searching in
estigation o not be misled by those
who tell you that it is "now or neer"
and that if you wait you are liable to
lose the best thing, that eer came to
you Make up your mind that if you
lose your money you will not lose your
head and that you will riot inest in
anything until you thoroughly under
stand all about It There are plenty
of good things waiting If you miss
one there are hundreds of others Peo
ple will tell you that the opportunity
will go by and you will lose a great
chance to make money if you do not
act promptly But take your time and
inestigate Make it a cast iron rule
neer to inest In any enterprise until
you hae gone to the ery bottom of it,
and if it Is not so sound that leel
headed men will put money In it do not
touch It The habit of Inestigating
before you embark in any business will
be a happiness protector and an ambi
tion protector as well — Orison Swett

BITING THE THUMB
It Used to Be Considered a Pledge of
Mortal Reenge
In "Romeo and Juliet" the serants
of Capulet and Montague begin a quar
rel by one biting his thumb at the oth
ers Commentators hae regarded this
act as an Insult, quoting the following
passage from ecker's "ead TermPersonal"
"What swearing Is there, what shoul
dering, what Jostling, what Jeering,
what biting of thumbs to beget quar
rels!"
Sir Walter Scott, howeer, In a note
to the "Lay of the Last Minstrel," says,
"To bite the thumb or the gloe seems
not to hae been considered upon the
border as a gesture of contempt,
though so used by Shakespeare, but as
a pledge of mortal reenge" >It 'was
thus accounted to be a solemn assur
ance that at the proper time tbesword
should settle the dispute or purge the
offense
Something of the sort may hae pre
ailed among the Romans, for it is
thought that the Latin pollieeri, to
promise, is deried from pollex, the
thumb
PRISONS OF SILENCE
Where Conicts Eer Wear Shronda
and Sleep Beside Coffins
Entombed in a grim castle on the
outskirts of Lisbon are some of the
most miserable men on earth These
are the inmates of Portugal's deadly
prisons of silence In this building e
erything that human ingenuity can
suggest to render the lies of its pris
oners a horrible, maddening torture ie
done The corridors, piled tier on tier
fie stories high, extend from a com
mon center like the spokes of a huge
wheel The cells are narrow, tomb
like, and within each stands a coffin
The prison garb is a shroud The at
tendants creep about in felt slippers
No one is allowed to utter a word
The doors are unlocked, and the half
a thousand wretches march out, cloth
ed in shrouds and with faces coered
by masks, for it is a part of this
hideous punishment that none may
look upon the countenances of his fel
low prisoners Few of them endure
this torture for more than ten years
 Fie ays' Loe Story
t the present time we are always
talking about the rush and hurry of
the twentieth century re we really
so rapid as we think we are? Cer
tainly few girls of fourteen hae any
thing  like the amount of experience
and emotion in many weeks of life that
Juliet, Shakespeare's heroine, had
crammed into fie days and a half
The time is thus apportionedPersonal ' On
Sunday the ball took place, and on
Monday Romeo and Juliet were mar
ried On Tuesday Juliet took the
draft, and on Wednesday she was
placed in the tomb On Thursday Ro
meo returned, and on Friday the hap
less pair committed suicide
The Japanese Bnby
The Japanese baby's head is shaed
in a curious fashion, and neer, under
any circumstances, does the mother or
baby wear a hat or bonnet Nor "does
he wear shoes, een in the coldest

pink toes peep out from the mother's
garments, and he rides pickapack,
strapped on tightly, happy, chubby,
smiling always and dressed, when he
ia allowed to get out of the binding
garments, in the most dainty of kimo

FTE [OF  BIG OHIO TREE
Slme of This Great Sycamore Was tha
Cause of Its estruction
The greatest tree eer seen by white
men in Ohio is belieed to hae been
the enormous sycamore, or, more prop
erly, buttonwood, which stood In what
Is now Valley township, Scioto county,
In the rich bottom lands of the Scioto
rier
tt was so prodigious in bulk that as
Jrly as 1810 It was described In th
Cincinnati lmanac as one of the natu
ral wonders of Ohio In June, 1808, at
cording to what seems reliable test"
mony, a party of thirteen persons, all
on horseback, rode into the hollow
trunk of this sycamore and found thai
room enough remained for two mow
horses and their riders The tret
forked about eight feet from the
'ground, and It was hollow when flrsi
Been by the white settlers The circum
ference of the trunk was about sixty
three feet at the base, and fie fed
from the earth It was fortytwo feet In
girth These figures remind the reader
of the famous big trees of California
The opening into the caity within the
trunk was ten feet wide at the bottom,
nine and a half feet high, and the hol
low was about fourteen feet In diame
ter
The account which has been pre
sered of the fate of this enormous tree
Is ery odd It Is claimed that the gi
ant buttonwood was kept uninjured at
a great curiosity until the farm on
which it stood was used as a stock
farm by one Thomas ngan This
stock breeder turned seeral aluable
bulls into the fields where the huge
tree stood, and two of them fought in
Bide its trunk In that small space foi
a bull ring the ictor was able to pre
ent the escape of his rial, and th
weaker was killed This affair con
inced ugan that the largest tree in
Ohio was a menace to his stock, and
he cut It down Later hogs kept In the
same field were attacked by cholera,
and the owner reasoned that their hab
it of lying Inside the hollow stump was
bad for their health, and so he had the
stump remoed It may well be doubt
ed whether any other Immense tree
was eer destroyed because of a fight
between two bulls— Cleeland Leader

Respectability is no substitute for

How He Protected the Seals
Some years ago a Russian warship
was on special duty in Bering sea
guarding the seal fisheries, preenting
the slaughter of the seals during the
closed season The admiral of the sta
tion in the course of an inspection of
the essel inited any of the sailors
who had any complaint to make to
step forward One of the men, as
spokesman for the whole crew, com
plained that the "seal money" prom
ised them had not been paid On the
astonished admiral Inquiring what he
meant it came out that the ship's com
mander had been doing a lucratie
trade by killing the seals placed under
bis protection and sending the ikina to
London and had taken the crew into
partnership He was duly transferred
to Siberia
 Hearty Farewell
The old friends bad enjoyed their
three days together In spite of the fact
that tact was not a conspicuous qual
ity of either of them
'Tft>u hae quite a pretty place here,
John," said the guest as he took a
final look about him on the morning of
his departure— "quite a pretty place,
though it looks a bit bare as yet"
, "Oh, that's because the trees are so
young," said the host comfortably "I
hope they'll hae grown to a good size
before you come again Then you'll
see how much Improed the place will
be" nd they shook hands with mu
tual affection and good will
He Knew the Naties
 tourist, after isiting the Bine
grotto at Capri, was approached by a
fisherman who demanded 15 cents ad
mission The tourist, • haing no
change, gae him a fie franc note
and got back a handful of coins Look
ing them oer, he said, "Padrone, why
haen't you gien me at least one good
coin?" The fisherman laughed, took
back his Greek, Roumanian, rgentine
and other outlandish coins and gao
the tourist Italian money

before I can make enough to support
you She It is so hard to wait He
(braely) — I knew it But of course
you know the world doesn't know any
thing about me yet — Brooklyn Life

"Why, Willie, I hae nothing to do
