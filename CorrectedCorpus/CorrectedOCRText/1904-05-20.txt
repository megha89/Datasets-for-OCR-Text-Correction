 PRINCE OF PROIGLS
FORMER HOSTLER BECOMES 
CLIFORNI MILLIONIRE
nd Spends Vast Sums in Openhearted
Manner — Loyal to Old Friends and;
Generous to nyone Who
 Struck His Fancy
[ Saturday Globe, Utlco, N V, Feb 13, 1901 ]
One of the most prodigal of million
aires who eer surprised a section of
the country by the liberality of his
spending* was James M unn, who
recently died in Paris unn was the
sod of a laborer and was born at James
town, NY s a boy ha worked as
a hostler and then drifted westward,
workingPersonal in arious menial capacities
in Cleeland, St Louis and Kansas
City Twenty years ago he reached 1
the tolil mining camps of Calaeras
anfl Neada  counties, Cal For 12
years he lied the life of a desert pros
pector— a$ hard a life as any merican
citizen knows nowadays uringPersonal a few
months in each year be would work in
the bowels of a Calaeras county mine,
while he saed eery dime possible
toward another season of prospecting
among the Cocopah mountains, or the
desolate couutry in the region of eath
Valley, or across the Mojae esert
t length he located the golden ledge
of the Big Jennie mine in  mad or
county and soon became a millionaire
seeral times oer He had an income
at times as high as $13,000 a month
from the property With the beginning
of the deelopment of' his gold disco
eries at what is now known as the min
ing camp of unnille, unn announced
that his work was oer /' Henceforth"
he said "I'll hae a gay time and when
I'm dead I'll be tenderly remembered
by some people, anyhow"
SPENS MONEY LIKE WTE^R
He held to thisfpolicy When he had
bought a house for his aged mother
near Golden Gate Park, in San Fran
cisco, and had settled a certain share
of the Big Jennie diidends upon her,
he went abroad seeking pleasure He
gae $2000 to a sickly old printer who
had been friendly to him in his days of
poerty He sent $1,500 at Christmas,
1897, to the widow of a printer in New
York who had gien him a home for a
few weeks years before, and he sent
$500 to pay a $75 bill contracted in
Brooklyn years preiously
Two years ago he took a fancy to a
mixed drink that a Los ngoles bar
tender concocted He was going to
isit the City of Mexico, and he asked
the bartender to mix seeral quart bot
tles of the drink for him to take along
on his trip When the bartender re
plied that tho stuff wouldn't stand bot
tlinir longer than a few hours, unn in
aisled thaj, the bartender and his wife
should go along pn the tqur at his ex
pense Tho trio wore gone two months,
and all the bartender had to do was to
mix drinks for unn
t another timo when unn was get
ting shaed in Los ngeles he remark
ed that bo was about  to go to New
York on a pleasure trip
"What wouldn't I gie to go like
that, with neer a care on my mind!"
said the barber
"Eer been to New York?" asked
unn
"No, and I probably neer shall go"
"Well, now, I'm looking around' for
another fel'ow to fill out our party, "
said unn, "and you corao right along
this afternoon I'e got three other
men who hae neer boon east, and
we'll all haye a big time together
What's more, it won't cost you a cent
all the time you're gone from tho shop ','
That pleasure trip cost unn $6,000,
and be always said that it was the best
time of his life He had a tender spot
in his heart for streot urchins, because
he had been one himself He neer
went to San Francisco or to any other
eastprn city without attracting atten
tion by the showers o f money be scat
tered among the street children about
the hotels whore he stopped Once he
tossed $500 in siler coin out of a sec
ond story window of the Palace Hotel
in San Francisco He used to leae $20
gold pieces among the rumpled clothes
on his bed, and when the coin was ro
turned to him by an hqnest chamber
maid he would gie it back with one or
two tnoro of the same alue
LOYL TO HIS OL FRIENS
He was isiting the jail in Portland
Ore, a year ago when he saw confined
there a mq,n whqin he once knew as a
brother prospector in rizona The
man was awaiting trial for forgery
unn hired a lawyer to defend the
prisoner and at an expense of hundreds
of dollars got the man acquitted 
Last suQituei', while at Santa
Cataliua lsland, he conceied a fancy
for a Mexican boatman who took him
out fishing, and one day he surprised
the poor fellow by the gift of a $2,300
houso
 class of girls in a priate gptpinary
at San Francisco permitted him to so?
loct tho class motto for them, and when
the graduating exercises were oer he
hired a Pullman car and sent the whole
class with two teachers'* as chaperons
on a 30day tour of the Pacific coast
and to tl}o Ye!?o w §tpne Park
He once heard a young woman sing
in an opera i Chicago, and when he
learned that she was supporting herin

alid mother and sister he paid the op
eratic manager to release her from her
contract and sent all three to California
for six months at his expense For a
eteran prospector, who broke down
from hardship and exposure, he bought
a home, and then fitted out the old fel
low's two sons for a prospecting trip to
the Klondike
uring the summer of 1898 he wont
abroad with fie men from rizona and
California who had been his friends in
the days of want, and he let none of
the party take a cnl along  mother
in unnille who named tier baby for
him found a sack of 100 $20 gold pieces
on the door step one day He once
gae eery woman in a dance hall at
BakersQeld $300 to go home and lead a
better life, but the local preacher who
spoke of tho act in church on tho follow
ing Sunday he neer forgae Two
Christmases ago he sent anonymously
$50 in money to a'dozen or two eter
ans of tho Soldiers' Home at Santa
Monica
When the smallpox broke out in the
gold camps in madur county two win
ters ago and two men finally olun
teered to nurse the sick in the pest
bouse, he bought each of them a cot
tage home, and he had the houses fur
nished completely, iady for the men
and their families to moe into when
the epidemic was oer Last Noem
ber he secretly sent 10 lons of haras and
many bushels of corn to a friendly and
noglectod tribe of Indians, the Pimas,
whom he heard were staring because
of drought on their reseration in
southern rizona
It now turns out that the manager
of the consumpties' hospital at Phoe
nix, riz, has been receiing periodical
gifts of $1,500 and $3,000 from James
unn because an old mining chum of
unn's was taken in there and cared
for when there was no possible chance
of pecuniary reward for th" serice
H NO USE FOB FRILLS
Meanwhile unn lied like a prince
He eschewed fashionable clothing and
such frills * a alet, and lackeys to do
his bidding, but he spent thousands of
dollars in high liing He delighted in
haing diamonds of the clearest hue
and as big as filberts in the front of a
cheap calico shirt With his blazing
diamond studs and cuS buttons, worth
from $5,000 to $6,000 his corduroy
clothes, red and white calico shins,
great russet leather boot*, with trou
sers tucked in them, anil with a mam
moth sombrero 011 bis hc;id, unn was
a conspicuous figure in San Francisco
and Los ngeles He gae one of his
diamonds to  waller in a St Louis
hotel once because the waiter  had
pleased him by some simple serice
When unn traeled he went in style
He frequently hired a whole Pullman
car for himself and some mining camp
friends on a trip across tho continent
He usually gae some caterer carte
blanche orders to stock the car with all
the best eatables ;unl drinkables that
money could buy
 few months ago unn, with se
eral companions, went to Europe and a
short time ago word was receied of his
death in a Paris hospital He made a
will the day before his death, leaing
his mining stock and real estate to two
brothers, ' who woro his friends and
helpers 17 years ago, when James
unn's capital consisted of a shoel, a
pickax and a rude board shanty in a

The Woman 'Who idn't Want Them
In Herself or Others
! Mrs Jennings looked through her
glnssea at her sister, Miss Sprawle,'
with considerable seerity "This
neighborhood has got into strange
ways the last few years, or else I no*
tlce it more as I get further along,"
she snid, "and lest I should get into
Bio same way I want you to remind
nic now and then Mary
i "If you find me backbiting like that
fateful, stingy nnabel Powder or
tucy White, that had better look to
Ber own saucy, bad mannered girl, and

close fisted like the minister's wife,

me in the ery midst of my telling her
fcjjout Sally's twins and went on about
her spindling grandson for most fif
teen minutes without stopping, I want
you should tell me frankly ST "
"nd that's not all," said Mrs Jen
nings as Miss Sprawle opened her
mouth to speak "If you find me get
ting Inquisitie like Helen Lane, that's
asked me three times when my birth
day comes and what year I was born
after my haing to go to the town
records to find out her age, I want you
to mention it freely, and I shall do the
same by you
"If folks don't help each other,

terrupting, Mary, that's growing on

"'He'e always been like that,' she
said 'He's wonderful sick I'e fetch

'much, much better'
"•He'll be getting better,' said I
•Here in the hos'—
" 'He'll die,' she interrupted quickly
"I was glad that he was to die It
would be better for him and for her
She would forget his deformity; she
would foreer hae the memory of
him lying warm upon her breast,
warm and loely; for, in this, memory
is kind to womeq,
" 'You hae—another? 1
" 'No, zur; 'tis me first'
•The child stirred and complained'
She lifted him from her lap, rocked
him, hushed him, drew him close,
rocking him all the time
" 'nd does he talk? I asked
"She looked up in a glow of pride
and answered me, flushing gloriously,
while she turned her shining eyes once
more upon the gasping babe upon her
breastPersonal'
" 'He said "mamma," once!'

Women and the Theater
owedly women are both directly
and indirectly the beat friends of the
theatrical manager If he can please
the feminine portion of his audience
he is tolerably sure of success, for
when a woman likes a play she Induces
her men folk to go to U This being
so, ought not women to be specially
considered in all places of entertain
ment? But it is precisely on the oppo
site lines that the manager commonly
proceeds Men are encouraged to push
and squeeze past and disturb and in
conenience ladles between the acts
because smoking rooms are proided
for them In motf thpaterg Women, on
the other band, are expostulated with
and denounced if they wear hats at a
matinee— London World

WHY WE TREMBLE
The Nerre ctions Superinduced by
Cold, Fear and nger
Cold, ,by stimulating the sensory
nere endings in the skin; produces a
corresponding irritation in the brain
motor centers and by contracting the
blood essels in the skin produces a
temporary excess of blood In the brain
This interferes with the steady flow of
nere force to the muscles, so that the
spasmodic action of these nere cur
rents produces the trembling due to
cold  ~ '"
Of trembling from fear or anger ar
win gies this explanationPersonal "Men dur
ing long generations hae endeaored
to escape from their enemies by flight
or iolent struggling These cause
breathlessness and trembling of the
muscles Wheneer fear is felt the
same results tend to appear through
the force of inheritance and association
Just as furious rage leads persons to
make iolent attacks on the object of
their resentment so in milder cases,
though no such attack may be made,
the beginning of iolent exertion —
namely, trembling of the muscles
tends to show Itself, But the chlei
cause of trembling from fear or anger
Is, according to the same authority,
the interruption or disturbance of the
transmission of nere force from the
cerebro spinal system, due to mental
agitation Why or how these emotions
affect the cerebro spinal system
through the mind In this way is not
known," PersonalV;\
The Flrat Use of Hnpklns
 French writer who eidently was
conseratie and did not welcome the

INSTRUCTE FOR HERST
The action of the democratic state
conention in instructing the Cali
fornia delegation to the national
conention to support Hearst for the
presidential nomination, has ery
materially enhanced the outlook of
the millionaire newspaper owner for
carrying off the honor of being se
lected as the standardbearer at St
Louis Without the backing of the
party's representaties from his own
state, his candidacy would hae been
hopelessly crippled That the in
struction program was pressed to
final ictory in the face of bitter op
position—een in  presence of a
seere repulse of his cohorts on pre
liminary organization — if anything
adds to, rather than detracts from,
the significance of the ictory The
aderse erdict on the chairmanship
reealed to his managers where
their line might be strengthened,
and that they were able to bring
oer enough recruits to their side
before the decisie ote was taken
to change seeming defeat to ictory,
shows a thorough mastery of the
situation, and a resere force in the
background equal to the occasion
That Hearst is unpopular with the
leaders as well as the rank and file
of democracy is eident emocrats
in eery partof the state disown him
as a true exponent of the party
Usually a possible candidate for
president is readily accorded the
unanimous support of his own state
Hearst had to fight, and fight hard,
to get this start on the road to the
nomination But be has reached the
goal of his ambition as far as Cali
fornia is concerned The fight has
been transferred to St Louis He
is not one whit more popular in the
nation than in California part
from his money bags he would not
be thought of as aailable material
That adroit political managers are
in charge of his campaign there is
no question It remains to be seen
whether the tactics successful at
Santa Cruz will not be equally po
tent in the larger arena at St
Louis \ln spite of the bitter per
sonal antagonism, Hearst seems to
be the most talkedof candidate in
the democratic coop, while his chief
competitor, Parker of New York, is
losing ground daily
The republican state conention
in Sacramento this week was har
"monious throughout It was a per
functory affair There was no conten
tion as to the choice for president,
and the delegates assembled to ratify
the wish of the party for the nomina
tion of Theodore Rooseelt for pres
ident mador county expected to
get one of the delegates from the
first congressional district in the
person of E C Voorheis of Sutter
Creek Before the conention as
sembled it was generally conceded
that he would be selected as the rep
resentatie from the mining section
n unwise and illtimed effort was
made in a neighboring county io ig
nore Humboldt, aud monopolize the
delegation for the mining counties
It was intended principally to help
the mador candidate No doubt
Mr Voorheis was the first choice of
Calaeras as well as mador When
the conention assembled, J C Bull
of Humboldt and C Clinch of Neada
were elected without a contest

UNIONISM
In union there is strength, and
strength portrays endurance, but when
strength is wrongly applied a little
skill or tact may oercome it From
time immemorial men hae united their
forces— skill and capital— for mutual
protection, for the adancement of
science and art, and for the fostering
of enterprises that could not hae
otherwise been carried out This has
been the principal means of placing the
United States in the forefront of cii
lized nations It has been the means
of eleating labor, of increasing capital,
of educating the masses and placing
the children of the poorest beggar on
our streets upon a leel with those of
the millionaire who occupies a princely
palace We are in faor of unionism
in its broadest sense; much good has
come from it io the past, and the pres
ent is full of opportunities that will re
quire combinations of all the resources
of mankind to carry out
Less than two years ago mador
county seemed to be enjoying her full
est measure of quiet and prosperity
Her mines were running unceasingly,
some yielding a fair return for money
expended, others drawing from the
stockholders each month a sufficient
amount with which to keep them in
operation, but all working steadily and
contentedly Wood and timber men
felt secure in cutting their supplies in
adance, thus allowing them to season
before time for deliery, enabling them
to handle larger and more profitable
loads t the same time new capital
was coming in, and new prospects were
being operated
But certainty has changed to uncer
tainty  paid agitator came, and by
his barks and growls induced tbeu to
band themseles together under the
head of labor union; sowed the seed
of discontent, and managed to desert
the field before the hardest time But
agitators are like mush rooms — they
spring up i a nightrand instead of
one we now hae many, 'some paid, some
hoping to be paid in the future
When a boy gets his first pair of
boots he must wade through the same
stream, or a deeper one, than that
through which he has often heard his
father tell about wading Just so with
these union men They hae heard
about strikes, and the first thing to be
considered was a strike It came, and
hundreds of men laid down their picks,
shoels and drills, and walked the
streets demanding what should be done
and commanding what should not be
done, and all the time, perhaps un
consciously, losing the respect and con
fidence of employers whose interests
they were jeopardizing It is said that
at the Kennedy and other mines men
who had held their positions for years,
and reared their families on their hard
earned salaries, shed tears when they
were compelled to quit their work
Why should they not weep? They had
sacrificed their merican manhood;
they were no longer free men They
must now yield to the nod and beck of
scheming agitators, some of whom
perhaps neer did a day's work, al
though they had drawn many a day's
pay
Yes, the union, like other beneolent
societies, is a benefit, so long as it keeps
within bounds, but when it oersteps
its bounds it becomes a menace to eery
industry in the community wherein it
exists So long as it protects and de
fends, so long as it renders proper as
sistance to its members in seeking em
ployment, so long as it assists its needy
members, so long as it looks after the
widows and orphans of deceased mem
bers, so long as it teaches the principle
of lie and let lie, just so long will it
be a power in the land, and no longer
If on the other hand it becomes a
dictator, a usurper of power that be
longs to others; if it assumes to say
that its members shall do all the work
to be had and that outsiders must
stare, and at the same time be the
sole judge as to who shall become Its
members, it then places itself in the
position of the strong against the weak
— the ery thing which the organiza
tion pretends to oercome No one
will deny the right of any person to
better his condition wheneer oppor
tunity offers, but eery reasonable per
son must concede the right of another
to take a position made acant by one
who has oluntarily surrendered it
Quit if you are dissatisfied with your
place; secure a better one If you can, It
is your undeniable priilege to do so
but do not try to destroy an industry
that may be the means of hundreds of
families gaining a lielihood for years
 t the Fremont mine for instance,
thousands of dollars hae been expend
ed In this enterprise, and before it is
put on a paying basis the men walk out
on account of a triial matter that
could in no way concern the manage
ment The mine is now closed on ac
count of the union assuming tho role of
dictator If those who put money Into
a concern cannot say how and by whom
It shall be worked, then things hae
come to an intolerable pass, and nothing
remains to be done except to appeal to
a power more potent than union edicts —
a power that will see that equal justice
Is done to all

RYTOWN
rytown, May 10
 I will endeaor once more to send a
few items, to conince the readers of
the Ledger that rytown is still on the
map and a few of the old residenters
still among us
Most of the strangers who attended
the grand opening ball gien by Frank
Gazzera on last Saturday night were
surely coninced that there are more
pretty girls and good dancers in ry
town than in any town in the golden
west The occasion was gotten up for
the purpose of dedicating the new hall
and christening the new floor, which
was considered by all present the best
dance floor in the county It was made
of ]Jx3 Oregon pine, and almost as
smooth as glass The butcher boy, the
foreman of the Pocahontas mine, and
"Shorty" Bicknell measured their full
length, breadth and thickness on the
floor without een breaking their backs
By ten o'clock in the eening more
than forty ladles were present; among
them were noticed many from Sutter
Creek, mador, lone and Plymouth
t midnight all repaired to the ban
quet hall, where a splendid chicken and
raiola supper was sered, which all
seemed to enjoy The music gien by
Grainger's full orchestra was first class
Frank Gazzera is desering of much
credit for the real enterprise that he
has displayed in inesting such an
amount of money in this place  He
surely has a pointer that rytown is
going to boom in the near future, or as
soon as the strike is declared off
Many of our citizens who went to the
Fremont and Goer mines this morn

the cry of his wife suddenly appeared
on the scene (Scene 2) In the next

FELL OWN THE SHFT
Chas F Goss Meets eath in the rgo
naut by Falling 260 Feet
The rgonaut mine through its
whole history has been remarkably free
from casualties of a fatal character
On Tuesday morning the second fatal
accident occurred since the present
company started work, the ictim being
Chas F Goss, a man well known in
this icinity Exactly how the mishap
occurred is not known, as there was no
eye witness to tell the story It oc
curred at the change of shift— 7 o'clock
in the morning Goss, Michel Banso
ich, and another were working in the
south compartment at the 1690 leel
They were easing the shaft timbers —
that is loosening the ground back of
the timbers so as to reliee the pressure
The skip or tank traels in the center
compartment', so men employed in the
south compartment are in no danger
whateer of being struck by the skip
The shaft timbors separating the com
partments aro so constructed in the
rgonaut that it is difficult, indeed al
most impossible, to pass from one com
partment to the other except at the
arious stations nd yot the unfor
tunate ictim fell in the center com
partment, as eidenced by his boots
which were found in that compartment,
torn from his feet in his fearful plunge
to death It is supposed to hae hap
pened in this wise The shift's work
was done The skip was coming down,
deliering men going to work at the
arious leels, and taking aboard those
who had finished their shift Kanso
ich says he called to Goss, "The skip
is coming" Goss thereupon endeaor
ed to get to the station a few feet below
him, for the purpose of being taken to
the top Whether he slipped into the
shaft after reaching the station, or fell
while making his way to the station is
unknown He fell 255 feet— from the
1690 leel to 15 feet below the 1930 leel
His neck was broken, and his head
badly battered by contact with the
timbers He was no doubt dead before
he reached the end of his fall
Coroner Huborty held an inquest the
saipe morning, before the following
jurorsPersonal  Ginocchio, V M Colt, W
U ufreno, P Podesta, Jos Plant,
W P Peek, M Newman and K C
Hust fter hearing all the testimony
that could be produced to throw light
on the tragedy, the jury returned a
erdict that deceased came to his death
by accidentally falling down the shaft,
and that no blame was attached to
any one therefor
eceased had been employed at the
rgonaut eer since work was resumed
last fall He leaes a wife and two
children to mourn his death He was
a member of tho  O U W, and in
sured for $1000 He was also a member
of the miners' union, and was buried
under tho auspices of these orders on
Thursday afternoon"
eath of John Jeffery
John Jeffory, a young man well and
faorably known throughout the
greater portion of mador county,
passed away at tho St Joseph hospital
in Stockton on Wednesday morning
after a brief illness Just two weeks
before bis death Mr Jeffery quit his
work at the Kennedy mine, complain
ing of a seere pain In his side The
doctor prescribed, and for a few days
eerything seemed to be alright Rea
lizing that his ailment was a serious
case of appendicitis that called for an
operation, his physician adised him to
go to Stockton for that purpose On
Sunday morning friends started with
him for Stockton, where thiy arried
about 11 a m fter a careful exami
nation by the hospital physicians his
case was considered so serious that
they decided to operate at once, and at
the same time giing his friend, rthur
Perkin, to understand that there was
little hope of his recoery He rallied
after the operation, and seemed much
improed until Tuesday, when the un
faorable change took place, and death
released him at 7 o'clock a m Wed
desday His remains were at once pre
pared for shipment, and brought to
Jackson the same day
Mr Jeffery was a natie of England,
3 years of age He came to merica
15 years ago, and for the past 7 years
has resided in and around Jackson,
whore by his honest dealings and gen
tlemanly ways he had endeared himself
to all with whom he came in contact
His parents lie at Gunpis Lake, Corn
wall, England, while his only brother
resides in Now York City He was a
member of the Forestors of merica
and the Jackson Miners' Union, under

RITCHEY
Ritchey, May 10
We took an early morning ride
through tho lower rier section of the
county Passiug the old Northup
place we noticed the beautiful orange
groe there, white with blossoms Oh,
such a breath of fragrance, and many
glowing yellow oranges, yet hanging
among , the glossy leaes and snowy
blossoms Truly it was a sight to
make an easterner think of paradise
Further on tho mellow fields wore being
marked off for corn, melons, and that
great essential to an adequate Thanks
giing—the prosaic pumpkin The
interening fields were coered fence
high with wheat and barley, the latter
already turning yellow t length a
smell — such as we are told characterizes
tho infernal regions — greeted us
ense sulphurous apor obscured the
ision; scant yellow egetation, dead
and dying trees What did it mean?
Wo determined to find out We droe
on, and noticed that the egetation
gradually became healthier, and that
we saw no more dead trees, and on
eery side signs of a bountiful harest
Returning in the afternoon the wind
was blowing in the opposite direction,
and we saw at our right a kind of basin
or hollow in the hills bare and brown,
deoid of all egetation sae the dead
brush and tree trunks, black as if
swept by tire, and In the center the
works of the Camp Seco mine In
quiry elicited the information from a
group of miners that between one hun
dred and one hundred and twentyfie
men are employed in and around the
mine How we wished to isit it, but
we did not like to go alone Quite a
large area around the mine is entirely
destitute of egetation; then succeeds
a belt that is sparsely coered with
yellow sickly weeds, and grass about
an Inch high, and where a few old pines
still lie Gradually the egetation
assumes a greener hue t Mr
Nichols' place, where we used to see
grain a couple of feet high at this time
of year, there was not much but sickly
looking "poerty grass" about six
inches high, stared and yellow looking
We were glad to get out of the
"smoked" area Into the country of
thrifty grain and grass Tho sight of

accident at tho Bunker Hill mine by
which rthur Stone, the acting fore
man, was instantly killed while em
ployed in the shaft, we are enabled to
gleam the following particulars The
following persons constituted the juryPersonal
J R Tregloan, B White, W E
Whltehead, O E Martin, Chas Gillis
and G C ais It appears that on
the fatal morning rthur Stone was in
the shaft at the 800 foot leel Louis
Galli, an experienced machinist, was at
the engine Two miners, John Chey
noweth and Louis Chasa, were at the
200 foot leel, employed in taking old
timbors out of the tuiiWl at that point,
and putting new oues in their place
s the old timbers were remoed they
were loaded on the skip and sent on
top They had already sent up two
sticks, 8 feet long and 20 inches thick,
to tho surface They were employed
in loading the third, when the mishap
occurred They wanted the skip low
ered 6or 8 Inches, so that they could
tilt the timber oer into the skip
while it was below them Two bells
was gien, the signal to lower, and the
engineer promptly responded by start
ing to lower nother bell was theu
rung, and the bells were so close to
gether that the engineer interpreted
the signals as 21 bells, which means to
hoist, which he at once started to do,
ery slowly, raising the skip some ten
or twele feet Tho skip, owing to this
confusion of signals, was hoisted away
from the men before they could load
the timber It was too heay for thorn
to hold as It hung oer the shaft, and
In this way it fell Whether It struck
Stone at the 800 leel, or whether the
ictim fell down the shaft as the re
sult of the falling timber, is nut known
The probability is— from the terribly
mangled condition of the body— that
he was hit by the timber The body
was found 30 feet bulow the 800 ioel,
stradding a sill, with his head hanging
down He was dead when found The
inestigation disclosed that the acci
dent was caused by faulty signaling
The 21 bells were intended by the
workers bylow for two signals— 2 to
lower, and 1 to stop— whereas they
were gien in such quick succession
that the engineer — who has to be go
erned entirely by the signals—under
stood them as one signal — the cus
tomary signal to hoist Tho jury found
a erdict of accidental death, and
exonerated the mine management from
all blame in connection therewith
Bench Warrant
The first bench warrant ordered is
sued by the superior court of mador
county during the administration of
county clerk Culbert was made out
Wednesday, directing Sheriff Norman
to produce John Pritchard, of Ply
mouth, in court on Thursday at 10
o'clock a m, as a witness in tho John
Ekel case fter testifying he was
ordered ito the custody of the sheriff
until the case was concluded, and at
the termination of the trial he was sen
tenced to 2 hours in the county jail
for contempt of court ;"

The Eailroad Project
It is freely reported on the street
that a hitch has occurred in connection
with the construction of the railroad
from lone to Jackson and Sutter Creek
by the newly organized lone and East
ern Railroad Company The corps of
sureyors who hae been making a
surey for a route from lone to Sutter
Creek by way of Mount Echo for the
past two weeks, wore all laid off last
Tuesday This action came suddenly
and unexpectedly The notice of appli
cation for franchise has been published
the required length of time in the
Stokton Mail, and the bids for the
franchise will be receied by the super
isors at their next regular meeting on
June 6 The reason for the stoppage
of work at this time is not clear It is
said that the parties who were expect
ed to inest in the enterprise are not
satisfied with the terms of the fran
chise as outlined in the published notice;
that the right of way in regard to the
highways and streets is too restrictie,
and that work has been suspended
until the franchise can be atnondod to
suit It is hardly probable that this is
the true cause of the trouble, as the
nature of the concessions to be granted
by the superisors has been definitely
known for three weeks, during which
time actie operations hae been push
ed ahead It is rumored that the com
pany is to be reorganized, and new ap
plication for franchise made Both
Jackson ennis and Wilford ennis
hae been away seeral days this week,
presumably on this railroad business
"Tale of a Whale and Whale of a Tale"
We call attention to an article taken
from the Saturday Globe of Utlca, New
York, relating the antics of one James
unn, an alleged prodigal millionaire,
who died recently in Paris The story
was sent to the Ledger by some un
known party, probably for the reason
that mador county is mentioned as
the scene of this eccentric man's rise
from poerty to wealth If other parts
of the story are as truthful as those
touching mador county, the whole
may be branded as a Munchausen yarn
from beginning to end To those who
hae lied in mador county for the
last twenty or thirty yoars the huge
story will be read with amusement, as
showing what preposterous ideas of
California men and conditions are
swallowed by the easterners Here we
neer heard of a bonanza known as the
Big Jennie lode, which is gien as the
foundation of unn's career of wealth
The incidents mentioned in connection
with the last smallpox outbreak in
mador county are also fabrications
The days of '9 palo into insignificance
by the side of this gilded yarn of Cal
ifornia doings which is being dished up
for the edification of tho eastern people

It Comes From Latin and Originally
Meant Cope or Canopy
The word "chapel" comes from the
low Latin capella, a cope or canopy,
and was applied to a recess or chapel
attached to the altar >s
Used originally of the place where
the cappa or cope of St Martin was
presered, the word came in the eighth
century to signify any sanctuary where
holy relics were kept and thence a con
secrated building connected with a
church or cathedral t this period
also domestic oratories and places of
worship for such corporate bodies as
colleges began to be called chapels
part from its present day meaning,
as applied to any place of worship
which is not a parish church, such as a
chapel of ease or a nonconformist
chapel, the word denotes the ecclesi
astical staff of a soereign, the sacred
office recited by the pope with his
household and the working staff of a
printing office, because the first one in
England was set up by Caxton in
Westminster abbey
The Vice of Nagging;
Nagging may or may not be a ice
of the thin,' as a famous physician sug
gests, but that there is some truth in
his theory that there is a scientific
basis for this ugly habit seems likely
"Perfect health," he says, "has as one
of its factors content of mind  ner
ous man or woman who is anxious,
discontented, gloomy, dissatisfied, wor
ried from any cause, cannot enjoy good
health This mental turmoil produces
as one of its primary effects on the
body an inability to digest food prop
erly The blood which should supply
the force necessary for the function
of digestion is continually drawn away
from the stomach by excitement In
the brain, and the woman who nags
suffers While there be those whose
tendency to lay on fat is so great that
nothing will stop it a nagging man or
woman is generally thin Their habit
of mind has partially stared their
bodies"

 story which belongs to a time se
eral years ago when an English duke
was a much sought after personage In
New York society is told by Mr James
L Ford in "The Brazen CalfPersonal"
This duke, contemptuously noting
the eagerness with which New York
ers fawned upon him, had formed tbe
habit of sting out to dinner without
troubling biinself to put on eening
dress  l;iy had inited him to din
ner without knowing of this peculiar
ity and whs awaiting his ar 1 when
her butler opened the door and cast a
glance at her oer the Wads of Inter
eningPersonal guests which saia plainly that
something was wrong
She hastened into the hall to find tbe
fluke standing there clad in the checked
sack suit and flaming red tie which
had seemed to him "good enough" for
a dinner party of merican calf wor
shipers This woman, howeer, had
presence of mind, and she adanced
upon him radiant and smiling
"No," she said decisiely as she took
him by the huud; "I won't accept any
excuses You'e come round to tell mo
why it is that you can't dine here to
night, and it's eer so much nicer of
you to do that, than just to send a note
The dinner's a little late, and you'e
just time to go home and dress and be
back here before we begin"
The nobleman opened his mouth to
reply, but bis hostess shut him off in a
secondPersonal "No; you needn't make any
explanations or excuses Remember,
you'e only twenty minutes, so you
must hurry"  1,
 moment later the astounded duke
found himself hurrying toward his ho
tel and perhaps wondering what new
social forco it was that was impelling
him in that direction
 WOMN'S POINT OF VIEW
The Things That Most Impressed a
Feminine Tourist broad
"What impressed you most?" said
the gushing girl to the woman who
had just returned from a trip abroad
"You must hae seen such wonderful
things"
The we nan who had traeled
thought di Personalply a few minutes; then
she said slowlyPersonal "I think it was the
lack of napkins in Scotland Yes, that
was it Jfy dear, there isn't a sign of
a napkin oi the tables in Scotland If
you ask for one, you may get It, and
then again you may not I was en
tertained in the homes of some of the
finest people, in Scotland, and neer a
napkin did I get  J
"The next most impressie thing
was the size of the coins in England
I used up ii great deal of good, ner
ous energy trying ways and means to
stuff those cart wheels into my little
purse One day, when my pocketbook
had become unusually clumsy, I be
came almost hysterical", and that night
I dreamed that I was using belt
buckles for the coin of the realm
"There's one queer thing, though
You know I neer could get it througli
my head how one made double change
You know what I mean— some one
gies you too 'much change, and then
you gie them some money, and it's
all right or something of that sort
Well, I neer could understand that
process in good United States money,
with which I'm more or less familiar,
but oer there in England I accom
plished that feat again and again
without a tremor on't nsk me how
I did it I don't know It just came
to me Can I do it now in United
States money? No, I can't I left that
special ability behind in England"—

It may be said that a seat among
the seenty (they call it a charge) costs
about 3,000,000 francs ($600,000) or
sometimes 2,500,000, and a charge
earns from 5 to 15 per cent (net) a
year, so that tbe annual profits are
from $30,000 to $00,000, or more In ex
ceptional years But these are usually
diided among seeral associates, for
It rarely happens that an agent is the
sole owner of his seat More often he
has paid for only half of it or a third
of it and has three or four silent part
ners, who own the rest and who may
again hae subpartners, so that you
will hear of a person owning an eighth
or a sixteenth of a seat or een a thir
tysecond, these seing simple inest
ments that carry no rights or prii
leges on the bourse
s to procuring a charge, the thing
has none of the Stock Exchange sim
plicity, where the main requirement
for getting a seat is to be able to pay
for it Here a candidate must be a
Frenchman and at least twentyfie
years old He must hae sered four
years in certain forms of business He
must be personally acceptable to the
agent from whom he would purchase
the seat and often to his family, in

 RICH GOL MINE
For Seeral Years Eager Fortune
Seekers Worked Oer It
 tale is told of a rich gold mine in
Idaho with a ledge of ore which once
extended aboe the surface of the
ground in a clear, solid ridge seeral
feet high and entirely distinct from tbe
surrounding formation This ledge was
long and unbroken and lay directly
across the course which hundreds of
prospectors took eery year to reach
other gold fields This obstruction of
rock, the great alue of which was
long unknown, was too high to be sur
mounted by pack animals, so the pros
pectors cut a trail directly through it
For seeral years these eager gold seek
ers passed backward and forward oer
this trail in search of gold mines One
night a prospector camping near this
ledge of rock picked up a bit of it and
from force of habit took it to a creek
near by and washed it Then be exam
ined the stone, and, to his great aston
ishment, he found "colors" in it— bits
of sparkling gold The prospector does
not mistake gold when he sees it He
is not deluded by iron crystals or bits
of mica, as the "tenderfoot" frequent
ly is The gold sparkle is clearer and
brighter than that of any other miner
al, and it is the same In sunshine and
shadow
The prospector, tremendously excit
ed, broke off more pieces of the ledge
and found more of It bearing free gold
Then be located his claim, and that
was Kie beginning of a rich mine Yet
for years the sagest of prospectors had
passed oer this trail through the cut
in this ledge, neer suspecting its al
ue, although by its ery prominence it
seemed to inite inspection — Leslie's

WILLING TO HELP
n Old Seaman's Scheme to Win
Honor For a Faorite
n amusing story is told of an old
seaman on one of the United States
cruisers in the north tlantic squad
ron, lie was not a person of wide af
fections, but he had a warm place in
his heart for a young ensign who had
been kind to him in many little ways
One day a landsman fell from the
rigging to the water, and as he could
not swim he would hae been drowned
but for a young officer who sprang in
after him and held him up till assist
ance came
Later the young officer receied a
complimentary letter from the secre
tary of the nay Eery one rejoiced
but the old seaman; he coeted the let
ter for his ensign
"That's a nice thing to hae, a letter
like that," he said a few days later
"You ought to hae one"
"I don't quite see how I can get one,"
laughed the ensign 'z'Personal'*k Personal
"Well, see here," said the old man
eagerly "Tomorrow night I'll be in
the main chains, fussing with some
thing or other, and I might fall in, and
you could jump after me"
"That would be ery good of you,"
said, the ensign graely, "but you see,
I'm not a good swimmer by any
means"
"Ho, that's no matter!" said the old
seaman "I'll hold you up till the boat
comes"
CRCKE VOICES
 Lack of Muscular Control Is What
Causes the Break
The pitch of the human oice de
pends primarily upon the number of
ibrations per second of the ocal
cords, and these, in their turn, depend
on the length, size and degree of ten
sion of the cords, which increase in
length with the growth of the larynx
One of the deepest bass notes, from
the greater length of the cords, has
only eighty double ibrations a second,
while a soprano oice can gie 092
such ibrations in the same time
The size of a lad's larynx Is, roughly,
that of a woman's, but when the pip
ing schoolboy is shooting up into man
hood bis lPersonalu'ynx grows rapidly and the
ocal cords become elongated nearly in
the proportion of three and a half to
two The cartilages by which their
tension is regulated also share in this
growth, as is seen by the swelling of
the so called "dam's apple" \'
Now, all these parts do not increase
with equal rapidity; hence the muscu
lar control, which must be ery exact,
is rendered uncertain and the oice is
said to "break"  similar change
takes place in the case of women, but
ery much less in amount, and a fur
ther compensation in the formation of
the upper part of the larynx seres to
disguise the effect
COLUMBUS' CREWS
One Engllxhmnn and One Irishman
Were mong Their Number
n Englishman and an Irishman
were among the sturdy 120 ad
enturers who sailed with Columbus
in the three small hundred tonners
This may hae been due to the well
known fact that nothing brings men of
different races together more than
maritime and commercial enterprise,
or, still more probably, because they
were swept in at Palos, when Colum
bus put the press gang to work, as he
was authorized to do by Ferdinand
and Isabella
The names of these men, as gien
by Naarrete, were Jallarte de Lajes,
Ingles (probably rthur Lake, Eng
lish), and Guillermo Ires, naturel de
Galney, en Irlanda (probably William
Herries or Rice, natie of Galway, In
Ireland)
These two men were among the
forty whom Columbus left behind In
the fort constructed In Hispaniola be
fore he sailed for Europe, who all met
their death at the hands of the naties
before the great discoerer returned,
owing to their disregard of his express
directions
The Cocoanut Tree
There is no tree so widely distributed
throughout the tropics as the cocoanut
Een on remote atolls of the south
seas, which geologists say were only
recently formed by the subsidence of
a olcano and the growth of coral up
from its base, one finds the cocoanut
The parent tree leaning oer the beach
of one tropical island drops its fruit
into the sea, to hae the nut carried
away perchance halfway round the
world Then in some faraway place
the waes cast the cocoanut ashore to
sprout and propagate another forest
after its own kind
The pple
The apple is not considered to be a
complete food in itself, but on the food
list it has a alue far aboe the nutri
ment It possesses pples aid the
stomach in the digestion of other foods,
and therefore the best results are ob
tained from eating them after rather
than before meals fter partaking of
an unusually heay dinner the eating
of ,n apple will be found to facilitate
an early digestion and afford great re
lief from the sufferings attendant upon
indigestion
Too Mucli Reallam
"o you not feel at times," remarked
