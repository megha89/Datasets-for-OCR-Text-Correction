JACKSON, AMADOU COUNTY CAI/LFOIfcNIA, FRIDAY AUGUST 9; 1901
A BIT OF DIPLOMACY
CLEVER TRICK OF AN ENGLISH GOV
ERNOR OF THE PORT OF ADEN
Tbe Cnrlona Story Connected 'With
the White House of Bab-el-Mandeb
A Monument of the Undoing; of a
French Admiral "
On tbe foreshore of the Arabian coast
in the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, at the
couthern entrance to tbe Red  sea,
Manfls a large white house concerning
which the travelers to the far east may
hear a curious story In the middle of
the nineteenth century", when  M de
Lesseps, after many difficulties, had
successfully floated the - Suez Canal
company, the governor of the British
port of Aden, about 100 miles distant,
was surprised one morning by the visit
of a French 6quadron of very unusual
size for that part of tbe orient which,
having encountered a terrific storm off
Sofcotra, had put, in for repairsPersonal 
Iv the mind of the governor curiosity
was at once aroused as to tbe destina
tion of so large a command, a curiosity
which increased as be found it impossi
ble to extract any further information
from the French admiral or his officers
beyond the statement that they were
upon an ordinary cruise, an explana
tion which tbe former was not tbe
least inclined to believe
Firm In the belief, therefore, that
some political move of great impor
tance was afloat if not afoot, the gov
ernor, in order first of all to gain time,
gay orders to go very tortolselike on
the repairs and then set to work to take
the Frenchmen off their guard by/giv
ing a succession of such entertainments
as both bis slender means and the aw
ful barrenness of the place would af
ford
But though at the end of two weeks
the French and British officers had got
upon tbe best of terms the Immediate
destination of the French squadron re
mained as much of a mystery to the
governor of Aden as before, and in
spite of all possible delay the repairs
were nearly completed
Now, it happened that the wife of
the governor possessed an Irish maid,
who had been receiving attentions
from one of the French petty officers —
attentions which the girl did not regard
seriously It occurred to the governor
that by such means something might
be learned of his unexpected visitor's
plans, and a private conversation be
tween tbe governor's wife and her
maid resulted In another between the
latter and her French admirer, by
which it was discovered that Perim Is
land was tbe objective point
At this information tbe governor
opened his eyes wide indeed, for, if tbe
Suez canal were cut through, Perim, as
commanding tbe southern entrance to
the Red sea In the middle of tbe strait
of Bab-el-Mandeb, would be a place of
great strategic importance, over which,
without doubt, It was tbe Intention of
the French admiral to hoist the tri
color
Secretly giving orders, therefore, for
a gunboat to immediately embark a de
tachment of soldiers and steal away in
the night for Perim Island, the govern
or then announced a farewell banquet
and ball for the day but one following,
a final act of courtesy with which the
French admiral would willingly have
dispensed, for be was anxious to sail,
but wblcb be could not well refuse on
account of the use he had made of the
British supplies and machinery at
Aden
j So the dinner and party In due course
came off, the governor being in high
spirits, because in tbe meantime be bad
received tbe news of the occupation of
Perim, which under the circumstances
would surely be followed by the longed
for promotion, and the French admiral
was equally happy, for he hoped on the
morrow to add tbe same Important lit
tle speck of land to the dominion of bis
own country, thereby covering bis
breast with the stars and himself with
maritime glory
Next day, after an Interchange of
cordial farewells, the French squadron
sailed away to an apparently unknown
destination, until, when clear of the
land, tbe course was laid full speed di
rect for Perim island
Then what was the dismay and dis
appointment of the French admiral and
his officers when, on coming In sight of
their destination, they beheld tbe Brit
ish flag flying and a company of sol
diers drawn up to give them a proper
salute It is said the French admiral
was so mortified at being thus outwit
ted that be first flung his cocked hat
overboard and then followed it himself
into the sea
| Be this as it may, as Perim was
clearly already occupied by the British,
the only counter move which the
French could make was to take posses
sion of a strip of the foreshore on the
opposite Arabian coast where they
built tbe fortified white house in ques
tion, but as tbe place was entirely at
the mercy of tbe guns on Perim lslanij
it was shortly abandoned, to remain to
this day as a monument of a French
admiral's undoing— Exchange

Value of the Footbath
To break up a cold, which certainly
disfigures the face of beauty, as well
as a valuable adjunct in tbe removal
of facial eruptions, the nightly foot
bath is invaluable The largest sweat
glands of the body are located in the
palms, armpits and soles of tbe feet
It is of primary importance that the
multitudinous outlets should be unclog
ged Where facial eruption exists and
the whole attention is devoted toward
the care of the face, every pore is ac
tive and open to afford the escape of
clogging impurities
This Is all wrong The feet should
be made the gateway for the escape of
effete deposits The temperature of
the footbath should range from 105 to
110 degrees or as hot as can be en
dured with comfort Should there ex
ist chronic profuse and offensive per
spiration, add a lump of washing soda
to neutralize the acid exudation The
feet should be rubbed briskly to draw
the blood down, to the extremities
Cool tbe water before withdrawing" the
feet, so that they may not become un
duly tender Rub long and thoroughly
with a soft towel
Good pedal circulation is a foe to
corns and chilblains Frequent warm
footbaths prevent callouses and make
walking a pleasure For beauty and
complexion take extraordinary care of

"Yes," said Tom ruefully, "but every
body knows that you wear trousers"

The man from the country took his
green necktie and his best girl into the
restaurant, and, like some other men,
;he was disposed to be facetious at the
waiter's expense
"Waiter," he said, "I want you to
bring me a boiled elephant"
"Yessir," replied the waiter, perfect
ly unmoved
"And, waiter, bring it on toast"
"Yesslr"
Then he stood there like a statue for
a minute
"Well," said the man, "are you not
going to bring it?"
•"Yessir"
"Why don't you, then?"
"Order Is, sir, that we get pay in ad

land Meeting an Intelligent looking
Irishman, 1 Informed him of my mis
sion, saying that my ancestors emigrat

THE CIRCUS HABIT
INDIANS HAVE THE WILDEST CRAZE
FOR THE TENTED SHOWS
After the Bed Men tbe Nefrroes "Will
Go to tbm Great ent Lengths to See
the Performance,' and Third Place
,! Held by Chinamen' Personal -
"You may talk about your city circus
goers," said the old circus man, "but
tbe Indian, tbe wild, untutored red man
of the plains, has got them all beaten
to death There's no circus goer In the
world like the North American aborig
ine He  will j travel farther, endure
more privations and skimp himself
harder to get the price of admission
than any other human being In the
world What's more, I believe he real
ly enjoys the circus better than the ne
gro, though be doesn't make any fuss
over it" Personal /' ' ' J '
 "The negro,*- as  every man
knows, will sell the family cook stove
to get money to see the elephant, but
the Indian will barter off his papoose,
bis squaw or even his most cherished
possession, his horse, to get a ticket
After the negro comes the Chinaman
The Mexicans, too, are not slow In re
sponding to the toot of the calliope The
laziest greaser- on the Texas border,
who never paid a debt in bis life, bobs
up promptly on circus day with his 50
cents, though nobody knows where he
got it But tbe Indian is the greatest
circus fiend of aIL
"In the west our circus is known
among the Indians as the heap big
bfothers' show'- It Is the only circus
that attracts the red man, and be waits
for its yearly appearance as confidently
as he awaits the return of spring In
Mlssoula,- Mon, one of our regular
stands, fully one-half of the audience is
made up of Indians They come from
as far as 200 miles on horseback and
even on foot,, starting Personal on their long
Journey days before the circus date and
arriving promptly on the morning of
tbe day of exhibition
"On circus day it is a case of every
man for himself with the Indians The
lord of the tepee brings enough trinkets
in tbe shape of moccasins and bows
and arrows to peddle around town and
in this way gets money for his own ad
mission ticket His squaw brings wil
low baskets and has to hustle for her
own ticket They generally come in
couples astride of a pony, and if the
market is overcrowded with Indian rel
ics they will sell the nag
"When the show trains arrive in
these western towns early In tbe morn
ing 200 and 300 tents have already been
pitched by tbe Indians, some of which
have arrived the night before Their
little colony Is almost as interesting as
the circus itself It is a veritable ba
zaar of relics and papoose exhibitions
While the old squaws are getting
breakfast the children are playing
games and tbe chiefs are taking their
knlckknacks to the market They are
the first ones after the doors of the big
tents are opened to land on tbe blue
planks They fill a good part of the
arena, and they never move during the
entire performance Applause is un
known to them They make as little
show of enthusiasm as their brothers
In wood in front of the white man's ci
gar stores If the trick elephant were
to climb the center pole, they would no
doubt enjoy the performance, but they
would make no more show of surprise
than if they were molded from clay If
the performing mule were to walk out
on the hippodrome track and make a
concert announcement in the Indian
tongue, they would only grunt
"After the show is over the chiefs
proceed to fill their skins with tbe
white man's firewater, and tbe squaws
with tbe papooses wait on the lumber

ALL IS SELFISHNESS
The Wise Man's Theory and How It
'Was Exploded
"After all," said the wise man, "what
Is it but selfishness? The optimist who
goes through life whistling and singing
songs of cheer is not entitled to any
special credit, because it Is a pleasure
to him to bo happy If it didn't malje
him glad to be happy," he wouldn't be
that way  So you see selfishness lies
at tbe bottom of his good cheer
"Then there Is the pessimist Is be
discouraged because be thinks it Is his
duty to mankind to paint dark pic
tures? Not at all His is another clear
case of selfishness He gratifies him
self by being unhappy and trying to
make others so Love, too Is selfish
ness  The maiden doesn't love the man
to make him glad It's her own happi
ness that she promotes in looking upon
him as the noblest work of God | Man's
love for woman has back of it the same
selfish motive
"So, too, the philanthropist's love of
the world He loves it and loves to do
great things for it because It gives him
a satisfaction to know that he is doing
well
"Consider It from whatever stand
point you please, and you must always
arrive at the same conclusion Every
thing that man does he does selfishly
It is always a case of gratifying his
own inclinations It"— 
Just then the wise man turned a som

I thought I saw one defect Crane

all, according to my thinking In keep-
Ing with the imitation of Plumb, who
always wore the characteristic broad
brimmed hat of tbe southerner One
evening when Crane, Tngalls Plumb
and myself happened to be dining to
gether I remarked to Crane about the
matter of the high hat
" 'You really ought not to wear it
for It is not in keeping with tbe char
acter," said I 'You ought to wear one
like Plumb's'
"Crane did not say much In answer,
but when be arose from the table be
reached out for Plumb's hat and calm
ly put It on Leaving his own bat for
Plumb, Crane went off down tbe street
with the old felt affair jammed down
over his forehead Tbe senator was
too surprised to offer objection The

Tiie name of the hero of this anec
dote I shall not give you, for he has
long since been gathered to bis fathers
Let it suffice Personal that in~ his heyday } he
was one^of the ! greatest tenors 'Who
ever sang to a breathless and enthusi
astic audience He had a penchant
however, for the retl, red wine, which
hi the end proved his undoing and ulti
mately provided a pathetic ending for
an otherwise great career In bis prime
his drinking seemed only to affect his
legs, but never bis head or voice 'Ha
could always stag and sing true, but at
times he bad no more ability to guido
his wandering footsteps than has a
sufferer in the last stages of locomotor

  At one time, when he was singing
Faust to Emnm Abbott's Marguerite^
he appeared at the opera boose in an
apparently hopeless  condition - Th
management 'was wild, but tbere was
no one to take bis place, and so they,
had to chance it with him as Faust
All went well until they came to that
scene where Faust, tn leaving Margue
rite, crosses the stage and then, giving
way to an impulse, rushes back and
kisses Marguerite yet once again era
taking his departure ' ;-->
Faust on this occasion got to the oth
er side of the stage all right, but trou
ble arose when he tried to get back
Marguerite sits in the window of her
cottage, and Faust comes back and
kisses her through the window Faust
measured the distance with a wabbling
eye, but made a start when his cua
was given Then he seemed to low
control of himself One-quarter way,
across he was trotting, one-half wajj
the trot was a run, and the remainder
of the way it had become a gallop- ,
Up to this point Miss Abbott stood
her ground bravely, but that rapidly,
approaching figure awed her, and with
a frightened scream she fled Faust
poor Faust, charged on He reached
the place be had last seen Marguerite
and essayed to clasp the atmosphere la
outstretched arms Then his impetus
carried him through the window, and
all that the astounded audience looked
upon were his waving legs  Somebody
pushed him back, and, absolutely un
disturbed, he finished the opera, sing-
Ing in an unusually superb  manner;
Not so with the unfortunate Margue
rite, however, for from then on she was
suffering from a case of "rattles, 1 *

THE CALAVERAS SCOOP
•The Chronicle of last week at
tempted to justify the officers of that
xounty in the scoop of "foreign"
vendors from Arcador county, and
•which was commented upon by the
Ledger "of July 20 Our co temporary
gives  the sections of the license
ordinance under which the arrests
were made and the fines imposed
They are as followsPersonal
;  Section 13 For carrying on the
business of traveling merchant or
peddler, who sells, or retails, or
solicits for orders to be thereafter
[delivered, except by wholesale, any
merchandise, goods, wares or medi
cines shall pay the sum of $4 per
month or $10 per quarter; provided
however, that if any such traveling
merchant, or peddler uses in con
nection therewith any vehicle drawn
by-animal power, he shall pay the
sum of 16 per month or the sum of
$15 per quarter
_Sec 14 For carrying on the
business, of peddling (at either
wholesale or retail) cigars, bar sup
plies, wines, beer or intoxicating
Jiquors of any kind, or who solicits
for orders therefor to be thereafter
delivered by freight or otherwise,
shall pay the sum of $6 per month
or the sum of $12 per quarter
-We must admit that the wording
of the ordinance is sweeping, and
displays an intolerance out of joint
with our system of government We
are unable to see, even under the
local law, that the officials were
authorized in taking proceedings
against a baker of Jackson for de
livering bread to his customers in
Calaveras According to this in
terpretation, a rancher could not
sell a load of wood across the river
without paying a license Neither
could the foundry at Sutter Creek
supply the Gwin mine with ma
chinery without , being held up by
the license collector Not a stick of
timber could be sent from the out
side to the mines of Calaveras with
out subjecting the sender to the
payment of license Another point
is that while the ordinance permits
wholesale houses sending their
drummers into our sister county to
solicit orders without exacting a
license for that privilege (we pre
sume,  because the f ramers of the
law well knew that such interference
with trade has been declared uncon
stitutional) yet in delivering the
goods ordered they are liable to pay
$6 per month or $12 per quarter
They can take all the orders they
to, but must not execute the
orders without settling with the
county Does our cotemporary
think that such a palpable trap to
catch the  unwary would pass the
ordeal of the courts As a matter
of fact, is every wholesale house
Sending goods in Calaveras paying a
county license?
\ When the privilege of local legis
lature is so abused, is it not time to
agitate for taking away from the
counties the power to regulate
licenses, and demand that the state
authorities deal with this question,
which always has, and always will
be, a cause of more or less friction
so long as each county is given the
power to • set up barriers in restraint
of trade
 HIGH SCHOOL AGITATION
' Township Two is once more in the
throes of a high school agitatioD
This time the proposition is to in
clude all the school districts in
Township Two within the proposed
high school limits The school
would be located at lone, and the
entire township would be taxed for
its "supports Naturally the agita
tion is engineered from lone,
because, aside from the educational
advantages, it would tend to build
up the town The idea of building
up a community by having public
institutions quartered in its midst,
is a popular, but an erroneous one
It was the same notion that secured
the district fair and the race track
for the valley; but the benefits did
not materialize The Preston re
fprm school was also expected to
bring a boom to the valley town
But the boom has failed to connect
so far lone is the terminus of the
railroad, and the center of as fine a
tract of agricultural land as can be
found in the state Not only this,
but it is rich in mineral resources,
with vast beds of coal and pottery
clay comparatively untouched Its
future lies in the development of
these great natural resources And
it is pleasing to state, that a coal
mine is now being opened up near
Buena Vista, with a seam said to be
10 feet in thickness, and the coal of
a much better grade than any here
tofore found in that region There
is not the slightest reason to fear
that the educational system of lone,
or any other town for that matter,
vUI not keen pace v^ jtg
ment in population and industry
While the town population is appar
ently almost a unit in favor of the
high  school scheme, the outlying
districts seem to be just as strongly,
opposed to it Meetings have been
held in Julian and Jackson valley
districts, and public sentiment in
both places was decidedly adverse to
the movement  "

COMMUNICATION
• -- cv
; jACKSON^August 5, 1901
Editor Ledgerr - 
In view of your criticism against
me in the case of the' people vs J- C
McGregor, and believing that you have
been misinformed in relation to the
facts in the premises, and that both
sides to a controversy are entitled to a
fair and impartial hearing, and know
ing of no other way of preaching, the
readers of tho Ledger except through
its columns, I submit the followingPersonal
On the evening of July 16th there
appeared on the Main street of Jack
son a stranger accompanied by a little
girl, who at the time he claimed to be
only six years old, and gave an exhibi
tion with the child, the horrible de
tails of which has already been pub
lished I witnessed tho exhibition, but
not beinp certain as to the law in such
cases, and desiring to be right,' I took
no action at the time, intending to
look up the law at the earliest oppor
tunity Shortly afterward, during the
same evening, I was informed that the
same man was running a game on Main
street, for vhlch our county ordinance
(No 91, section 19, subd 11) provides a
tax of two dollars per day I arrested
the man and took him before the dis
trict attorney for the purpose of enter
ing a complaint, but upon listening to
his story I relented and let him go
upon the payment of the license, $200
The next morning I looked up the law
and found the followingPersonal Section 67;
Section 272 of said Code is hereby
amended to read as followsPersonal'
272 Any person, whether as "parent,
relative, guardian, employer, or other
wise, having the care, custody, or con
trol of any child under the age of four
teen years, who exhibits, or employs,
or in any manner or under' any pretense,
sells, apprentices, gives away, or lets
out, or disposes of any such child to
any person, under any name, title, or
pretense, for or in any business, exhi
bition, or vocation, injurious to the
health or dangerous to the life or limb
of such child, or in or for the vocation,
occupation, service, or purpose of Bing
ing, playing on musical Instruments,
rope or wire walking, dancing, beg
ging, or peddling, or »s a gymnast,
accrobat, contortionist, or rider in any
place whatsoever, or for or in any ob
scene, indecent, or immoral purposes,
exhibition or practice whatsoever, or
for any mendicant business whatsoever,
or causes, procures, or encourages such
child to engage therein, is guilty of a
misdemeanor, and punishable by tine
of not less than fifty dollars nor more
than two hundred and fifty dollars,' or
by imprisonment in the county jail for
a term not exceeding six months, or by
both such fine and imprisonment  ,
Section 68 A new section is here
by added to said Code, to be numbered
273, and to read as follows;
273 Every person who takes, re
ceives, hires, employs, uses, exhibits,
or has in custody, any child under the
age and for any of the purposes men
tioned in the preceding section, is
guilty of a like offense, and punishable
by a like punishment as therein pro
vided
"Section 273 a Any person who wil
fully causes any child to suffer, or who
inflicts thereon unjustifiable physical
pain or mental suffering, and whoso
ever having the care or custody of any
child, causes or permits the life or
limb of such child to be injured, and
; any person who wilfully causes or per
mits such child to be placed in such a
situation that its life or limb may be
endangered, or its health likely to be
injured, is guilty of a misdemeanor "
Believing that the law had been
plainly violated, and in pursuance of
what I believed to be my sworn duty,
I arrested the man As soon as I could
find the district attorney I lodged a
complaint, procured a warrant, and
brought the defendant before the
magistrate Thereupon the defendant
was admitted to bail in the sum of
fifty dollars, which he put up in cash
At the same time the defendant asked
the justice to restrain me from inter
fering with his exhibition pending the
defendant's trial The defendant was
thereupon informed by his own at
torney that he was liable to arrest
every time he attempted a like per
formance Tho same evening he went
upon the streets and gave another ex
hibiiiou which I saw and which I be
lieved to be in violation of law, and I
again arrested him and placed him in
jail The next morning as soon as I
could secure a warrant I brought him
before the justice, who fixed bail in tho
sum of one hundred dollars The de
fendant's counsel then asked to be per
mitted to withdraw the fifty dollars
deposited as bail In the first case, and
the defendant was committed to my
care pending trial The result of the
two trials is well known to the readers
of the Ledger At no time in either
arrest, or during his incarceration, did
I in any manner abuse or mistreat de
fendant, or the woman who claimed to
be his wife, or deny either of them any
privilege they were entitled to under
the law, for if I had done so they had
an attorney and "he could have pro
ceeded against me for any infraction of
the law During the whole proceed
ings I was actuated only by the desire
to protect the phild, and to enforce
what I believe to be a just and proper
law So much for the snake man
Now let's see about making tfee arrest
without warrant, etc
Section 836 of the Penal Code reads
as foltorsPersonal
Sec 836 A peace officer may make
an arrest in obedience to a warrant de
livered to him, or may, without a
warrant, arrest a person
First For a public offense committed
or attempted in his presence
Second When g person arrested has
committed a felony, although not In
his presence
Third When there is reasonable
cause to belie vp that such person has
committed a felony,
Fourth On a charge made upon
reasonable cause of a commission of a
felony by the party arrested
' 'Section 840 If the offense charged
is a felony, the arrest may be made on
any day, and at any time of the day or
night If it is a mjgden»e&ngr thq ar
rest cannot be made at night, 'unless
upon the direction of the magistrate,
endorsed upon the warrant, except
when the offense is committed in the
presence of the arresting pffjeef 1  '•'
I quote these sections not only to
show that I acted in accordance with
the law governing these matters, but
more particularly for the purpose of
callingPersonal the attention of the public to
the fact that any eitizon cgn make an
arrest in accordance yvitb t,he sections
quoted, as well as an officer, and if the
people will remember them, and act
accordingly, many criminals will be
apprehended who might otherwise
escape in the absence of an officer
In relation to any attempt of my
part to usurp the duties and preroga
tive of the constable, I believe that
every constable wjll bear me out when
I say that J have always tried to assist
them in their work without any undue
influence, and 1 am proud to say that
the constables of Amador county in
pb& past have always given me all the
assistance in their power; but it often
hapnens in tha absence of a constable,
I am obliged to do their work in order
to maintain the peace In such cases
only do I ever Interfere
The inference that I tried to manu
factory public sentiment through the
local p»pe»-s or by pending dispatches
to the city papers, is iyi£h#u£ any
foundation I had nothing- whatave?
to do with these matters, und can so
prove by the papers that published
the dispatches   ;
9 oft JWOg SWe and I»m gan* T h/)
bluff that the defendant's counsel tried
to make about a picked 'jury was un
true and uncalled for I consider it a
serious reflection on the 'constable of
township one, and am free to say in
his behalf that I do not Personal believe that
Ed Kay would allow the district at
torney, myself or any one else without
authority, to dictate to him in such
matters
In conclusion, allow me to thank you
in advance for your time and space
Conscious of having done mv duty
towards the people, and justified by
the law, and relying on the fairminded
nees and good judgment of my fellow
citizens, 1 submit my actions in this
matter for their consideration  Personal

A Big Excitement-
Last Tuesday, about 4Personal30 p m, quite
an excitement was occasioned at 'the
corner of Broadway and Water streets
A man named Giannini, who was driv
ing a ten mule team,' attempted to
round the corner just as Dick Calvin
was trying to do the same thing, and
as his mules had refused to obey bis
commands as quickly as he thought
they should do, he lost his temper, and
when he saw Calvin he attempted to
vent his spite on him, calling him all
kind of names After his vocabulary
of expletives had been exhansted, he
thought the time had arrived for
action, and he at once dismounted and
started with his "black snake" whip
wound round his hand, and holding it
with the loaded end hanging down, he
declared his intention to do him in
short order But he had not counted
on the opposition he was to encounter
When he arrived within about ten feet
of Calvin, he stopped suddenly and
listened to the advice of "Dick" to
"come no further, " and as the advice
was seconded by a gun looking him
square in the face, he concluded that
discretion was the better part of valor,
and quit
Poißoning Dogs
The dog poisoner has been getting in
his work around Jackson again Half
a dozen or more dogs on Main street
were poisoned the latter part of last
week, among them being a pet animal
belonging to Queen May Several of
the canines thus destroyed were worth
less, but with them some valuable dogs
were also lost This  dog poisoning
mania is periodical in Jackson It has
been going on for years at intervals,
and nothing has been done with the
view of getting to the bedrock of the
matter The laying of poison on the
streets or vacant lot is a crime with
severe penalties attached It is about
time something was done to stop this
business With poison spread around
indiscriminately, and thereby menacing
life, and with dynamite menacing prop
erty, we may well repeat the question,
"Whither are we drifting"
Mining Notes
Del Monte— The prospects at this
mine continue to look very encourag
ing In running the east drift at the
depth of 200 feet from the surface, the
ore chimney pinched out after extend
ing a distance of 209 feet The drift
was continued however, and after run
ning 10 feet further a narrow seam of
rich ore was encountered This has
widened out to a foot in thickness, and
still widening It looks as if a new ore
body had been struck, and of higher
grade than any heretofore encountered
The mill has not been started yet, the
intention id to wait until there is
enough rock in sight to run steadily
Central Eureka — In drifting at the
1800 foot level last Friday, another of
those rich ore deposits for which this
mine has been famous was encountered
This pocket is reported to be richer
than any heretofore found Over half
a ton of extraordinary rich rock was
taken out in two or three days The
aggregate value will run away up In the
thousands, although anything like |the
exact figures cannot be given at pres
ent The general outlook for this mine
is said to be brighter than ever

THE AMADOR I/EDGER; JACKSON, CAI^IFUKNttA, FBIPAY AUGUST 9 1901
Petition to Revoke Licenie
N A Eckart has presented a petition
to the board of supervisors, praying
that the license granted to G D Calvin
to retail liquors near the Tabeaud
reservoir, bo revoked; on the ground
that said business is conducted in a
noisy and disorderly manner; that on
every pay day, and for several days
thereafter, drunken and disorderly
persons are allowed to lie about said
premises; that intoxicating liquors are
sold to persons addicted to the inordi
nate use thereof ; and also to persons
under the age of 21 years The super
visors will meet In special session to
morrow to hear testimony pro and con,
and to determine said matter The re
sponded has secured N A Macquarrie
to conduct the defense
The company claim that the presence
of the saloon seriously retards the
operations at the reservoir It is only
one hundred yards from the place
where the Stone company pay off their
men Every pay-day and often for a
day or day thereafter the work-
Ing force is demoralized by the absence
of one or more of the head drivers—be
ing incapacitated by drink Most of
the men have a taste for liquor, and
one drink from the near-by saloon sets
them wild for more, and the fever is
communicated to others If there was
no saloon handy, the men would think
nothing about it, and keep right along
with their work Many of the men,
knowing their own weakness, have re
quested the company to withold their
wages until they get through, but one
drink scatters their good resolutions,
and work is then out of the question
until their money is gone The com
pany is carrying on a vast enterprise,
involving the expenditure of millions
of dollars in this county, and those in
charge say all they ask of the authori
ties is considerate treatment, that their
work be not hampered by licensed grog
shops within hailing distance of their
camps H Personal
Death from Sunstroke
A clear case of death from sunstroke
occurred at the Petty reservoir on
Saturday last The name of the victim
is given as Abel Tyrrell He
came from San Francisco only two
days before, for the purpose of work
ing for the Standard Co, in the con
struction of the reservoir Accustomed
to toil in the cool and humid climate of
San Francisco, and suddenly trans
ported in the hight of the hottest spell
experienced in this county for several
years, the change was too much for
him to stand He started to work Fri
day, and managed to get through the
day, although evidently distressed
Saturday morning he started again
He was running a scraper; it was the
hottest day of the season, and the bar
ren rocky surface of the excavated
reservoir made the heat still more try
ing to the workers It was noticed that
Tyrrell drank water freely and fre
quently, drinking as much as a quart
at a time About three o'clock he was
missed from his team His fellow la
borers went to see what was the matter
and found him lying on the ground in
a dying condition He was moved into
the shade, but never spoke nor re
gained consciousness, and died in a
short time The coroner was notified
and repaired to the scene at once, but
did not hold an inquest, as the body
had been removed before he got there
Deceased was a heavy set man,
about 45 years of age He was buried
in Jackson Sunday, by the company
This is the first fatal case of sunstroke
that has been recorded in Amador
county for many years

A careless person dropped a lighted

flash, burning bis rail fence for several
rods, running into the field without
permission, through the shocks of
grain which were yet remaining in the

cured the aid of twelve or fifteen men,

it had burned 69 or 70 shocks of grain,

AN OFFICIAL MIX UP
THE STORY OF AN APPOINTMENT
TO A JUDGESHIP- '-Personal2fjr
How the Man Slated For Associate
Justice of Sen- Mexico's Supreme
Court First Got a Surprise and Aft
erward the Office
Late in the year 1900 It was decided
by the powers in Washington that Mr
Daniel H McMillan, ex-state senator
of New York and for many years gen
eral counsel in the city of Buffalo for
the Vanderbilt system of railroads, was
to be appointed associate justice of the
supreme court of New Mexico
This appointment had been urged not
only by those who knew Mr McMillan
In the state of New York, but by law
yers of Santa Fe and of other cities in
New Mexico who knew of him and de
sired to see him obtain the place
Toward the close of 1000, with Gov
ernor Otoro of the territory, Mr Mc-
Millan was on a Lake Shore train
speeding toward Washington When
the train stopped at Painesvllle, 0,
newsboys boarded it, and one of them
called outPersonal "All about the new supreme
court -judge of New Mexico'- Silas
Alexander appointed" The governor
of the territory and Mr McMillan look
ed at each other, and they bought a
paper, and ln that paper they read in
glaring headlines that Silas Alexander
of Santa Fe had received the appoint
ment to the vacant judgeship
Mr McMillan the morning of his ar
rival ln the capital went at once to tho
office of the secretary of war
"How did it happen I was not ap
pointed?" he asked
"Why," said Mr Root, "you are ap
pointed!"
"Why," said Mr McMillan, "you are
mistaken" And he drew from his
pocket tlPersonal- rii'VPland newspaper of the
day before Secretary Root turned all
colors "This is a mistake" he said;
"an absurd, strange mistake, for I have
It from the president's own lips, cor
roborated by Mr Grlggs, attorney gen
eral, that your name was sent yester
day to the senate for action and that
the recommendation was duly signed
by President McKinley"
Then the men went to the state, war
and navy building and fouud Attorney
General Griggs
"But you have been given the ap
pointment," said Mr Griggs
"Then what does this newspaper re
port mean?" was the reply'  Personal'Personal '
The attorney general was damfound
ed "I cannot conceive what It means,"
lie said He tapped his bell, and wbeu
a messenger came In response he re
quested the attendance of the clerk In
confidential relations with him, whose
duty It is to till In upon appointment
blanks the names of those who are de
signed for appointments by the execu
tive Personal
The clerk appeared "Mr Blank,"
Bald the attorney general, "find out at
ence whose name was sent yesterday
to the senate with the recommendation
by the president that he be appointed
associate justice of the supreme court
of New Mexico"
"I will look," said the clerk He soon
returned with a memorandum slip In
bis hand
"Mr Alexander," he said— "the man
from Buffalo"
Then a glimmering of the truth
dawned upon the group "Are you
sure," said Attorney General Grlggs,
"that the name was not McMillan?"
"Certainly," was the reply "The
name was Silas Alexander"
The situation was remarkable, and
time wa's important
The president of the United States
had Inadvertently, by the error of a
subordinate, been made to set aside the
man whom be had Intended to name
There came a pause Mr Griggs
broke tbo silence
"Well, gentlemen," he said, "the fat
Is in the fire, but we must get It out
My subordinate has made this mistake,
and I must do my best to get It recti
fied, and perhaps the fault is partly
mine, for I Aid him to till In the name
of 'the Buffalo man,' and he, probably,
seeing the name Alexander and identi
fying It with the congressman of the
same name prominently known in
Washington as coming from Buffalo,
thought that be was to be the ap
pointee"
And so the three men went to the
president and explained matters, and
as a consequence a messenger, preced
ed by a telephone message, sped rapid
ly toward the capitol with Instructions
lo seek Immediately the leader of the
senate and prevent any action on the
mistaken nomination and to make the
statement to tiiat leader that it was
withdrawn
The messenger arrived just as the
senate was about to take action, and if
the telephone bad been relied upon the
nomination of Silus Alexander would
have been confirmed by the United
States senate, and the will of the pres
ident of the republic would have been
defeated— Saturday Evening Post

BATH OF THE ORANGE,
The Frntt Needs Mneh Groomlnfr Be-
fore It Is Ready For Market
Fresh from the tree an orange is still
very much alive, with the oil cells ex
panded and the mystery of growth not
yet suspended Cut off from the sap
supply, a change takes place- The skin
draws closer to the pulp and gives off
moisture that would cause sweating if
the fruit were packed at once But
first these dust stained travelers must
have a bath
By the bushel, if only this were the
land of the good old bushel basket the
newcomers are dumped into a long,
narrow tank of water at one end of
which is a big wheel with a tire of soft
bristles The wheel revolves so that
the lower edge works In connection
with another set of brushes In a small
er tank below, and the oranges, after
bobbing about in the big tank, pass be
tween the wet brushes and come out
bright and clean
This washer is a neat machine and
does away with the more primitive yet
picturesque, method of hand washing
At some of the smaller packing
houses may still be seen groups of wo
men, sometimes white, sometimes
brown skinned, each with a tub of wa
ter and brush, scrubbing busily away
at the yellow piles that never seem to
grow less till the last hour of the day
After their bath the oranges are
spread out In the sun to dry on long,
slanting racks At the lower end they
roll off Into boxes, to be carried away
to the warehouse for their rest
An orange needs a deal of grooming,
It would seem, before it is ready for
market The washing was not enough
There must be a brushing too And
after the days of curing the oranges
are fed into a hopper which drops them
single file on to a belt that runs be
tween revolving cylindrical brushes,
this for a smooth, shiny look— Los An

It's curious how the names of towns
and" streets come from something that
has been the fashion of the day Who
knows where the word "Piccadilly"
originated from, the name of that won
derful street of which it is written
that "some make love and some make
poetry in Piecadill?" The street was
built by a tailor named Higgins, whose
fortune was made in a kind of collar
called Piccadel or Pickadill or Plcca
dllley, which was worn by all the beaus
of the day Of course it is not meant
that the street as It stands today was
built by him, but he erected a few
houses to which he gave the name the
street now bears

intoxication, with his outer garments
removed and neatly folded up at his
side The proctor awoke him and sent
him to his college with an order to
appear the ne^xt day for judgment

trite frame of mind White said to
himPersonal 'You deserve an exemplary pun

Old Time Legislation Against the
Use of Tobacco
It is one of the curiosities of old time
legislation that the use of tobacco was
in early colonial days regarded by the
magistrates and elders as far more in
jurious, degrading and sinful than that
of intoxicating liquors Both the use
and the planting of the weed were for
bidden, the cultivation of it being per
mitted only in small quantities, "for
nieere necessitie, for phisick, for pres
ervation of the health, and that the
same be taken privately by anncient
men" But the "creature called tobac
ko" seemed to have an Indestructible
life Mrs Alice M Earle writes of
these early restrictions about tobacco
In "Stagecoach and Tavern DaysPersonal"
Landlords were ordered not to "suf
fer any tobacco to be taken into their
houses" on penalty of a fine to the
"victualler" and another to "the party"
that takes it" The laws were con
stantly altered and enforced, and still
tobacco was grown and was smoked
No one could take it "publicquely" nor
in his own house or anywhere else be
fore strangers Two men were forbid
den to smoke together
No one could smoke within two miles
of the meeting house on the Sabbatb
day There were wicked backsliders
who were caught smoking around the
corner of the meeting house and others
on the street, and they were fined and
set in the stocks and in cages
Until within a few years there were
New England towns where tobacco
smoking ln the streets was prohibited,
and innocent cigar loving travelers
were astounded at being requested to
cease, smoking
Mr Drake wrote in ISS6 that he
knew men, then living, who had had to
plead guilty  or not guilty In a Boston
police court for smoking in the streets
of Boston
In Connecticut in early days a great
indulgence was permitted to travelers—
a man could smoke once during a jour
ney of ten miles
HE DID HIS BEST
Celebrated Mnstcian's Adventure In
a Swiss Country Village
The late Sir John Stainer, one of
England's most celebrated musicians
and composers, was several years ago
In a small Swiss village, and the Eng
lish clergyman was on the lookout for
a musician to assist at the service
Stainer was in the smoking room of
the hotel when the clergyman found
him and started the conversation with
"Do you play the harmonium?" "A lit
tle," was the reply of the ex-organist
of St Paul's cathedral "Will you,
then, be good enough to help us out of
our difficulty on Sunday? We will
read the psalms, and the hymns sjiall
be the simplest I can select," added
the delighted parson -"I will do my
best," said Stainer, witn a smile
The service passed off all right, but
the congregation, Instead of rushing
away at the close, listened to a brilliant
recital When' the parson heard the
name of his assistant, he asked him to
dinner "Do you smoke?" he said at
the close "I will do my best," mut
tered Stainer, and the ensuing laugh
ter was the prologue of an entertaining
exchange of Oxford reminiscences
Stainer was a great story teller One
anecdote he was fond of relating had
reference to the days when there were
amateur orchestras in churches The
"Messiah" was being sutig, and as the
line "Who Is the King of Glory?" ap
proached the man playing double bass
whispered to the violoncellist in front
of him, "Let us have your rosin, and 1
will show 'em who Is the king of glo

ONE OF BROOKS' PUPILS
Ue Was Vnjnstly Punished, but Be
Forgave the Offense
After his graduation from j Harvard
college Phillips Brooks became a
teacher In the Boston Latin school
And here, on the very threshold of his
career, he met with failure So much
had been expected of him that his
waut of success was naturally a sub
ject of much comment at the time, and
after he had become a great preacher
his early failure was still referred to
and sometimes was used to point a
moral
It was a turbulent class that Phillips
Brooks bad to teach Before he took
charge of it three teachers had been
driven away The man who followed
Mr Brooks, to fill out the year, con
fessed himself so wearied by the fre
quent resort to corporal punishment
that he was obliged to betake himself
to the mountains for the summer to
recuperate his strength The boys
were certainly ln fault but the blame
was not wholly theirs, and long since
they may be supposed to have repented
of their mischief
Phillips Brooks was then not yet 20
years old, little more than a boy Nat
urally, perhaps, he made mistakes On
one occasion, says his biographer, he
punished a boy who bad committed
no fault
After Mr Brooks had become bishop
of Massachusetts, as he was moving
in his majestic dignity across -Boston
Common, be met this boy, then a ma
ture man occupying a post of trust and
influence Neither man had forgotten
the incident
Looking down upon bis old pupil, the
bishop made a certain appeal for for
giveness "Tell me, now," he said,
"that I did not make a mistake and
punish the wrong boy"
"Yes, you did make a mistake You
punished the wrong boy," was the an
swer, "but I have missed so many pun
ishments that I deserved that I ought
to be grateful for that one, which I did
not deserve"— Youth's Companion
