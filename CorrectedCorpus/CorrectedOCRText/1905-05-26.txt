Nearly he whole own hail assem
bled o wach he final sruggle or
he life of John l'reeiiau 11  was o'i
rial lor he murder of Oyius Max
well, and all he eidence li>ul been
hoard
The  prosecuion had eealilisLed a
srong circumsanial case — here was
no direc eidence of he pmner'd
guil
" Cyrus Maxwell is dead," ussered
one ciizen, "aud some one killed
him If John Freeman dliln'l do i,
who did? Tell me ha?"'
No one could {ell, and he belief
was general ha Freeman would be
coniced He said ba be had no
money, aud a young aorney rlio fel
lile ineres in he case had been
appoined o defend "him"
 few days before he rial a srau
ger appeared, had a consul aiou wih
he prisoner and laer me (be I'risou

npy ook no par in hem, and jjiaid
bu lile aeuiou o he rial
The prisoner was a young man an'
comparaiely a sranger The man
lie was licensed o slaying was no re
as a paricularly desirable
ciizen; if a plea of self defeune had
baen made and had beeu fairly well
esablished, he communiy would
hae been clad i John Freeman hud
been se free Bu he deleuse was
an alibi, Le mos dangerous defense
ha can be made when s no clear
ly proen; and John Freeman did no
proe  complee alibi
Few winesses wero examined fur he
defense; heu he srauge aorney
rose o make a plea for he prisoner,
ie was all and dignified His smooh
jhaen face was clean aud his eyes
were sharp Picures of such a face
may be found banging on ho walls o
many a sae uapiol iii ho Souh
His hair was whie aud long and as
line as silk His frock cna wag bu
oned ighly around bis slender form
and a black sring ie was knoed
around bis all collar
The aorney paid no aenion o
he jury He addressed he cour and
said a few words ba were scarcely
audible o hose in he jury box, and
which were enirely los o he spec
aors ba crowded he cour room
Then he urned o he prisoner, gazed
for a momen on he young man, and
saidPersonal
"John, my boy, you mus die You
mus leae he world in which you
hae spen only your youh, and mus
go o anoher world abou which we
hae all surmised much, bu of which
we know lile nd you mus die by

"You mus die he deah of a felon
in he manner prescribed by he sa
ue Bu i will be hrough no aul
of yours, and hrough no faul of he
judge 01 jury nd s no faul of

he man who swears falsely I canno
always ake ino accoun he misakes

he wounded and dying illed he air
" Your faher reooered, and for
many years he repaid by his ender
deoion he braery of ha loing
wife We laid his maimed body o
res only las week, John, lie is
sleeping wih his forebears in he
lile cemeery you remember so well,
and in which 1 promise ha you

die ainosg srangers, John, bu your
body will heu Jie among your kins
men, by he side of ha faher and
anoher who loed you so well
"Bu his case does no end here,
John There is anoher woild and
anoher judge Your parens are
here, John, hi<J you will be wih
hem soon nd hem his case will
be ried again before a judge who is
all wise, and before whom false wi

hey will know ha beir confidence

From hese reurns we hae com

I will hus be seen ha he only

he heay increase in Jackson dis

Offse he loss in he rural disrics
Township one has oer onehird of
he census children^ while Jackson
alone lias onefifh The yam in

of populaion coninues o be
away from oulying disrics, and
in faor of he owns Townrip 5
is he greaes loser, indicaing a
loss of 100 in oal populaion in
wele monhs
Bu by far he mos serious aspec
of he census is he seady decline
of he infan populaion We hae
los 6 children under lie years in
he pas year The logical conclu
of his is an alarming decline of he
birh rae Children are passing
ino he schoolroom wihou a corre
sponding filling of he gaps in he
ranks of he under age infans If
his endency is general— as i prob
ably is i shows a decreasing birh
rae The naural increase of popu
laion is no sufficien o offse he
raages of deah This endency is
perhaps more pronounced i a min
ing communiy like mador han in
an agriculural secion; inasmuch as
he proporion of married men is no
doub smaller, while he deahrae
is larger, owing o he perils inci
den o a miner's life Sill he

perhaps, is noiceable in oher sec

ha oer a million foreigners hae

ry own, prilK, 1905 »"aDombey, a resident of Railroad Flat,
had his throat out by another ludian
by the name of Jack, who lives at El
Dorado. Dombey, who is. now on the
road to recovery, came very near go
ing to the happy hunting ground,
as . the knife just missed the jugular
vein. The kuife weilder is still at
large.— Calaveras Chronicle.
A clothes cleanei from lone was in
town Thursday soliciting busineas,
says the Calavuras Chronicle, and
hitched his horse_to a barb wire fence
near the Gobbi residence. The animal
stuokjiis foreleg through the iouce,
severing an artergy in the leg, and
nearly bled to death before the vet
el iuary could take the animal in
charge.
John and Polk Loveless of El Dor
ado have made a wonderfully rich
strike on the Loveless place on the
Logtowu ridge. About a month ago
the two brothers started to work on
the property^ and in the intervening
time have taken out ore approximately
valued at Sio,ooo. One speoimen
taken out measures nearly a foot in
diameter, and contains about $3500
in gold. About 55000 worth of ore has
been realized from ore already
crushed. Beveial tons, of extremely
richjrock are packed ready tor ship
ment. Lee Loveless is now associated
with his brothers in the mine, and
the three brothers are now working
it.— Placerville Nugget.
James Trevithick, for many years a
resident of Soulsbyville, died in that
place last Monday of miner's con
sumption. He was born in Cornwall
69 years ago, and throughout his life
followed the occupation of miner.
He leaves two sisters, residents of
Sutter Creek, Amador county, also
James and Phil Littlejohn, nephews,
of Tuolumne.— Democrat. • '■}?'

The services for the dead of the Com :
panions weie read by the officers of

Mrs Dufrene was laid at rest in lone
cemetery. She leaves a husband, two
daughters, a son, mother and brother
to mourn her death.— Echo.
Word was received in lone Monday
morning of the death of Miss Nellie,
the only daughter of A. W. Sherwood
and wife, which occurred at the
family home in Sacramento Sunday
night, from typhoid fever. She was
fifteen years and four months old.

neighborhood, the family having re
moved to Sacramento but a few years

and two uncles to mourn her untime

THE lONE PICNIC.
At tho picnic in love on the 17th,
Miss Gladys McKenney was the Alay
Queen, with Alma Shaul doing the
crowning act. The baseball game
between the lone and Jackson grain
mer school teams, was closely con
tested, the former coming out victor
ious with a score of 8 to 5. The
basket ball game between two teams
of the Union High school, represen
ted by red and white badges, was
worn by the whites, the score being
3to 1. A baseball game between Ply
mouth and Volcano resulted in favor
of the PJyniouthites, score 0 t<j 1.

Albert Sutherland; relay race by Vol

also the special 100 yaids race; three
legged race, Fred Duulap and Jesee
Cliton.
Scientists tell us that out of a
bushel of corn the distiller get four
gallons of whiskey. Perhaps the far
mer gets fifty cents for the bushel of
corn. The United States government
gets 54,40, the railroad company gets
81, the retailer gets §7 and occasion
ally adds water and a few cheap
chemicals and his profit increase to
more than double the figure given.
A farmer near here, who is of a
sporting disppositiou, recently re
ceived a flue chicken. Supposing it
to be a token of appreciation from a
discriminating frieud.he took it home
for dinner. The following day he re
ceived this letter: "Dear Jack: Yes
terday 1 sent you a chicken in order
to settle a dispute which had arisen
here. Can you tell us what the chick
en died of?"
